0,加利福尼亚州水务工程的新问题,New Questions Over California Water Project
1,该隧道项目受到布朗以及加利福尼亚州中部和南部一些具有政治影响力的供水管理区和用水客户的支持。,The tunnels project is endorsed by Brown and by some politically influential water districts and water customers in Central and Southern California.
2,支持者们表示，这两条隧道将使环境受益并帮助加利福尼亚州确保供水更加安全。,Supporters say the tunnels would benefit the environment and offer Californians a more secure water supply.
3,反对者们则表示，他们担忧该州将通过这两条隧道从萨克拉门托河以及旧金山湾中分流太多的水，从而对加利福尼亚州北部造成损害，并进而威胁那里物种的生存。,"Opponents say they fear the state will use the tunnels to divert too much water from the Sacramento River and San Francisco Bay, harming Northern California and further endangering native species there."
4,由于不确定此项庞大支出是否真能为它们带来足以降低水价的水量，预计将从隧道取水的大城市供水管理区和其他供水管理区尚未做出承担有关费用的承诺。,"Metropolitan and other water districts slated to get water from the tunnels have yet to commit to paying for them, out of uncertainty whether the massive spending would really bring them enough water to make the cost worthwhile."
5,这些供水管理区今年也都宣称，在该工程获得监管部门的批准之前，它们不会为完成当前的初期工作而承担费用。,The same water districts also announced this year they would not pay to complete the current preliminary work on the tunnels unless the project first won regulatory approval.
6,周四，洛杉矶供水管理区就该隧道项目发表的一份月度报告指出：“本州已经指出，为完成规划阶段的工作所需的任何额外资金将由州或联邦的资金来源提供。”,"On Thursday, a monthly report published by the LA-based water district on the tunnels project said, ""the state has indicated that any additional funding needs to complete the planning phase will be provided by state or federal sources."""
7,洛杉矶供水管理区发言人鲍勃·缪尔表示，在各个地方供水管理区都为该项目投入资金（其中包括出自他所在的供水管理区的6300万美元）之后，“可以预料的是”该州将使用政府资金来帮助完成规划阶段的工作。,"After all that local water districts had spent on the project, including $63 million from his water district, ""This is to be expected"" that the state would use government money to close out planning, said Bob Muir, spokesman for the LA-based water district."
8,他向州发言人沃格尔提出了进一步的问题。,"He referred further questions to Vogel, the state spokeswoman."
9,沃格尔表示，该州打算从用于现有的已使用了半个世纪的供水网络（即：州水利工程）的用户费中提取资金，用于完成该隧道项目的规划。,"Vogel said the state intended to pull money to finish the tunnels planning from user fees for an existing, half-century-old water network, the State Water Project."
10,不过，隧道项目的反对者们转而诉诸于州议员于2009年通过的一项法案，他们说该法案禁止该州投资于这些隧道，除非受益的各水务部门承诺承担隧道的费用。,"Tunnel opponents, however, point to a measure state lawmakers passed in 2009 that they say bars the state from spending money on the tunnels until the water agencies that would benefit commit to paying for them."

32,内森·波义耳在下半场开场不久便得手，舒伯特攻入第四粒入球，随后凯斯·沃德迟来的吊球铸就了芬恩公园的溃败。,Nathan Boyle fired home early in the second half and Schubert hammered in the fourth before Keith Ward's late lob completed the Finn Park rout.

35,虽然犯规看起来是在发球区以外，在夏兰·科尔对舒伯特犯规之后，迈克奈夫于17分钟痛快地打入第一粒进球。,"McEneff tucked away the opener on 17 minutes after Ciaran Coll's challenge on Schubert, although the foul appeared to be outside the box."
36,毫无疑问，第二次罚点球是前德利城队中场球员巴里·莫洛伊撂倒了舒伯特，这样迈克奈夫就在第一粒进球三分钟之后再次将比分扩大至2-0。,"There was no doubt the second spot-kick, with former Candystripes midfielder Barry Molloy bringing downing Schubert and McEneff making it 2-0 three minutes from the break."
37,再度开球后八分钟，波义耳利用迪恩·贾维斯的一次回传球冷静地打入一粒进球。,Boyle produced a clinical finish from a Dean Jarvis cut-back eight minutes after the restart.

39,83分钟时，舒伯特带球晃过科尔劲射入门，不久之后，沃德以一记巧妙的高球越过了费恩哈普的盯人中卫李察·布殊。,Schubert flicked the ball past Coll before blasting in after 83 minutes and it was soon followed by Ward's clever chip over Harps stopper Richard Brush.

41,高地与群岛大学因弗内斯学院课程大规模失败探究,Probe after mass failure of Inverness College UHI course
42,整个班级20名学生可能都已无法通过由高地与群岛大学因弗内斯学院管理的高等传媒课程考试。,An entire class of 20 students may have failed a Higher Media course run by Inverness College UHI.
43,该课程的大多数学生年龄为17岁和18岁，希望凭借在学习中取得的成绩而进入大学。,Most of those on the course were 17 and 18-year-olds hoping to use their mark from their studies to go to university.
44,高地与群岛大学因弗内斯学院表示，学校的质量保证程序在正常运作，此外苏格兰学历管理委员会(SQA)也在进行调查。,"Inverness College UHI said quality assurance processes were in place, adding that the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) was investigating."
45,苏格兰学历管理委员会的一名发言人表示，全国范围的2016年高等传媒评定已“如期进行”。,"A spokesman for the SQA said the nationally-available 2016 Higher Media assessment had ""performed as intended."""
46,这二十名学生都报名参加了由高地与群岛大学因弗内斯学院管理和记分的这一课程。,Twenty students signed up for the Inverness College UHI-run and marked course.
47,这些学生中有不少是来自乡村地区的年轻人，他们接受的是在线授课，但也必须经常从他们的居住地（如：洛哈伯）赶往位于因弗内斯的这所学院。,"Many of the students were young people in rural areas who received tuition online, but also had to make frequent visits to the college in Inverness from where they lived in places such as Lochaber."
48,其中一位学生的父亲表示，其女儿在社交媒体上张贴她的作业没有取得任何学分之后，至少有其他10名学生也出面表示他们的课程作业也没有获得任何学分。,"A father of one of the students said that, following postings by his daughter on social media about her no award for her work, at least 10 others had come forward to say they had also been given a no award for their course work."
49,他告诉英国广播公司新闻网苏格兰在线栏目，去年在高地与群岛大学因弗内斯学院学习同一门课程的另外约五名学生也联系说同样的情况也发生在他们身上。,He told BBC News Scotland online that about five other people who sat the same course at Inverness College UHI last year had also been in touch to say the same thing had happened to them.
50,这种情形意味着他的女儿无法确保进入格拉斯哥大学，不过由于她在学习期间取得了一些资质，她将可以获得另一所大学提供的录取机会。,"The situation meant his daughter not being able to secure a place at the University of Glasgow, but she will be able to take up an offer from another university because of qualifications she gained at school."
51,但是，该女生的父亲说，学习该学院传媒课程的其他学生却没那么幸运，他们现在“备受煎熬”，而且不确定其课程作业是否会被重新检视并被授予足以让其进入大学的分数。,"But her father said there were others who did the college-run media course who were less fortunate and were now ""in limbo"" and unsure if their course work would be re-examined and then given a mark that would allow them to take up university places."
52,因弗内斯学院是高地与群岛大学附属院校。,Inverness College UHI is part of the University of the Highlands and Islands.
53,高地与群岛大学因弗内斯学院院长兼首席执行官戴安娜·罗林森表示：“我们非常认真地对待学生的考试成绩和学业成就。”,"Diane Rawlinson, principal and chief executive at Inverness College UHI, said: ""We take exam results and student success very seriously."""
54,今年早些时候我们获得的优秀HMIE报告以及历年来我们在继续教育和高等教育领域所实现的学业水平不断进步就是明证。,This is evidenced by the excellent HMIE report we received earlier this year as well as the year-on-year improvements to attainment levels we have achieved in both Further and Higher education.
55,正如我们每年都会做的那样，我们正在对所有公布的成绩进行复审，将它们与每一位学生的预期得分进行比较。,"As we do every year, we are undertaking a review of all published results, comparing them against those projected for each student."
56,就这一特定课程而言，执行的有常规的质量保证程序，而且积分授予机构审核人最近报告说“该项学分的授予和管理具有显著优势”并确认“所作的评估判断符合国家标准”。,"In the case of this particular course, the usual quality assurance processes were in place and the awarding body verifier recently reported 'significant strengths in the delivery and management of this award' and confirmed that 'assessment judgements were consistent with the national standards set'."
57,在我们的请求下，苏格兰学历管理委员会目前正在对此事进行调查。,SQA are currently investigating this matter at our request.
58,苏格兰学历管理委员会的一名发言人表示：“我们很高兴2016年高等传媒评定如预期进行，它为考生提供机会展示他们对主题的理解。”,"A spokesman for the SQA said: ""We are happy that the 2016 Higher Media assessment performed as intended and it provided candidates with the opportunity to show their understanding of the subject."
59,许多考生表现强劲，我们看到同资质情况下的A-C达标率与去年相比有小幅提升。,Many candidates performed strongly and we saw a slight increase in the A-C attainment rate compared to the same qualification last year.
60,考试的设计与过去的试卷和样例试卷相一致，而且符合我们的课程与评定规范。,It was designed in line with past and exemplar papers and according to our course and assessment specifications.

75,这俩人在饮酒和吸毒之后前往受害人家中，用围巾蒙脸并持有一把匕首和武术用双截棍。,"The pair, who were high on drink and drugs, went to his home after masking their faces with scarves and arming themselves with a knife and martial arts nunchucks."

233,这样的爱心儿童阅读室既培养了孩子们的阅读习惯，也让孩子的暑假有了好去处。,"Such a reading room with love not only fostered children's reading habits, but also offered them a good place to go during the summer vacation."
234,除了筹集阅读室，众筹还为我国目前面临的严峻问题——留守儿童，带去了一丝的温暖。,"In addition to reading rooms, crowdfunding has also brought some warmth to left-behind children, a grave problem facing China now."
235,据悉，黄岩中西部共有留守儿童3000余名，大多数在家与年迈的爷爷奶奶一起生活，因为父母需要外出务工挣钱，他们甚至一年只能见上父母一面。,"Reportedly, there are more than 3,000 left-behind children in central and western Huangyan, most of whom are living with their elderly grandparents at home. Their parents have to work in other regions to earn money. Therefore, they may only see their parents once a year."
236,缺失亲情与正确引导，往往成为这些孩子童年成长中无法弥补的遗憾。,The lack of kinship and correct guidance frequently become an irretrievable pity for the kids during their growth.
237,集众人之力开办儿童阅读室、建设留守儿童之家，这样有意义的事情，除了众筹恐怕其他的行业再难做到了。,"It seems that launching reading rooms for kids, building homes for left-behind children, as well as other meaningful things alike can only be managed through crowdfunding."
238,“众筹作为互联网金融的一种新兴行业，正在逐步将它的优势扩散到每一个角落，众筹不仅改变了我们的生活环境，更在潜移默化的改变我们的思想。,"""As an emerging industry in Internet finance, crowdfunding is gradually extending its advantages to all aspects. It has not only changed our living environment, but also silently changed our ideas."""
239,晓风互金总经理韩建宇说到：我们晓风是做众筹系统的，我们自己的员工也曾因为家人生病而通过微信众筹来进行过爱心筹款。,"Han Jianyu, general manager of Xf.cc, said that Xf.cc is engaged in the establishment of a crowdfunding system. A staff member of the company has also raised funds through crowdfunding on WeChat after his family members were attacked by a disease."
240,在这里我想说的是，众筹代表的不止是一个行业，更是一种积极向上态度和一种乐于助人的精神。,"What I want to say here is that crowdfunding is not only an industry, but also a positive attitude and an accommodating spirit."
241,它没有界限，只要你有需求，只要你敢于发起众筹，那么一切皆有可能。,"It is boundless. If you need and are brave enough to initiate crowdfunding, everything will become possible."
242,更多中档车集中亮相，9月9日就来“鸟巢”车展买车！,"More intermediate vehicles are on display, buy vehicles at the ""bird's nest"" on September 9"
243,今年的齐鲁(济宁)秋季车展将于9月9日至12日在“鸟巢”亮相。,"The 2016 Qilu (Jining) autumn auto show will be held at the""bird's nest"" on September 9-12."
244,红馆作为豪华车展区2014年首次亮相齐鲁(济宁)车展十分成功，今年豪华车展馆依然将在车展中大放异彩。,"As an exhibition area for luxury vehicles, the Hongguan hall made its debut at the 2014 Qilu (Jining) auto show and made a hit. It is expected that the luxury vehicle exhibition hall will remain a highlight at this year's exhibition."
245,作为连接西展区和东展区的关键点，豪华车展馆不但高大上，更是吸引车展目光的制高点。,"The luxury vehicle exhibition hall, as the connection between western and eastern halls, will not only be high-end and luxurious, but also a spotlight of the exhibition."
246,随着换车季的到来，更多4s店推出各种中档车，让济宁市民有充分的选车空间。,"As the peak season for car owners to change their cars is forthcoming, more and more vehicle dealers have launched intermediate vehicles to offer plenty of choices for residents in Jining City."
247,广东城乡居民基本养老保险实行基础养老金与个人账户养老金相结合的待遇形式，其中基础养老金由政府全额支付，所需资金由各级财政分担。,Guangdong's basic endowment insurance system for urban and rural residents is comprised of a primary endowment insurance fund and a personal account endowment insurance fund. The primary endowment insurance fund was jointly paid by governments at all levels.
248,同时，现场了解商户对金融服务、业务等方面的意见和建议，努力完善提高服务质量，更好地为群众服务。,"In the meanwhile, the merchants' advice and suggestions on financial services and businesses were learned on the site, in a bid to improve services to better serve the public."
249,一架载有216人的空中客车A330双通道宽体客机12日中午缓缓从成都双流国际机场起飞。,"Carrying 216 passengers, an Airbus A330 double-channel wide-bodied aircraft took off from Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport on the noon of August 12."
250,成都直飞布拉格定期航班为每周二、五各执行一班，采用空中客车A330双通道宽体客机执飞。,The Chengdu-based airline will operate its Airbus A330 double-channel wide-bodied aircraft directly from Chengdu to Prague once every Tuesday and Friday.
251,定期直航的开通将进一步促进双边经贸往来，为中国西部地区赴中东欧旅游的游客提供更多便利。,It is expected that the opening of the regular direct route will further promote the bilateral economic and trade communications between the two regions and facilitate tourists from western China to Central and Eastern Europe.
252,捷克驻成都总领事馆领事多来哲表示，定期直航开通后，四川民众前往捷克就会更加方便，能更快地领略到捷克美丽的风光。,"Dolezal, a consul at the Czech Republic's consulate general in Chengdu, said that it will be more convenient for Sichuan residents to travel to the Czech Republic after the opening of the route. Thanks to that, they will be able to experience the beautiful sceneries in the Czech Republic sooner."
253,“这条线路不仅方便四川游客前往捷克，也方便了捷克人到四川旅游。”,"""The route will not only facilitate Sichuan tourists' travel to the Czech Republic, but also make it easier for the Czech people to visit Sichuan."""
254,多来哲说，捷克驻成都总领事馆早已开通签证服务，并在西南地区多个城市设立了签证中心，“我们建议最好提前两个礼拜或15天办理签证业务。”,"Dolezal said that the consulate general has already rolled out visa services and set up visa centers in many cities in southwestern China. ""We suggest applicants apply for visas two weeks or 15 days in advance."""
255,近年来，捷克已成为中国游客除法国外的欧洲第二大旅游目的地。,"Excluding France, the Czech Republic has become the second most popular tourism destination in Europe to Chinese tourists in recent years."
256,根据捷克国家旅游局公布的数据显示，中国每年赴捷克的旅游人数从2010年的8万人次升至2014年的25万人次。,"Data released by the Czech Tourism Authority showed that the number of Chinese tourist arrivals to the Czech Republic has soared from 80,000 in 2010 to 250,000 in 2014."
257,加拉加斯消息：在关闭近一年后，委内瑞拉和哥伦比亚两国当地时间11日就重新开放两国边界达成一致。,Sources from Caracas said that Venezuela and Colombia on August 11 agreed on the reopening of their border one year after the closure of the border.
258,上述决定是在委内瑞拉总统马杜罗和哥伦比亚总统桑托斯会谈后作出的。,The decision was made after President Maduro of Venezuela and President Santos of Colombia's meeting.
259,据英国广播公司报道，双方商定，第一阶段将开放两国边界线上的5个关口供行人出入境。,"According to BBC, only pedestrians will be allowed to cross in five places along the border during the first stage."
260,马杜罗在会谈后表示，希望通过开放边境能重新恢复与哥伦比亚的经贸往来，改善双边关系。,Maduro said after the meeting that he hoped the reopening of the border will help Venezuela resume its economic and trade communications with Colombia and improve the bilateral relations between the two countries.
261,桑托斯则强调，两国边境要“逐步”开放，且一切措施都将是临时的，将随时研究和调整每一步措施。,"Santos stressed that the border will be ""gradually"" opened. It will be a provisional opening as they learn and adjust their decisions every step of the way."
262,两国还同意将致力于重新开放全部边境，不过这需要双方在安全、商业和能源等方面先分别达成协议。,"Colombia and Venezuela also agreed to work towards the full reopening of the border, saying they needed first to reach separate agreements on security, commerce and energy."
263,去年8月19日，一队哥伦比亚准军事组织人员在委境内边界地区开枪打伤正在缉私的委国民卫队3名军人和1名平民。,"On August 19 last year, a group of Colombian paramilitaries shot a Venezuelan military patrol in riots with smugglers and wounded three soldiers and a civilian near the border."
264,马杜罗随后宣布与哥接壤的塔奇拉州5个城市进入为期60天的紧急状态，并关闭两国边界。,"Maduro then announced 60 days of martial law in five municipalities in the state of Tachira, which borders on Colombia, and the close of the border of the two countries."
265,此后，双方为解决边境危机多次举行会谈，两国还分别召回大使商讨情况。,"Afterwards, the two sides held many talks in a bid to resolve the crises. They also recalled their ambassadors for discussions."
266,去年9月21日，两国领导人举行会谈，并首次商定将逐步重新开放两国边界，实现两国关系正常化。,"On September 21, 2015, the leaders of the two countries held a talk and agreed to gradually reopen their border for the first time, so as to normalize their relations."
267,提到民族村寨，我们总会想到灵秀的山水、神秘的文化、淳朴的村民，然而在这背后还有难以忽视的贫困、寥落、凋敝。,"We always think of beautiful sceneries, mysterious culture and honest villagers while mentioning ethnic villages. However, the impoverishment, sparseness and desolation behind them cannot be ignored."
268,而在发展的过程中，错误的开发模式不仅没有拯救民族村寨的命运，甚至加速了村落和文化的消失。,"The incorrect exploration models during the development of ethnic villages not only haven't changed the destiny of the villages, but also accelerated the disappearance of the villages and their culture."
269,文化保护不是一个静态的概念，比如广西的刘三姐，刘三姐脱离了村落以后就失去了意义，场地的表演再精彩也缺乏了村寨的氛围。,"Culture protection is not a static concept. For instance, Guangxi's Liu Sanjie will become meaningless if it is broken away from villages. No matter how excellent it is, the atmosphere of villages will be lacked when it is staged in other places."
270,"泰国华欣等地发生多次爆炸,泰国军方：或有人企图制造混乱",Several Bombs Go off in Hua Hin and Some Other Regions in Thailand; Thai Military: Someone May Intend to Make a Mess
271,据中国之声《新闻晚高峰》报道，今天（12号），是泰国的母亲节。但本来应该是热闹、祥和的泰国街头，这一天却多了一些冷清甚至是紧张。,"CNR reported in an evening news program that a sense of desolation and even tension shrouded the streets in Thailand on August 12, the country's Mother's Day, when it should be lively and peaceful."
272,从当地时间11号晚间至12号上午，泰国著名旅游胜地华欣和南部省份接连发生了8次炸弹爆炸。,"From the evening of August 11 to the morning of August 12 (local time), eight bombs successively went off in Hua Hin, a renowned tourism attraction of Thailand, as well as some provinces in the south of the country."
273,11号晚上泰国华欣爆炸似乎成为仅仅眼下泰国系列爆炸案的开端。,The bomb in Hua Hin on the evening of August 11 seemed to be just the beginning of a series of bombs in the country.
274,在过去24小时内，接连8起爆炸袭击先后“造访”泰国南方五省，除了华欣被袭4次以外，另有2次爆炸在普吉岛，1次在素叻他尼，1次在南董里。,"In the past 24 hours, eight bomb attacks successively took place in five provinces in the south of Thailand, four in Hua Hin, two on Phuket Island, one in Surat Thani and one in Trang."
275,12号早上8点开始，素叻他尼府两所警察局门口分别发生爆炸，造成1人死亡，多人受伤。,"Two bombs exploded in front of two police stations in Surat Thani, respectively, after 8:00 on the morning of August 12, leaving one dead and many injured."
276,不久后，8点41分，普吉府著名巴东海滩又遭两起爆炸，爆炸地点依旧选择了路边警察执勤点。,Another two explosions hit two police stations at roadsides on the famous Patong Beach on Phuket Island at 8:41.
277,正值温馨母亲节、和泰国王后庆生日的今天，泰国多地笼罩在恐怖的气氛之下。,"It was the Mother's Day and the birthday of the queen of Thailand. However, many regions of the country were in a horrific atmosphere."
278,作为境外旅游机构的玩途自由行团队一位工作人员刚刚前往了爆炸发生地点。,"A staff member of Hitour, an overseas self-service tour service agency, has just paid a visit to one of the explosion sites."
279,到那个爆炸现场去看了一下，应该是一个小的东西，可能小炸弹，危害力并不是很大。,The attack may have been small with a small harm according to the explosion site.
280,泰国新宪法草案自公布之日起便伴随争议，争议焦点多集中于涉及军方权力的条款。,"Disputes have been raised over the draft of Thailand's new constitution since it was unveiled, with focuses on the clauses on military power."
281,支持者认为，新宪法能够治愈泰国国家撕裂的伤口，并且促进国家稳定。,Supporters believed that the new constitution can heal Thailand's wound and promote the stabilization of the country.
282,反对者认为，这是一场“不公平的公投”，一旦通过，将赋予军方更多权力。,"Opponents believed that this is an ""unfair referendum"". Once the constitution is passed, the military will gain more power."
283,尤其是新宪法草案引入的新条款，将削弱政党力量，让非选举产生的上议院议员拥有更大权力。,"Especially, the new clauses introduced to the draft will weaken political parties' power but give more power to non-elected senators."
284,英国《卫报》称，这一系列看来似乎是针对旅游胜地的协同袭击事件正发生在8·17曼谷爆炸案一周年前夕。,"The Guardian said that the attacks seemingly targeting tourism attractions actually happened before the anniversary of the Bangkok blast taking place on August 17, 2015."
285,国际观察人士分析称，最大的嫌疑是泰国的分离主义叛乱分子，这些人正在最南部的三个省份展开针对泰国军方的武装行动。,"International observers said that the country's separatists are the biggest suspects, who were in military actions against Thai military in the three southernmost provinces."
286,为此，近年来一些中国企业也在积极探索，尝试与大专院校及科研机构设立联合实验室、共建重点实验室。,"To that end, some Chinese companies have been actively trying to set up laboratories and key labs with colleges and scientific research institutions in recent years."
287,“发起产、学、研相关机构共同成立联盟，可以整合资源，加速科研进程。”,"""Encourage industrial, academic and research institutions to form an alliance can help integrate resources and speed up scientific researches."""
288,在成立大会后，药学产学研国际联盟又与温州医科大学—纽约大学结构生物学联合研究中心签约“基因工程药物国际合作开发”项目。,"After the launch ceremony, the international industry-college-research pharmaceutical alliance and the Wenzhou Medical University-New York University structural biological collaborative research center signed an agreement for the project of ""internationally collaborative development of genetically engineered drugs""."
289,美国5天内发生第4起游乐场事故：3岁男孩从过山车上摔下,US Sees 4th Amusement Park Accident in 5 Days: 3-year-old Boy Falls out of Roller Coaster
290,事情发生在匹兹堡中午时间，孩子送往医院时还能和家人说话，目前还不清楚具体的伤势。,The accident took place at noon in Pittsburgh. The boy could still talk with his family members when he was sent to the hospital. Details about his injury are still unclear.
291,这个过山车建于1938年，最高的地方有10米，并不是刺激类型的过山车，所以没有安全带。,"The roller coaster, which was built in 1938, does not include seat belts because it's not a stimulating one. The maximum height of the roller coaster is ten meters."
292,而且根据游乐场的规定，低于15米的游乐设施可以不需要家长陪同。,"According to the park's rules, riders don't need to be accompanied by their parents if the amusement facilities are lower than 15 meters."
293,事情发生后，宾夕法尼亚州对州内1万200个过山车重新检查。,"Pennsylvania is overhauling the 10,200 roller coasters in the state again after the accident."

296,双方还将共同打造农村电子商务全国性示范城市，推动产业结构调整和优化升级。,"The two parties will also jointly make Leting a national demonstrative city for rural e-commerce and facilitate the adjustment, optimization and upgrading of the county's industrial structure."
297,乐亭县域电商产业飞速发展，城乡群众生活水平和幸福指数明显提高。,"The e-commerce industry in Leting County is growing rapidly, pushing up the living standard and happiness index of both urban and rural residents remarkably."
298,王新亮表示，专门针对老年人诈骗的保健品公司一般都是类似的套路，即现场听讲座领奖品，然后忽悠买东西。,"Wang Xinliang noted that the elderly-cheating healthcare product companies usually adopt similar ways in cheating. They held lectures, offered presents on site and lured the elderly to buy their products."
299,“只要听一天讲座就能领5斤鸡蛋，拉来一个人还再多领5斤。”,"""People who listen to the lectures can get 2.5kg eggs for free and those who bring another person to listen to the lectures can get 2.5kg more."""
300,王新亮说，他接触过一个案例，买保健品的工作人员听课现场就喊爹喊妈，让老年人倍感亲切，但实际上是一种情感营销。,"Wang Xinliang said that he has once encountered a case, in which the healthcare product sellers call the elderly either fathers or mothers on lecture sites, which made the elderly feel at home. However, it was actually an emotional marketing trick."
301,“吃了之后感觉还行，一周后再去就涨到了3000元，我们就不买了。”,"""We felt the treatment effect was good after taking the products. However, they were marked up to RMB 3,000 one week later. Then, we didn't buy them again."""
302,王新亮表示，从近两年他接触的案例看来，老年人被诈骗的情况还是比较严重的，而且买药品、保健品和投资理财时遇到的诈骗居多。,"Wang Xinliang said that according to the cases he has encountered in recent two years. The elderly were easy to be cheated. Most of the frauds took place when they buy drugs, healthcare products and wealth management products."
303,“有的老年人买了一屋子保健品，还有的老年人退休工资很高，明知道被骗了还不接受子女劝说，有的还甚至产生了家庭矛盾。”,"""Some elderly people bought a great number of healthcare products. Some who have high retirement pay didn't follow their kids' advice although they knew they had been cheated. Some even had conflicts with their family members."""
304,据经济之声《央广财经评论》报道，网购正成为很多人的日常消费方式，在购物体验不符合预期时，有多少人会给差评呢？,"According to the report of an economic comment program of CNR-2, online shopping is becoming the daily consumption means of many people. How many online shoppers will give a negative comment when shopping experience falls short of their expectations?"
305,56.4%的受访者认为消费者的差评权是网络虚拟社会中大众监督机制的客观体现，79.3%的受访者认为有必要出台相关措施保障消费者差评权。,"About 56.4% respondents of the survey said consumers' right to give negative comments is an objective reflection of the public monitoring system in the virtual online society, while 79.3% believed that it is necessary to launch relevant measures to protect consumers' right to give negative comments."
306,"但是，商家的""压力""决不能靠非法手段释放，而对于消费者而言更应该行使好手中的权力。","However, merchants' pressure should never be released through illegal means, while consumers should make good use of their rights."
307,如果说消费者的评价是中肯的，你应该接受这种评价，去改进服务提升品质。,"If the comments of consumers are pertinent, you should accept such comments and improve your services."
308,如果个别人的评价是出于其他的不当竞争行为，你可以通过反不正当竞争法的相关规定去主张权利。,If someone's comments are aimed to weaken your competitiveness on purpose. You can safeguard your rights according to the regulations of the anti-unfair competition law.
309,如果他恶意诋毁，使你的商业信誉、信用受到损失，你可以提起民事诉讼，也可以向相关部门报案。,"If their malicious slanders damage your business reputation and credits, you can lodge a civil litigation or report the case to relevant authorities."
310,尽管法律有规定，比如因为你的评价，商家把你的信息公开，实际上侵害消费者的名誉权以及信息安全权，但是如果提起诉讼费时费力。,"According to relevant regulations in law, if merchants publicize your information to revenge you for your comments, they are actually infringing your reputation and information security rights. However, it will cost a lot of time and efforts for you to file a lawsuit against them."
311,相关行政部门在查处的时候，平台一定要起到监督、约束的作用。,E-commerce platforms have to give play to their monitoring role when relevant administrative departments are investigating and dealing with such cases.
312,另一方面通过行政法规，公布个人信息要承担责任，对这个网络诋毁或者是恶意中伤交易相对也要有一个严格的规定，行政的处罚行政的规制要跟上。,"On the other hand, those who publicize others' personal information should be held responsible through laws and regulations. Also, there should be a regulation on the punishment of online slanders."

318,董扬表示，现在我们是119家整车企业，预计两年内达到条件的新增整车企业为10家左右，所以对格局影响很小。,"Dong Yang said that we currently have 119 complete new-energy vehicle makers and about ten more qualified ones are expected to be launched within the next two years. Therefore, there will be little impact on the landscape of the new-energy vehicle industry."
319,据俄罗斯卫星网报道，俄罗斯克里姆林宫发布消息称，俄总统普京解除了谢尔盖·伊万诺夫的总统办公厅主任职务。,"According to Sputnik, Russia's Kremlin revealed that Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed Sergei Ivanov from the director of his president office."

327,公交司机由于和阿婆语言无法交流，无奈送至辖区红岛边防派出所。,The impossibility of the bus driver to communicate with the old lady in language forced him to escort her to the nearby Hongdao Border Police Substation.
328,当晚22时，阿婆的家属见其外出未归随即报警，才得知阿婆在红岛派出所，于是才到该所接回阿婆。,"At 10 o'clock that evening, the family members of the old lady were informed that she was in the Hongdao Police Substation after they called the police because she did not come back home, and then went to the substation to bring her home."
329,公交公司工作人员通过观察发现，阿婆穿着得体且很干净，不像是在外流浪的老人，家庭条件应该可以。,"Through observation, the worker of the bus company found that the old lady dressed properly in clean clothes, and judged that she did not look like an old woman straying outside and coming from a humble background."
330,交流了1个小时以后仍得不到有用线索，不得已工作人员只能将阿婆送至辖区红岛边防派出所，希望通过警方的力量帮助老人找到家人。,"Since the worker could not get any valuable clues after one-hour communication, he had to escort the old lay to the nearby Hongdao Border Police Substation and hoped that the police will help the old lady find her family members."
331,随后民警开始耐心询问起来阿婆，可是老人仍然无法与民警正常交流。,"Then, the police talked with the old lady with patience, but she still could not normally communicate with them."
332,当晚22时，家住海甸岛居民杨先生打电话报警称，自己80多岁的老母亲当天下午走失了，至今仍无音讯。,"At 10 o'clock that evening, Mr. Yang who lives on Haidian Island called the police and said that his 80-year-old mother got lost in the afternoon and there was no news about her till then."
333,红岛派出所接警发现，杨先生表述母亲的特征和走失阿婆特征比较吻合，于是告知杨先生到所里来认人。,"When responding to the call, the police of the Hongdao Police Substation found that what Mr. Yang described about her mother fit in nicely with the characteristics of this lost old lay, and informed him of coming to the substation to make identification."
334,随后，杨先生和侄子一同到红岛边防派出所寻找母亲，果然该所里的阿婆正是杨先生的老母亲。,"Then, Mr. Yang together with his nephew went to the police substation, and found that the old lady there was exactly his mother."
335,对此，杨先生感谢民警及时找到自己的母亲，在确定老人身体无恙后，将老人接回了家。,Mr. Yang thanked the police for their finding his mother in time and then brought her home after confirming that she's fit.
336,据杨先生介绍，母亲今年80多岁，安徽人，今天下午，老母亲告知家属称去楼下散步，当时家属也没有放在心上。,"According to Mr. Yang, his 80-plus-year-old mother, who hails from Anhui province, told the family members that she wanted to go out for a walk this afternoon, but they did not think about that."
337,等到晚上19时许，见母亲迟迟未归，于是发动亲戚朋友在家的周边和海甸岛一带寻找，仍无踪迹。,"At about 7:00 pm, he hadn't seen his mother coming back home yet, so he requested his relatives and friends to search his mother around his home and the Haidian Island, but it did not work."
338,他还称，母亲不会自己坐公交车，估计是被好心人扶上车的，其又有点老年痴呆，糊里糊涂就不知道坐去哪里了。,"He also said that his mother has never taken a bus by herself, and guessed that it might be some good-hearted people helped her go onto the bus. Since she is suffered from minor senile dementia, she did not know where she had gone herself at that time."

451,国王普密蓬·阿杜德是世界上在位时间最长的君主。,King Bhumibol Adulayadej is the world's longest-serving monarch.
452,乌克兰问题迹象提示：弗拉基米尔·普京在做什么？,Signs of Trouble in Ukraine Prompt Question: What's Vladimir Putin Up To?
453,很难判断这些主张的真相究竟是什么。,It's difficult to judge the truth of these claims.
454,乌克兰予以否认，美国和欧盟则表示俄罗斯没有提供任何证据。,"Ukraine denies them, and both the United States and the European Union say Russia has provided no evidence."
455,数字取证研究实验室（一家开源分析组织）发现一些迹象显示周六发生过一次交火，但莫斯科的夸大说辞几乎没有依据。,"An open-source analysis group, the Digital Forensic Research Lab, found some indications of a firefight on Saturday, but little to back up Moscow's grander claims."
456,俄罗斯为政治目的而扭曲或谎报事件已为人所知，尤其是在乌克兰仍持续冲突的迷雾中。,"Russia has been known to distort or misstate events to serve political ends, particularly within the fog of Ukraine's still-ongoing conflict."
457,这并不意味着俄罗斯的主张都是虚伪的。,That doesn't mean that Russia's claims are all false.
458,去年，乌克兰民间武装破坏了为克里米亚供电的输电塔，其中有些人还卷入了刑事犯罪和破坏人权的活动。,"Ukrainian militias last year sabotaged electricity pylons that power Crimea, and some of them are involved in criminal activity and human rights violations."
459,在克里米亚发生一次未遂袭击并非不可能，尽管几乎没有理由怀疑乌克兰政府会支持这样的阴谋。,"An attempted attack in Crimea is not out of the question, though there is little reason to suspect the Ukrainian government would sponsor such a plot."
460,无论发生了什么，开源分析师发现的图像显示，至少从周六（所谓的袭击发生之前）开始，俄罗斯在克里米亚的军事存在就一直在升级。,"Whatever happened, images found by open-source analysts suggest that Russia has been escalating its military presence in Crimea since at least Saturday - before the supposed attack occurred."
461,这些图像显示重型武器护送部队在该半岛上移动，其中包括海岸防御用导弹系统。,"These show convoys of heavy weapons moving on the peninsula, including missile systems intended for coastal defense."
462,熟悉却又令人不安的俄罗斯式升级,A disturbingly familiar Russian escalation
463,一些报道显示，俄罗斯驻克里米亚的军队早已计划好在现阶段进行一次新的轮换，这有助于解释有关活动，尽管很巧合的是这刚好发生在自2014年侵吞事件以来局势最紧张的时期。,"Some reports indicate that Russia's troops in Crimea were already scheduled for a new rotation about now, which would help explain the activity, though it would be quite a coincidence that this just happened to fall during some of the highest tensions since the 2014 annexation."
464,不论这个周末发生了什么，普京先生针对乌克兰的发言无疑已经升级，选择利用这一插曲（不论它的真实程度如何）达到某种更大目的。,"Whatever transpired over the weekend, Mr. Putin has unquestionably escalated in his language toward Ukraine, choosing to use this episode - however real it was - for some larger aim."
465,分析家指出，这与俄罗斯早先针对乌克兰的军事行动之前的表现有令人不安的相似之处。,Analysts have pointed out disturbing parallels with how Russia behaved just before previous military actions against Ukraine.
466,在2014年2月，类似的言论和军事演习为克里米亚志愿民兵抢占该半岛提供了掩护，当时克里米亚半岛仍归乌克兰控制，结果只表明这些民兵实际上是俄罗斯发动军事占领的特种部队。,"In February 2014, similar speeches and military maneuvers provided cover for Crimean volunteer militias to seize the peninsula, then still controlled by Ukraine, only to reveal they were in fact Russian special forces launching a military occupation."
467,在那年8月，随着受俄罗斯支持的分离主义者在东乌克兰节节败退，普京先生沿边境驻扎军队，警告称他们可能有必要“保护”在乌克兰的俄罗斯族平民，他说那些平民正在被袭击。,"That August, as Russian-backed separatists lost ground in eastern Ukraine, Mr. Putin stationed troops along the border, warning they might be necessary to ""protect"" ethnic Russian civilians in Ukraine who he said were under attack."
468,他策划了一支援助护送部队进入该地区，不过北约称此举仅仅是为了掩盖俄罗斯侵略军。,"He orchestrated an aid convoy into the region that, according to NATO, was mere cover for a Russian invasion force."
469,普京先生究竟在克里米亚策划什么？,What is Mr. Putin planning in Crimea?
470,有些人想知道莫斯科是否可能在阴谋发动又一次干预。,Some have wondered whether Moscow might be plotting another intervention.
471,东乌克兰的战事已经升级，正如2014年8月入侵之前的情况一样。,"Fighting has increased in eastern Ukraine, as it did before the August 2014 incursion."
472,不过，这种看上去相似之处可能就是重点，意在营造对军事行动的恐惧，而非实际行动，这将使普京先生在与乌克兰和西方国家的博弈中掌握很有份量的筹码。,"But that seeming parallel may be the point, meant to create fear of military action - rather than actual action - that will give Mr. Putin leverage with Ukraine and with Western countries."
473,纽约大学研究俄罗斯事务的教授马克·加莱奥蒂指出，克里米亚作为集结地用于针对东乌克兰的军事行动是毫无意义的，东乌克兰毗邻俄罗斯大陆而非克里米亚，而且这个国家其他地区的防御情况较好。,"Mark Galeotti, a New York University professor who studies Russia, pointed out that Crimea would make little sense as a staging ground for military action against eastern Ukraine, which borders mainland Russia but not Crimea, and that the rest of the country is better defended."
474,加莱奥蒂先生说：“俄罗斯人不可能是在真正策划某种重大攻势。”,"""It's highly unlikely that the Russians are truly planning some major offensive,"" Mr. Galeotti said."
475,相反，“我们所看到的是俄罗斯人经典的制造紧张的策略。”,"Rather, ""We're looking at a classic Russian strategy of building up tension."""
476,普京先生曾通过乌克兰问题国际和平会谈机制迫使因俄罗斯吞并克里米亚而回避他的西方领导人与其接触，现在这种会谈机制已经变得越来越徒劳无用。,"International peace talks over Ukraine, once the mechanism by which Mr. Putin forced contact with Western leaders who had shunned him over annexing Crimea, have become increasingly regarded as fruitless and irrelevant."
477,通过利用悬而未决的新冲突威胁，普京先生为这种会谈提供了一条新的理由：劝导他悬崖勒马。,"By dangling the threat of renewed conflict, Mr. Putin gives the talks a new purpose: to coax him back from the brink."
478,谈到计划于9月初举行的下次和平会谈时，加莱奥蒂先生表示：“这是一种标准的普京战术，他想在参加会谈之前先占据优势地位。”,"""It's a standard Putin tactic - he wants to try to go there from a position of strength,"" Mr. Galeotti said of the next peace talks, planned for early September."
479,唯一的真正优势就是说：“只要我愿意，我可以让事情变得越来越糟糕。”,"""And the only real strength is to say, ""I could make things much, much worse if I wanted to."" """
480,与西方讨价还价的定位,Positioning for a bargain with the West
481,普京先生本周还说，在克里米亚局势紧张时期继续谈判毫无意义，迫使其他各方劝说他回到谈判桌上，这样就使得他自己处于这种进程的中心。,"Mr. Putin also said this week that it made little sense to continue negotiations amid the Crimea tensions, forcing the other parties to persuade him to come back to the table - and putting himself at the center of the process."
482,实际上他这样做能获得什么？,What does this actually get him?
483,首先，这使得俄罗斯可以继续声称它是一个世界大国，哪怕它的敌人比澳大利亚还小。,"For one, it allows Russia to continue asserting itself as a global power, even though its economy is smaller than Australia's."
484,其次，这使得莫斯科占据对乌克兰的主权拥有否决权的地位，使这个国家在某种程度上处于俄罗斯的控制之下。,"For another, it positions Moscow as having a veto over Ukraine's sovereignty, keeping the country within some degree of Russian control."
485,这还服务于普京先生长期秉持的与美国进行一宗大交易的愿望，顺理成章地以对莫斯科有利的条件来解决双方在乌克兰和叙利亚问题上的纷争，并终结西方对俄罗斯的制裁。,"It may also serve Mr. Putin's long-held hopes of a grand bargain with the United States that would settle their disputes over Ukraine and Syria - on terms favorable to Moscow, naturally - as well as ending Western sanctions against Russia."
486,从俄罗斯的敌人在2014年末开始崩溃起，普京先生就反复暗示过这一目标，很大程度上是归因于俄罗斯石油与天然气出口价值的下滑。,"Mr. Putin has repeatedly hinted at this goal since his nation's economy began collapsing in late 2014, due mostly to the declining value of its oil and gas exports."
487,自去年秋季介入叙利亚问题以来，他已多次邀请西方大国与他一起结为对抗极端分子的大同盟。,"Since intervening in Syria last fall, he has repeatedly invited Western powers to join him in a grand coalition to fight extremists."
488,不过，俄罗斯领导人可能认为他们需要在1月奥巴马总统离职之前确保达成这样一种交易。,"But Russian leaders may believe that they would need to secure such a deal before January, when President Obama will leave office."
489,俄罗斯官员倾向于将希拉里·克林顿视为可能的继任者而且对莫斯科更具敌意。,Russian officials tend to view Hillary Clinton as the likely successor and as more hostile to Moscow.
490,唐纳德·特朗普虽然明显对俄罗斯较友善，但仍被视为不可预测。,"Donald J. Trump, while conspicuously friendly toward Russia, is still seen as unpredictable."
491,不过，加莱奥蒂先生说，奥巴马先生被视为是“寻求解决而非冲突”的人。,"But Mr. Obama is seen as ""looking for resolutions, not conflicts,"" Mr. Galeotti said."
492,因此，有一种机会之窗正在关闭的感觉，需要加快完成一些事情。,So there is a sense that there's a closing window of opportunity to get something done quickly.
493,同时，如果没有达成任何重大交易，普京先生也乐见让俄罗斯的弱势邻居猜想然后会发生什么。,"In the meantime, should no grand bargain come, Mr. Putin appears happy to keep Russia's weaker neighbor guessing about what's coming next."
494,本文稍早前的一个版本写错了俄罗斯侵入乌克兰吞并克里米亚的年份。,An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine.
495,实际应该是2014年而非2013年。,"It was 2014, not 2013."
496,国会僵持不下，白宫腾出资金对抗寨卡,"With Congress Deadlocked, White House Diverts Funds to Fight Zika"
497,"奥巴马政府周四表示，该政府正在从生物医学研究以及反贫困与医疗保健计划中腾出8,100万美元资金用于开发寨卡病毒疫苗，采取这种非常规措施是因为国会没有批准为对付这种病毒所需的新的拨款。","The Obama administration on Thursday said it was shifting $81 million away from biomedical research and antipoverty and health care programs to pay for the development of a Zika vaccine, resorting to extraordinary measures because Congress has failed to approve new funding to combat the virus."
498,美国卫生与公共服务部部长西尔维娅·马修斯·波维尔在致国会议员的一封信中表示，若没有腾出的这些钱，美国国立卫生研究院和生物医学高级研究与发展管理局会在月底用完为对付这种蚊子传播的疾病所拨付的资金。,"Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, told members of Congress in a letter that without the diverted funds, the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority would run out of money to confront the mosquito-borne illness by the end of the month."
499,在迈阿密本地感染寨卡病毒案例增长之时，疫苗开发工作会在关键阶段因缺乏资金而被迫中止。,"That would force the development of a vaccine to stop at a critical time, as locally acquired cases of Zika infection increase in Miami."
500,"据疾病控制和预防中心报告，截至上周，美国已经出现7,350例寨卡病例，其中大多数发生在波多黎各。","As of last week, 7,350 cases of Zika had been reported in the United States, most in Puerto Rico, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
501,波维尔女士表示，已经有15名婴儿出生时患有寨卡病毒所引起的先天缺陷。,Ms. Burwell said that 15 infants had been born with Zika-related birth defects.
502,这种病毒可以在被感染孕妇所产下的孩子身上引起脑部发育异常以及其他严重缺陷。,The virus can cause abnormal brain development and other serious defects in children born to infected mothers.
503,上个月末已经出现了该疾病在美国大陆本土传播的首批案例，围绕联邦政府所作响应的政治筹码也相应增加。,"The local spread of the illness in the continental United States, with the first cases reported late last month, has raised the political stakes surrounding the federal government's response."
504,希拉里·克林顿周二在温伍德开展竞选活动，这个毗邻迈阿密的城镇已经出现一连串本地传播的寨卡病例，迫使国会中断五周的休会期以通过对抗该病毒的紧急拨款。,"Hillary Clinton on Tuesday made a campaign stop in Wynwood, the Miami neighborhood that has had a rash of locally transmitted Zika cases, and pressed Congress to return from its five-week break to approve emergency funding to fight the virus."
505,奥巴马总统和国会共和党人在今年大多数时间里均在寨卡病毒问题上意见不合。,President Obama and congressional Republicans have been at odds for most of the year over Zika.
506,二月，奥巴马先生请求紧急拨款19亿美元。,"In February, Mr. Obama requested $1.9 billion in emergency funding."
507,共和党人拒绝了这一请求，要求提供有关这笔资金的去向的更详细账目。,"Republicans balked, demanding a more detailed accounting of where the money would go."
508,数月以来，议员们一直在争执应该拨付多少专款和专款应该如何专用。,Lawmakers have feuded for months over how much money should be earmarked and how it should be spent.
509,上个月，民主党否决了共和党提出的一项提议，该提议要求拨款11亿美元抗击寨卡但包含禁止资助计划生育协会提供与病毒相关的避孕条件的条款，而寨卡病毒可以通过性途径传播。,"Last month, Democrats blocked consideration of a Republican measure that would have allocated $1.1 billion to fight Zika but included provisions that would have banned funding for Planned Parenthood to provide contraception related to the virus, which can be sexually transmitted."
510,这种僵局促使白宫于四月从埃博拉病毒研究资金中腾出5.89亿美元用于抗击寨卡病毒的工作，这笔资金中约有三分之二指定在美国境内使用。,"The deadlock prompted the White House in April to shift $589 million in Ebola funding to the Zika effort, about two-thirds of it designated for domestic use."
511,周四，波维尔女士表示，她的部门已经使用了那笔资金中的一大半，到八月末时就会全部用完。,"On Thursday, Ms. Burwell said that her department had used most of that money, and that it would be gone by the end of August."
512,波维尔女士写道：“由于应对寨卡病毒的紧急追加拨款未能获得通过，政府被迫在延迟关键疫苗开发工作和挪用其他有价值的政府项目的资金以暂时避免延误之间作出选择。”,"""The failure to pass a Zika emergency supplemental has forced the administration to choose between delaying critical vaccine development work and raiding other worthy government programs to temporarily avoid these delays,"" Ms. Burwell wrote."
513,民主党人利用这份公告指责共和党人未能为抗击寨卡病毒提供额外资金。,Democrats seized on the announcement to berate Republicans for failing to provide additional money for Zika.
514,在新闻发布会上，加利福尼亚州众议员、少数派领袖南希·佩洛西呼吁众议院议长保罗·瑞恩将国会重新带回推动此类措施的轨道上来。,"At a news conference, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, called on Representative Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, to bring Congress back to advance such a measure."
515,佩洛西女士表示：“所有可能的选择都在被耗尽，现在我们打算去国立卫生研究院，这是一个优先选项。”,"""Every possible option is being exhausted, and now we're going into the National Institutes of Health, which is supposed to be a priority,"" Ms. Pelosi said."
516,瑞恩先生的助手表示，腾出那些资金是奥巴马政府拖延了很久的一个步骤，旨在从寨卡病毒问题中压榨出尽可能多的政治优势。,Aides to Mr. Ryan said that shifting the funds was a long-overdue step that the Obama administration had delayed to squeeze maximum political advantage out of the Zika issue.
517,美国国立卫生研究院上周宣布，该院已经开始在80名人类受试者身上开始一种寨卡疫苗的临床试验，并有望于2017年初在“寨卡病毒流行国家”开始二期试验。,"The National Institutes of Health announced last week that it had begun clinical trials of a Zika vaccine on 80 human subjects, and hoped to begin a second phase in ""Zika-endemic countries"" in early 2017."
518,不过，由于现在没有更多资金，周四有官员表示该研究会中途而止。,"But without more funding now, officials said Thursday, the research would halt in its tracks."
519,"波维尔女士表示，她会从国立卫生研究院被指定用于研究其他疾病治疗（例如癌症和糖尿病）的资金中划转3,400万美元用于寨卡病毒研究。","Ms. Burwell said she would transfer to the Zika efforts $34 million in N.I.H. funds that had been designated to find treatments for other diseases, including cancer and diabetes."
520,"另有4,700万美元资金将被划拨给生物医学高级研究与发展管理局，支持响应公共卫生突发事件的药物与疫苗开发。","Another $47 million will be transferred to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which supports the development of drugs and vaccines to respond to public health emergencies."
521,"这些钱将出自多种账户，其中包括从一项为低收入家庭提供取暖油补贴的计划中划转的1,900万美元，以及从应对药物滥用（例如阿片成瘾）的计划中划转的400万美元。","That money will come out of a variety of accounts, including $19 million from a program that supplies heating oil subsidies for low-income families and $4 million from substance abuse programs such as those for opioid addiction."
522,波维尔女士表示，即使那样，这些补充资金也只能应付到下个月，到那时，若国会再不采取行动的话，对抗寨卡病毒的研究机构将不得不“严重削弱许多关键性的工作”。,"Even then, Ms. Burwell said, the additional money will last only through next month, at which point agencies would have to ""severely curtail many of their critical efforts"" against Zika without action from Congress."
523,"在过去的四个月里，疾病控制与预防中心花费了6,000万美元用于帮助各州为孕妇提供保护，2,500万美元用于加强各州为寨卡疫情所作的准备和响应计划，以及1,600万美元用于帮助各州创建数据收集系统以便快速检测小头畸形和其他寨卡相关的综合症状。","In the last four months, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spent $60 million to help states protect pregnant women, $25 million to strengthen their Zika preparedness and response plans, and $16 million to help them create data-collection systems to quickly detect microcephaly and other Zika-related syndromes."
524,泰国领导人认为针对旅游景区的袭击与宪法更替有关,Thai Leader Links Attacks on Tourist Sites to Constitution Change
525,泰国军政府首脑周五敦促国民在调查人员判定本周泰国系列致命炸弹爆炸案幕后元凶的期间保持耐心。,The head of the Thai junta urged his countrymen on Friday to have patience while investigators determine who was behind a wave of deadly bombings in Thailand this week.
526,军政府首脑兼总理巴育·占奥差将军暗示，肇事者是“一些坏人”，他们反对泰国选民周日在全国公民投票中通过的新宪法。,"Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, the junta chief and prime minister, hinted that the perpetrators were ""bad people"" opposed to a new Constitution that was approved by voters on Sunday in a nationwide referendum."
527,他在发表全国演说时表示：“仍然有些坏人，他们在公民投票开始之前就一直在行动。”,"""There are still bad people, and they have been acting since before the referendum,"" he said in an address to the nation."
528,周四和周五发生在五个省份的炸弹爆炸事件导致四人死亡，几十人受伤，遭袭地点包括旅游胜地普吉和华欣。,"The bombings in five provinces on Thursday and Friday, including in Phuket and Hua Hin, areas popular with tourists, killed four people and injured dozens."
529,有关部门表示，发生在泰国其他的纵火袭击事件也似乎有关联。,The authorities said arson attacks elsewhere in the country appeared to be related.
530,分析家表示，这些炸弹爆炸事件似乎不是为了杀害许多人，而是为了破坏作为泰国为数不多的经济亮点之一的旅游业。,"Analysts said the bombings did not appear to be aimed at killing many people, but rather at damaging the tourism industry, one of the few bright spots in Thailand's economy."
531,在华欣至少有九名外国游客受伤。,At least nine foreign visitors were injured in Hua Hin.
532,人权观察组织高级研究员苏奈·帕苏克表示：“不论动机是什么，这些爆炸和纵火袭击动摇了军政府提出的关于公民投票之后形势会保持稳定的主张。”,"""Whatever the motives are, the explosions and arson attacks undermine the junta's claim that the post-referendum situation would be stable,"" said Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch."
533,这些袭击事件制造了抹黑权威部门、恐吓公众和损害基于旅游业的经济的效果。,"These attacks create effects that discredit the authorities, terrorize the public and harm the tourism-based economy."
534,照片 泰国救援人员治疗在周五华欣炸弹爆炸案中受伤的一名受害者。,Photo Thai rescue workers treated a victim injured by a bomb that exploded in Hua Hin on Friday.
535,警方表示，他们不认为这些炸弹爆炸事件与国际恐怖主义或者与泰国南方长期存在的伊斯兰叛乱有关。,The police said they did not believe that the bombings were tied to international terrorism or to a long-running Islamic insurgency in southern Thailand.
536,他们将这些袭击描述为“地方性的破坏活动”而非恐怖主义。,"They have portrayed the attacks as ""local sabotage,"" not terrorism."
537,这些袭击发生的时机和地点都具有强烈的政治象征意义。,The timing and location of the attacks carried strong political symbolism.
538,炸弹爆炸发生在人们准备在周五为皇后诗丽吉庆祝生日之际，在泰国这一天也被视为母亲节。,"The bombings occurred as people prepared to celebrate the birthday of Queen Sirikit on Friday, which is considered Mother's Day in Thailand."
539,四枚炸弹袭击了华欣的皇室居住小镇，华欣距离曼谷约125英里，大多数伤员出自那里。,"Four bombs struck the royal residential town of Hua Hin, about 125 miles from Bangkok, where most injuries occurred."
540,由军方起草的宪法将削弱政党的影响力并赋予军方更大权力，即使在军方将政府交由文官掌控之后也依然如此。,The military-drafted Constitution will diminish the influence of political parties and give greater power to the military even after it returns the government to civilian control.
541,军政府通过防止反对者发动对其不利的运动来确保其胜利果实。,The junta helped ensure its victory by preventing opponents from campaigning against it.
542,华盛顿美国国际战略研究中心东南亚事务专家默里·希伯特注意到泰国军方怀疑这些袭击事件的元凶是对投票心怀不满的人。,"Murray Hiebert, an expert on Southeast Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, noted the military's suspicion that the attacks were carried out by people disgruntled over the vote."
543,他说，这些炸弹爆炸事件“明显经过协调但显然意在制造恐怖和焦虑的气氛而非制造大规模的破坏与伤亡”。,"The bombings were ""clearly coordinated but obviously intended to create fear and anxiety rather than massive damage and deaths and injuries,"" he said."
544,去年，在曼谷旅游景点伊拉旺神祠发生的一起炸弹爆炸事件导致20人死亡，其中大多数是中国游客。,"Last year, a bombing at the popular Erewan shrine in Bangkok killed 20 people, most of them tourists from China."
545,泰国官员将该起炸弹爆炸案归因于一百多名维吾尔人被遣返中国惹恼了维吾尔族武装分子。,Thai officials attributed the bombing to Uighur militants angry over the return of more than 100 Uighurs to China.
546,巴育将军自2014年泰国一场政变推翻了民选政府之后就一直领导着军人集团，他说本周的炸弹爆炸事件让泰国人民“伤心”。,"General Prayuth, who has led the junta since a 2014 coup ousted a civilian government, said this week's bombings ""hurt the hearts"" of Thai people."
547,他说：“为何是现在，当国家形势、经济和旅游业都正在好转之时？”,"""Why now, when the country is getting better, the economy is getting better, and tourism is getting better?"" he said."
548,我们必须问一问是谁为了什么而这样做。,"We have to ask why, and who did it."
549,夺冠反应：西蒙·曼努埃尔的历史时刻看起来如何,Golden Reaction: What Simone Manuel's Historic Moment Looked Like
550,就在今晚进入本场比赛时，我有点想摆脱自己肩负的黑人群体的重担，我肩负着它来到这个位置。,"Just coming into this race tonight, I kind of tried to take the weight of the black community off my shoulders, which is something I carry with me just being in this position."
551,但是我真的希望它消失掉。,But I do hope that it kind of goes away.
552,我感到无比高兴的是自己能给其他人以鼓舞，并希望推动体育事业的多样性。,I'm super glad with the fact I can be an inspiration to others and hopefully diversify the sport.
553,不过同时我也想能有一天不只是黑人游泳运动员西蒙，而是有更多的黑人出现，因为黑人游泳运动员的头衔听起来就像是我本不应成为有能力夺得金牌或者有能力打破纪录的人。,"But at the same time I would like there to be a day where there are more of us and it's not Simone, the black swimmer, because the title black swimmer makes it seem like I'm not supposed to be able to win a gold medal or I'm not supposed to be able to break records."
554,事实不是那样，我就像其他任何人一样努力地工作，而且我热爱这项运动，而且我就像其他任何人一样希望夺取胜利。,That's not true because I work just as hard as anybody else and I love the sport and I want to win just like everybody else.
555,哥伦比亚保护非异性恋学生的斗争,The Fight to Protect L.G.B.T. Students in Colombia
556,两年前，16岁的塞尔吉奥·阿瑞格在波哥大一所购物中心跳楼结束了他的生命，他在脸谱网留下的自杀遗言引用了平克·弗洛伊德的歌词“Goodbye Cruel World”。,"Two years ago, 16-year-old Sergio Urrego jumped to his death from a shopping center in Bogotá, leaving as his suicide note a Facebook post quoting Pink Floyd's ""Goodbye Cruel World."""
557,他的死成为本周让哥伦比亚躁动不安的一场辩论的开端，因为为LGBT群体争取更大权利的努力被卷入了一场更为广泛的政治斗争，使这个国家陷入意见的两极分化。,"His death was the genesis of a controversy that roiled Colombia this week, as the effort to expand L.G.B.T. rights was drawn into a broader political fight that has polarized the nation."
558,在阿瑞格死后，他的妈妈阿尔瓦·雷耶斯起诉了学校官员，指责他们在发现她唯一的儿子与一名同学存在亲密关系之后故意将他排斥在群体之外。,"After his death, Mr. Urrego's mother, Alba Reyes, sued school officials, faulting them for ostracizing her only son after discovering that he and a classmate had an intimate relationship."
559,一年以后，哥伦比亚最高法院进行最终裁决支持了她的观点，呼吁全国的学校制定更加明确的防歧视政策。,"A year later, Colombia's highest court issued a sweeping ruling in her favor, calling on schools nationwide to develop clearer policies to prevent discrimination."
560,该裁定是哥伦比亚同性恋权利运动所取得的一系列法律胜利的一部分，今年早些时候哥伦比亚裁定同性婚姻合法化也使同性恋权利运动为之欢庆。,"The decision was part of a string of legal victories for Colombia's gay rights movement, which earlier this year celebrated a decision that legalized same-sex marriage."
561,不过，这个星期他们争取平等的斗争碰了壁，教育部长、公开的同性恋者吉娜·佩若蒂在裁决实施的过程中成为一起丑闻的爆发点。,"This week, though, their fight for equality hit an obstacle as Gina Parody, the minister of education - who is openly gay - became the flashpoint of a scandal over the implementation of the ruling."
562,当某色情杂志的性暴露内容开始在社交媒体上流传而且散播者宣称它是教育部颁布的指导手册的部分内容时，争执爆发了。,"The fracas started when sexually explicit content from a pornographic magazine began circulating on social media, peddled by people who claimed it was part of a guidance manual issued by the education ministry."
563,佩若蒂女士很快揭穿了那个谎言。,Ms. Parody quickly debunked that.
564,虽然教育部就有关性取向和性别认同的问题为各学校提供指导以帮助它们注意该裁定，但却没有寻求强行实施标准化规则。,"While the ministry offered guidance to schools on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity in an effort to help them heed the ruling, it has not sought to impose standardized rules."
565,在周四的一次访谈中佩若蒂女士表示：“我们所希望的是学校能有解决冲突的手段。”,"""What we want is for schools to have the tools to resolve conflicts,"" Ms. Parody said in an interview on Thursday."
566,在以“被政府和哥伦比亚革命武装力量（游击队组织）的和平谈判所撕裂的国家的未来”为话题进行的一次全国性辩论中，这一争端开辟了一条新的战线。,"The dispute opened a new front in a national debate over the future of a country torn over peace negotiations between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC, a guerrilla group."
567,反对政府的政治家联盟和天主教会领袖以超常的速度动员起来，指控总统胡安·曼努埃尔·桑托斯领导的政府推动同性结合与性别流动。,"A coalition of politicians opposed to the government and leaders of the Catholic Church mobilized with extraordinary speed, accusing the government of President Juan Manuel Santos of promoting same-sex unions and gender fluidity."
568,节外生枝的是，最近在哈瓦那与哥伦比亚革命武装力量进行谈判的政府代表团就性别和LGBT平等问题达成了协议，该协议呼吁政府采取更具包容性的政策。,"To complicate matters, the government delegation negotiating with the FARC in Havana recently reached an accord on gender and L.G.B.T. equality that calls on the government to adopt more inclusive policies."
569,对政府及和平谈判持批评意见的人对哥伦比亚政坛的后起之秀、42岁的佩若蒂女士展开了猛烈抨击。,"Critics of the government - and the peace talks - pounced on Ms. Parody, a 42-year-old rising star in Colombian politics."
570,他们在集会上出示了粗鲁的海报，有些人威胁要对她和她的伴侣、前商务部长塞西莉亚·阿尔瓦雷斯·科雷亚·格伦采取暴力行为。,"They displayed crude posters at rallies and some threatened violence against her and her partner, Cecilia Álvarez-Correa Glen, the former commerce minister."
571,在那令人不快的一周里，佩若蒂女士非常坚忍，她试图澄清误解并重新建立有建设性的辩论。,Ms. Parody remained admirably stoic throughout the bruising week as she sought to set the record straight and recast the debate on constructive terms.
572,她说：“使我保持坚强和清醒的部分原因是，我知道就在那里有些孩子正在出柜（公开承认性取向）的过程中。”,"""Part of what has kept me standing and clear-headed is knowing that there are kids out there who are in the process of coming out of the closet,"" she said."
573,这是一个艰难的阶段，而且是一个非常孤独的时刻。,This is a tough stage and a very lonely time.
574,她还把和平进程与关于LGBT学生的争论联系起来。,She also drew a connection between the peace process and the debate over L.G.B.T. students.
575,她说，随着哥伦比亚人继续权衡与哥伦比亚革命武装力量达成协议的好处，对于这个国家而言这将是一次震撼世界的转折点，他们必须考虑冲突的根源。,"As Colombians continue to weigh the merits of a deal with the FARC, which would mark an seismic turning point for the country, they must consider the roots of the conflict, she said."
576,她说：“一个和平的国家应该促进包容还是纵容排斥；它是否应该让所有人都享有平等的机会？”,"""Is a peaceful country one that promotes inclusion or exclusion; is it one in which everyone has equal opportunities?"" she said."
577,虽然她对自己成为本周受侮辱和骚扰的对象感到很不愉快，但让她感到欣慰的是，在如今的哥伦比亚，同性恋学生可以抬头面对她并且心里想着他们也可以立志有朝一日成为部长。,"While she takes no pleasure in having been the target of insults and harassment this week, she is glad that in today's Colombia, gay students can look up to her and consider that they, too, can aspire to serve as a minister one day."
578,佩若蒂女士表示：“对我而言，重要的是他们可以轻松自在并且意识到他们可以发挥自己的全部潜力。”,"""To me, it's critical that they can be at ease and that they realize that they can reach their full potential,"" Ms. Parody said."
579,我们不能等到下一起自杀事件才着手改变。,We can't wait for a new suicide to start changing.
580,确保选举网络安全——纽约时报,Keeping the Vote Cybersafe - The New York Times
581,根据8月4日发表的《美国寻求杜绝黑客染指投票箱的办法》的新闻报道，,"In ""U.S. Seeking Ways to Keep Hackers Out of Ballot Box"" (news article, Aug."
582,美国国土安全部部长杰伊·约翰逊表示，奥巴马政府正在讨论为美国的选举制度增加额外的保护措施。,"4), Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson says the Obama administration is discussing giving extra protections to the nation's electoral system."
583,这一改变可能很必要而且应考虑立即实施。,This change may be necessary and should be considered immediately.
584,网络威胁具有多样化的性质，而最近有迹象显示一些外部作用因素（可能是民族国家）对影响美国的选举表现出了更大兴趣，因此联邦政府迫切需要对国家选举制度的安全保障给予额外的关注，并将它视为美国关键的基础设施的组成部分。,"The diverse nature of the cyberthreat, and the recent revelation that outside actors, possibly nation-states, have an increased interest in influencing our elections, make it imperative that the federal government give additional attention to securing our electoral system and possibly deem it part of our nation's critical infrastructure."
585,事不宜迟，约翰逊先生应与美国数千个帮助开展选举的管辖区进行沟通，并提供国土安全部的协助、专业知识和指导。,"Without delay, Mr. Johnson should communicate with the thousands of jurisdictions in the country that help carry out elections and offer the Department of Homeland Security's assistance, expertise and guidance."
586,我们的投票基础设施有各种不同类型，使得安全保障工作面临窘迫境地，但这也告诉我们应尽早启动该进程。,"While the diverse and varied nature of our voting infrastructure confounds efforts to secure it, this tells us that the process should begin as soon as possible."
587,文章作者是众议院国土安全委员会高级官员，密西西比州民主党人。,"The writer, Democrat of Mississippi, is the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee."
588,近日，英国政府突然宣布暂缓与中法合作的英国欣克利角核电站项目，引起海内外广泛关注。,"The UK government recently announced suddenly the suspension of the project of Hinkley Point Nuclear Power Station in the UK in partnership with China and France, attracting a wide spread attention at home and abroad."
589,日前，英国政府发言人表示，英方推迟该项目并不代表对中国的热情已经冷却，中英仍在一系列广泛领域进行合作，英国将继续寻求同中国维护强劲的关系。,"A UK government spokesman recently said that the deferral of the project does not mean the UK has chilled its enthusiasm for China, as China and the UK are still cooperating in a wide range of sectors and the UK will continue to seek to maintain the strong partnership with China."
590,专家指出，中国核电在技术水平、安全性能、运营经验等各方面均处于世界领先水平，且成本相对低廉。,"Some experts pointed out that China's nuclear power leads the world in technical level, safety performance, operating experience and all other aspects, as well as has relatively low costs."
591,因此，尽管“核电出海”会在一定时期内受到风浪考验，但在巨大共赢潜力下，各方互利合作的趋势不会改变。,"Therefore, although ""Nuclear Power Going Global"" will experience trials and tribulations in a given period, the trend of mutually beneficial cooperation between the parties will not be changed in the context of huge win-win potential."
592,而英国在欣克利角核电站项目上的表现显然难以用这句话来形容。,But these words clearly do not hold true for what the UK did in the project of Hinkley Point Nuclear Power Station.
593,项目建成后，将满足英国7%的电力需求；而在60年运行期内，每年将减排900万吨二氧化碳。,"Once the project is completed, it will meet 7 percent of the UK's power demands and help reduce 9 million tons of carbon dioxide annually in the operation period of 60 years."
594,分析人士普遍认为，英国自身经济风险暴露、国内政治分歧加大、脱欧后续程序繁琐、未来不确定性增大等复杂因素，共同构成了核电项目的阻碍。,"Analysts generally believe that complicated factors in the UK such as exposed economic risks, increasing disputes among domestic politics, cumbersome subsequent procedures after Brexit, and increasing future uncertainties all impede its nuclear power projects."
595,“目前英国房地产价格下跌、资金开始流出，稳定国内经济及市场体系成为了英国新政府的当务之急。,"""Currently, since property prices in the UK are falling and outflow of capital starts occurring, keeping domestic economy and market system stable has been the top priority of the UK's new government."
596,与此同时，脱欧公投通过后，英国接下来也要面对一系列脱欧程序，并重新理顺与法国等欧盟国家的关系。,"Meanwhile, after the approval of Brexit vote, the UK also needs to face a number of Brexit procedures in the coming days and straighten out its relationship with EU countries like France again."
597,徐明棋说，尽管英国新政府欲与前一届政府“相区别”的态度很明显，但并没有否定核电项目的积极意义。,"Xu Mingqi said that though the UK's new government shows apparent eagerness to ""differentiate from"" the previous government, it does not deny the positive significance of nuclear power projects."
598,但近20年来，英国的核电发展有所停滞，现有的15个核电站大多数已达到设计寿命。,"Over the past two decades, however, the UK has seen the stagnation of the development of its nuclear power, and a majority of its existing 15 nuclear power stations have reached their design lifetime."
599,据英国《能源白皮书》预测，到2025年英国将只有一个核电站仍在运行，届时电力供应将面临重大缺口。,"According to the prediction of the UK's Energy White Paper, there will be only one nuclear power station still in service in the UK by 2025, leading to major gaps in electric power supply."
600,正因如此，各方普遍对英国暂缓这一事关民众福祉的项目表示担忧。,"For this reason, the parties express their common concerns about the suspension of this project benefiting the public welfare by the UK government."
601,斯科勒尔认为，只要符合两国利益，中国可以为帮助英国重建基础设施发挥关键作用。,"In the view of Scuoler, where it is in the interests of the both countries, China can play a key role in helping the UK reconstructing infrastructures."
602,刘晓明表示，该项目只待顺利启动实施，早日为英国提供安全、可靠和可持续的能源。,"Liu Xiaoming said that we look forward to successfully starting and implementing the project as early as possible, providing the UK with safe, reliable and sustainable energy."
603,业内人士表示，核电站项目不仅有助于英国民众降低用电成本，而且将拉动当地经济、带动就业。,"According to insiders, projects of nuclear power stations are instrumental in the reduction of electricity cost for the British public, while at the same time driving local economy and employment."
604,因此，如果英国新政府最终从民众福祉最大化的角度来决策，那么核电项目的前景就不悲观。,"So, if the UK's new government makes a final decision from the prospective of maximizing its people's welfare, nuclear power projects will not see a gloomy outlook."
605,英方可以缓解能源需求缺口，中法双方则可以为自身在核电领域的优势技术及产品找到市场，造福更多民众。”,"The UK side can address energy demand gap, and the sides of both China and France can find the market for their own advantageous technologies and products in the field of nuclear power, benefiting more people."""
606,尽管欣克利角核电站项目的不确定性增加，但中国核电技术的高水平和成熟经验却是确定无疑的。,"In spite of the increasing uncertainty of the Hinkley Point Nuclear Power Station project, there is no doubt about China's high-level and sophisticated experience in nuclear power technology."
607,以按原计划将进入英国核电市场的中国“华龙一号”为例，其在设计上就融合了其他先进核电技术设计的优点并汲取了以往的经验。,"Taking China's ""Hualong 1"" that will enter the British nuclear power market as scheduled as an example, it incorporates the advantages of other advanced nuclear power technologies and drew previous experience in design."
608,例如，针对日本福岛核事故所反映出的问题，中国设计了“蒸汽发生器二次侧非能动余热排出”系统，能够将堆芯热量及时排出，从而避免堆芯熔毁的发生。,"For instance, China has designed the ""passive residual heat removal system at the secondary side of vapor generator"" based on problems reflected in Japan's Fukushima nuclear accident, which can remove the heat from reactor cores in time, avoiding the meltdown of reactor cores."
609,刘晓明表示，中国发展核电30多年来，一直保持着良好的运行业绩和安全水准，在核电发展和监管方面的成就得到了国际机构的高度评价。,"Liu Xiaoming said that China has been keeping a good track record and safety level during the development of nuclear power for more than 30 years, and international institutions set a high value on the achievements it has made in nuclear power development and regulatory."
610,当前中英关系正处在一个重要历史时刻，相互尊重和信任更显弥足珍贵。,"It is now an important historic moment for the relationship between China and the UK, so mutual respect and trust are more valuable than ever."
611,中方希望英国政府继续支持欣克利角核电站项目，尽早做出决定，确保项目顺利实施。,"The Chinese side hoped that the UK government continues to support the Hinkley Point Nuclear Power Station project, and makes a decision as early as possible to ensure the successful implementation of the project."
612,在中国国际贸易学会中美欧经济战略研究中心共同主席何伟文看来，留给英方作出决定的时间并不多，中英双方应采取必要的接触和沟通。,"In the opinion of He Weiwen, Co-chair of the Sino-America-Europe Economic Strategy Research Center, the China Association of International Trade (CAIT), since there is limited time for the British side to make the decision, the both parties need more substantive communications and dialogues."
613,“阿根廷换总统以后，中阿核电站项目也是暂被搁置，但经过积极推进，目前中阿核电站项目已经明确计划在明年一季度开工。”,"""Following the change of president of Argentina, the China-Argentina nuclear power station project was also laid aside temporarily, but it has now been clearly scheduled to begin construction in the first quarter of next year."""
614,今年入夏以来，我市气温高居不下，游泳成为不少市民纳凉消暑的好选择，而桂江水上游泳场则吸引了不少市民群众到此游泳、戏水。,"Since the onset of this summer, the temperature in our city is at an all-time high, so swimming has been a go-to choice for many citizens to enjoy the cool and relieve summer heat, particularly in the swimming pool in the Guijiang River which attracts a great number of citizens to come."
615,据游泳场的工作人员介绍，每天下午4时许陆续有大批市民或带着孩子来游泳，浅水池和中水池几乎挤满了人。,"According to the staff of the swimming pool, a myriad of citizens or people together with their child come here in succession from 4pm every day, and then the wading pool and middle pool are always jam-packed with people."
616,不少游泳爱好者都十分青睐这个景致优美且水域宽广的水上游泳场。,This beautiful and broad-waters swimming pool in the river is very popular with many swimmers.
617,第九届中国－东盟教育交流周自8月8日起正式进入持续期，并将举办70项贯穿全年的活动。,The 9th China-ASEAN Education Exchange Week will officially enter the extended period from August 8 and host 70 activities throughout the year.
618,在此前的开幕期阶段，来自中国及东盟10国的政府官员、大学校长、专家学者等，对教育发展计划进行了有效交流。,"In the previous opening period, government officials, presidents from colleges and universities, experts and scholars alike from China and 10 ASEAN countries conducted effective exchanges in plans for educational development."
619,"此外，值得注意的是，第二届“中国-东盟教育部长圆桌会议”也是既召开以来,11国教育部长时隔6年的再次聚首。","In addition, it is worth noting that the 2nd ""China-ASEAN Education Ministers Round Table"" brings together all the education ministers from the 11 countries for a second time six years later since the inception of China-ASEAN Education Exchange Week."
620,"今年是“中国-东盟教育交流年”,同时也是中国-东盟建立对话关系25周年。","This year marks the ""China-ASEAN Education Exchange Year"" and also is the 25th anniversary of the dialogue relationship established between China and ASEAN."
621,近年来，中国与东盟国家各领域交流合作日益深化，在教育方面的合作不断推出亮点。,"In recent years, China and ASEAN countries has been increasingly deepening exchanges and cooperation in all domains, and constantly launched highlights in educational cooperation."
622,据了解，在双方连续多年举办的教育交流周活动中，签署了近800份合作协议，在人文交流中不断实现合作共赢。,"It is understood that, during the education exchange Week held by the two parties for years in a row, nearly 800 cooperation agreements were signed, continuously enabling win-win cooperation in people-to-people exchange."
623,而本次交流年中，第九届中国—东盟教育交流周、第二届中国—东盟教育部长圆桌会议作为教育年的旗舰项目，尤为引人关注。,"In this exchange year, as flagship programs of the Education Year, the 9th China-ASEAN Education Exchange Week and the 2nd China-ASEAN Education Ministers Round Table were of particular concern."
624,并且为“中国—东盟清镇职教中心”、“中国—东盟轨道交通教育培训联盟”举行了揭牌仪式。,"And, ""China-ASEAN Qingzhen Vocational Education Center"" and ""China-ASEAN Rail Transit Education and Training Alliance"" were inaugurated as well."
625,连续举办的“中国-东盟教育交流年”，为“中国-东盟命运共同体”的构建，增添了更为紧密的区域教育合作目标。,"The ""China-ASEAN Education Exchange Year"" that has been held for years running provides a goal of closer regional education cooperation for building the ""China-ASEAN Community of Shared Future""."
626,"“中国-东盟教育交流周,为深化双方人文交流,架设‘心灵之桥、友谊之桥、理解之桥’发挥了不可替代的作用。”","""The China-ASEAN Education Exchange Week plays an irreplaceable role in deepening human-oriented exchange between the two parties and erecting the ""Bridge of Soul, Bridge of Friendship, Bridge of Understanding."""
627,如今，人们对肿瘤的关注度急剧提升，这可能与近年来癌症发病率居高不下有极大关系。,"Today, the attention paid by people to tumors is increasing rapidly, which in a large part might be linked to cancer incidence at a high level in recent years."
628,据2012年癌症有关报告显示，我国每年新发癌症病例约337万，死亡约211万。,"According to reports about cancer in 2012, there were about 3.37 million new cancer cases and some 2.11 million death cases in China every year."
629,癌症已成为我国死亡第一大原因，死亡人数占全球癌症死亡人数四分之一。,"Cancer has been the No.1 cause of death in China, with the death toll accounting for one quarter of the global death toll due to cancer."
630,癌症就是细胞不受控制的增长和扩散，它可以影响人体的几乎任何部分。,"Due to its uncontrolled growth and proliferation, caner can affect nearly every part of human body."
631,通俗地说，身体的任何部位都可能长肿瘤，有的肿瘤还会转移到身体的其他部位。,"Generally speaking, any part of human body might suffer from cancer, and some kinds of cancers will also be transferred to other part of the body."
632,癌症是一种基因疾病，但研究发现，只有一小部分癌症是遗传的。,"Cancer is a genetic disease, but studies found that only a small number of cancers are genetic."
633,很多因素影响癌症的发生发展，其中环境因素最为重要，而且是可以改变的。,"Many factors can affect the occurrence and development of cancers, among which environmental factors are on top of the list and can be changed."
634,环境因素包括吸烟、传染因子、辐射、污染，以及食物、营养、身体活动等。,"Environmental factors include smoking, infectious factors, radiation, pollution as well as foods, nutrition, and physical activities, etc."
635,送到医院，医生告诉家属，李大爷是因为腹泻引起的严重脱水，导致高渗性昏迷，情况十分危急，再晚送来几分钟可能就没命了。,"After Mr. Li was sent to the hospital, the doctor told his family members that he was in a serious situation because he was in a hyperosmolar coma caused by severe dehydration as a result of diarrhea, and he might die if sent here a few minutes later."
636,据统计，大约有20%的糖尿病患者可能出现腹泻的症状，多见于未经治疗或血糖控制不好的患者。,"According to statistics, the symptom of diarrhea might be found in some 20% of diabetics, particularly previously untreated patients or those whose blood glucose has not been controlled properly."
637,部分糖尿病患者甚至以慢性腹泻为首发症状，迷惑性很强，造成漏诊和误诊。,"For some diabetics, chronic diarrhea might even the primary disease symptom, which is so deceptive and then leads to missed diagnosis and misdiagnose."
638,消化不良引起的腹泻，会厌食、恶心，吃助消化药病情会好转；细菌性腹泻一般发病很急，一天数次，有腹痛感，短时治疗基本能痊愈。,"Diarrhea in the wake of dyspepsia can lead to anorexia and nausea, and taking digestives can help the illness take a turn for a better way; for bacterial diarrhea, the disease generally comes in suddenly and several times a day, accompanying with the feeling of abdominal pain, but it can get recovery after a short-term treatment."
639,而糖尿病性腹泻，多表现为顽固性腹泻，无明显腹痛、化验大便多不伴感染，但腹泻次数明显较多，最多可达每天20多次。,"And for diabetic diarrhea, it is mostly expressed in refractory diarrhea without obvious abdominal pain and with assayed excrements that do not accompany infection in most cases, but the number of diarrhea is significantly increased, up to 20-plus times a day."
640,此外，某些降糖药譬如刚开始服二甲双胍或α葡萄糖苷酶抑制剂等降糖药时，也可能出现腹胀、腹痛、腹泻等副作用。,"Additionally, when some hypoglycemic drugs such as melbine (DMBG) or α-glucosidase inhibitor are taken at very onset, patients might happen to side effects like abdominal distension, abdominal pain and diarrhea."
641,这是因为，腹泻之后，如果有炎症，可能出现应激性高血糖，而拉完肚子又会出现低血糖的状况。,This is because stress hyperglycemia together with hypoglycemia condition might occur after diarrhea in case of inflammation.
642,并且，由于腹泻使人体处于应激状态，释放多种激素，在对抗腹泻的同时，还额外动员出很多血糖，严重时还可能引起酮症酸中毒。,"Moreover, human body is in a stress situation due to diarrhea, releasing multiple hormones. While its confrontation with diarrhea, human body will also suffer from much blood glucose that outflows, which might cause ketoacidosis in severe cases."
643,因此，糖友出现腹泻后，除了就医针对病因治疗以外，还应注意以下几点。,"Therefore, in addition to etiological treatment in hospital, diabetics should also pay attention to the following aspects after diarrhea."
644,发生急性腹泻的糖尿病患者首先必须防止脱水，所以务必要多喝水，多喝水自然会多排尿，既有助于排出多余的血糖，也有利于排出酮体。,"Diabetics suffering from acute diarrhea must prevent dehydration first, so it is necessary to drink more water, which naturally helps them with more urination, allowing for draining unnecessary blood glucose as well as acetone bodies."
645,但不要喝含咖啡因的饮料，因为咖啡因会刺激肠胃蠕动加重腹泻。,"However, it is best not to have drinks containing caffeine because caffeine can stimulate gastrointestinal motility and then aggravate diarrhea."
646,糖尿病患者急性腹泻时血糖调节失衡，务必密切观察血糖变化，最好每隔3～4个小时测一次血糖。,"For diabetics, blood glucose regulation will be out of balance in case of acute diarrhea, so they must closely observe the changes of blood glucose. It is best to measure blood glucose every 3 to 4 hours."
647,美国食品和药物管理局日前批准在东南部的佛罗里达州开展转基因蚊子野外试验。,The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved field tests of genetically altered mosquitoes to be conducted in Florida in the southeast of the United States.
648,这种转基因蚊子可帮助控制寨卡病毒、登革热与基孔肯雅热等蚊媒传染病的传播。,"This kind of genetically altered mosquito can help control the transmission of mosquito-borne infectious diseases such as Zika, Dengue fever and Chikungunya fever."
649,美药管局今年3月公布的初步环境评估报告也认为，这种蚊子不会显著影响环境。,"According to a preliminary environmental assessment report released by the FDA in March, this kind of mosquito will not significantly affect the environment."
650,但报告也指出，这不等于批准这种转基因蚊子可以用于商业用途。,"The report also noted that, however, this did not mean this kind of mosquito can be used for commercial purpose."
651,牛津昆虫技术公司还必须遵守联邦、州和地方政府的其他规定，并与其当地合作伙伴佛罗里达群岛蚊虫控制区一同决定开展野外试验的时间。,"Oxitec also must follow other regulations specified by the federal, state and local governments, and work together with its local partner Florida Keys Mosquito Control District to determine the time of conducting field tests."
652,在巴西、巴拿马及开曼群岛开展的试验显示，这种转基因蚊子可使试验区的蚊子数量减少超过90％。,"Tests conducted in Brazil, Panama and Cayman Islands showed that this kind of mosquito can reduce the number of mosquitoes in test areas by more than 90%."
653,利用转基因技术“以蚊灭蚊”也有争议，一些专家认为这会对环境产生未知影响。,"There are also controversies about utilizing transgenic technology to ""eliminate mosquitoes with mosquitoes"", among which some experts believed that this will bring unknown influence to environment."
654,此外，安徽省建立重点药品监控目录预警管理制度，定期公布价格高、用量大、非治疗辅助性药品监控目录并进行通报。,"In addition, Anhui province has established the Major Medicines Monitoring Directory Warning Management System, periodically publishing monitoring directories of high-price, large-consumption and non-treatment adjuvant drugs and making them public."
655,8月4日，参赛队员在赛场上进行了400米障碍、95-1式自动步枪对不动目标射击、负重深蹲起等四项比赛的角逐。,"On August 4, players competed for four items including 400-meter steeplechase, fixed target shooting with 95-1 automatic rifle, and squat thrust in the ground track field."
656,此次比武为检验部队综合能力，竞赛队伍分为机动组、船艇组、后勤组。,"The demonstration of and competition in military skills aimed to test comprehensive capacities of armed forces, with competition teams including mobility group, ships and boats group, and logistics group."
657,船艇组进行了专业的驾驶、枪帆、机电竞赛；后勤组进行后勤补给、装备拆解排除隐患等项目的比拼。,"The ships and boats group participated in professional driving, gunman and seaman affair, and electromechanical competitions; the logistics group competed for items including logistic supply, equipment dismantling and troubleshooting."
658,报告预测，近三分之二在校生未来从事的工作是现在尚未出现的，而与虚拟现实设计、机器人工程学、视觉传播有关的职业都将在未来职场占据一席之地。,"The report predicts that the work types in which two-thirds of students at school will be engaged in the future have not appeared yet now, but those majoring in virtual reality design, robot engineering and visual communication alike will occupy a position in the future job market."
659,国际体育记者协会8日在里约向报道过10届以上奥运会的资深体育记者颁奖，对他们为奥林匹克运动和体育报道作出的贡献表示感谢。,"The International Sports Press Association (AIPS) presented an award to senior sports journalists who have covered more than 10 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro on August 8, acknowledging their contributions to the coverage of Olympic Games and sports."
660,国际体育记协共向100多位体育记者颁奖，其中，报道奥运次数最多的为意大利记者朱利亚诺·贝维拉夸，共报道过25届奥运会（夏季与冬季）。,"The AIPS awarded a total of more than 100 sports journalists, among which the Italian journalist Giuliano Bevilacqua covers 25 Olympic Games (including summer and winter versions) in all, No.1 in the number of reports."
661,这是国际体育记者协会连续第三次在奥运期间向奥运记者老兵颁奖，前两次是在2012年伦敦奥运会和2014年索契冬奥会。,"This was the third consecutive time for the AIPS to award veteran Olympic reporters during the Olympic Games, following the 2012 London Games and the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi."
662,比如伦敦奥运时流行汉语“你好”的问候、里约奥运时菲尔普斯为拔火罐“代言”，“中国影响力”与日俱增。,"""Chinese influence"" is increasingly with each passing day, exemplified by the greeting with Chinese ""Ni Hao (hello)""that was popular during the London Olympic Games and cupping therapy ""endorsed"" by Michael Phelps during the Rio Olympics."
663,奥运流行“中国风”，折射中国日益增强的综合实力和国际影响力。,"The prevalence of ""Chinese style"" during Olympic Games reflects China's increasingly improved comprehensive strength and international influence."
664,湖北当阳市马店矸石发电有限责任公司11日15时20分发生爆管事故，已确认死亡21人、受伤5人，其中3人重伤。,"At 15:20 p.m. on August 11, Hubei Dangyang Madian Coal Gangue Power Generation Co., Ltd. had a pipe bursting accident, in which 21 people were confirmed dead and 5 people were injured, including 3 seriously injured."
665,一条巨蟒成功拿下了一头小羚羊，但在试图吞食猎物时，不幸被小羚羊的羚角给刺穿了。,"A python succeeded in capturing a gazelle, but its throat was impaled by the gazelle's horn as it attempted to swallow the prey."
666,62岁的摄影师Christo Brunette拍摄下了这极为罕见的画面。,This is an extremely rare picture took by the 62-year-old photographer Christo Brunette.
667,10日下午，在美国纽约一名男子携带吸盘和登山工具沿特朗普大厦外墙攀爬，在这片繁华地段引来了不少民众围观。,"On the afternoon of August 10, a man with a suction cup and climbing gear climbed up the exterior wall of Trump Building in New York, the US, attracting tons of spectators in this bustling block."
668,今年上海书展上，不少重点图书是长征胜利80周年、中国共产党建党95周年、供给侧改革、一带一路等选题，主题出版物在叫好的同时能否叫座？,"At this year's Shanghai Bookfair, the focus of numerous important books is on themes such as the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Long March, the 95th anniversary of the communist party of China, supply-side reform and the Belt and Road. So, will these theme publications be both critically acclaimed and hot-selling?"
669,上海世纪出版集团副总裁李远涛认为，一本书的目标是既要有社会效益又要有经济效益，最好二者能统一。,"Li Yuantao, Vice President of Shanghai Century Publishing Group, believed that the goal of a book is to gain either social benefit or economic benefits, but with the combination of the two at its best."
670,这5000余种图书的推荐者均为各学科领域的名家学者、各大出版机构的掌门人以及全国各地具有影响力的主流媒体。,"Presenters of the more than 5,000 books are all famous experts and scholars in each subject area, heads of each major publishing agency or influential mainstream media across the country."
671,除了在“社科精品馆”进行集中陈列展示，这些书的推荐内容介绍将出现在“上海书展云会场”微信平台上。,"Along with a unified showcase and exhibition in the ""Social Sciences Boutique Pavilion"", the recommended content of these books will also be present on the WeChat platform of ""Cloud Venue of Shanghai Bookfair""."

676,所幸好心路人发现，不断向货车司机大喊示意，并驾车将货车逼停后，才让男子逃过一劫。,"Fortunately, a good-hearted passerby found that. Then, he continuously shouted at the truck driver, and drove his car to overtake the truck and forced it to stop, helping the man be off the hook."
677,该名好心的路人叫杨东（化名），他的行车记录仪拍下了惊险的一幕。,"The good-hearted passerby is called Yang Dong (assumed name), and his automobile data recorder shot the breathtaking scene."
678,视频资料显示，事发当日18时14分许，杨东驾车路过事发路段，突然一名中年男子骑自行车从一大货车的后侧方钻出来。,"The video data showed that, at about 18:14 on the day of the incident, Yang Dong driving his car passed by the incident road section, and a middle-aged man on a bike came out of the roadside of the rear of the truck all of a sudden."
679,当大货车正欲左转弯时，直接将该男子撞倒，迅速将其卷入货车底部。,When the truck driver was getting ready to turn the truck to the left and directly ran down the man who was quickly pulled under the bottom of the truck.
680,然而，此时大货车司机一脸茫然，没明白杨东的意思，准备继续驾车前行。,"However, at that time the truck driver looked at Yang Dong with a blank expression, and did not know what he meant, but got ready to continue to drive forward."
681,在此紧急时刻，杨东立即打开自己的车窗，大声朝货车司机喊：“你车下有人，快点停车。”,"In such emergency, Yang Dong promptly pulled down his car window, shouting loudly at the truck driver, ""There is someone under your truck, stop it right now!"""
682,说罢，他驾车快速驶至大货车的正前方，拦住其去路，逼停大货车。,"Just then, he drove his car fast to overtake the truck and got in the way to stop it."
683,随后，男子从车底爬出来，站起身，经初步检查仅膝盖被蹭破了皮，其余部位没有出现明显伤痕。,"Afterwards, the man crawled out from under the truck and stood up. After preliminary checkup, he just suffered from broken skin on his knees and there were no open wounds on other areas of his body."
684,次日，为警告司机驾车时应注意车下方的情况，他将该段行车记录传到网上，不少网友纷纷为他的行为点赞。,"The next day, he uploaded the driving video onto the Internet to remind drivers that they should pay attention to the condition under their car during driving, and many netizens gave a thumbs-up to his practice."
685,据悉，史蒂夫是一名平面设计师，长相酷似荷兰画家梵高，最大的不同之处是他没有失去双耳。,"It is said that Steve is a graphic designer who is the very image of Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh, from whom the biggest difference is that he has intact ears."
686,之前史蒂夫和身边的人并没有注意到这一点，但是自从1个月前史蒂夫留起胡须后，他身边的同事才跟他提起这件事。,"Previously, Steve and people around him did not notice this aspect, but his fellows mentioned it after Steve grew his beards one month ago."
687,史蒂夫的朋友发给他一个链接，鼓励他申请参加世界上最像梵高的人的比赛。,One of Steve's friends sent a link to him and encouraged him to apply for partaking in the competition of the man who is like Vincent van Gogh most.

694,瑞典保险公司My Safety总裁指出，身份盗窃案件高发的原因之一是人们在使用个人信息时不谨慎，使犯罪分子有空子可钻。,"The president of My Safety, a Sweden insurance company, pointed out that one reason of the high frequency of criminal cases of identity theft was that people are incautious when using personal information, allowing criminals to take advantage of loopholes."

770,其实，这些皮肤病的起因也大同小异，都是因为小朋友不够“清爽”，汗水、口水流得多，又不及时擦干，“捂”出了皮肤病。,"As a matter of fact, the causes of these skin diseases are also quite similar, that is, little kids are not that ""clean"" due to too much sweat and saliva that but is not removed in time, so that the ""covered"" skin happens to diseases."
771,谭小华医师指出，与成人相比，小朋友的皮肤比较娇嫩，产热多汗水多。,Podiatrist Tan Xiaohua noted that little kids have much more delicate skin as well as more heat production and sweat than adults.

777,此外，预防夏季皮肤病，可以在宝宝洗澡水中滴入一些中草药成分的防痱药水，这类药水有金银花等成分，能帮助毛孔疏散，有助于排汗。,"In addition, to prevent skin diseases in summer, anti-miliaria potion containing some herb ingredients like honeysuckle can be dripped into the bath water for babies, which can help disperse pore and perspire."
778,以上为保护宝宝皮肤家长要做的基本功课，针对不同的皮肤病，家长也可以采取下列不同的处理方法。,"The above are essentials for parents to protect their kid's skin. For different skin diseases, parents can also adopt the following different treatment methods."
779,但需要提醒大家的是，如果红疹出现了脓点，或者反反复复发作，这时建议就医处理，排查是否有其他疾病的可能性。,"But keep in mind that if red rashes are accompanied with patches or repeatedly attack, it is recommended to see a doctor to check the possibility of other diseases."

782,如果学生有问题，可先打给就读的学校；如果问题得不到有效解决，再打相关省市直至教育部热线电话。,"If students have questions, they can call the school in which they study first; if it doesn't work, they can dial the hotline set by relevant municipality or province and even the Ministry of Education."

Meanwhile, pictures of her smoking in the past were made public again, and even a startling inside story that she smokes a minimum of 40 cigarettes every day was disclosed."
784,现在眼看荣仓奈奈已经升格人妻，有不少网友认为虽然她是成年人、不用为抽烟负法律责任，但应该还是要尽快戒烟，否则会对日后怀孕有不好的影响。,"Now, since Eikura Nana has just been married, many netizens believe that although she is now a grown woman who is not held liable for smoking, she had better quite smoking as soon as possible, or this will have a negative influence on her pregnancy in the future."
785,记者12日从北京市预警中心获悉，密云区及房山区、平谷区当日相继发布暴雨红色和橙色预警信号。,"On August 12, the reporter learned from the Beijing Warning Center that Miyun District, Fangshan District and Pinggu District issued rainstorm red and orange warning signals in succession that day."
786,来自密云区委宣传部的消息称，密云区目前已关闭34家旅游自然风景区，北庄镇大岭村一漫水桥被冲毁。,"According to the Propaganda Department of the Miyun District Committee, Miyun District currently has shut down 34 tourism scenic spots and a submersible bridge in Daling Village, Beizhuang Town, has been destroyed."
787,12日10时，密云区发布暴雨红色预警和地质灾害橙色预警，14时30分解除暴雨红色预警信号。,"At 10 am, August 12, Miyun District issued a rainstorm red warning signal and a geological disaster orange warning signal. And the rainstorm red warning signal was lifted at 2:30 pm."
788,预计当日傍晚到夜间，密云区仍有雷阵雨或阵雨，山区及浅山区出现强降雨诱发的中小河流洪水、山洪、地质灾害等次生灾害的风险高。,"It is estimated that there is still a thundershower or shower in Miyun District from the late afternoon to night that day, and mountainous areas and shallow mountainous areas will be at high risks of small and medium-sized river floods, mountain torrents, geological disaster and other secondary disasters arising from heavy rainfall."
789,目前，密云区镇村三级共投入8100人进入防汛一线，已转移164个村、2742人到安置点，全区各民俗村不再接待游客。,"Recently, Miyun District has dispatched 8,100 persons to be involved in the front line of flood prevention at district, town and village levels, and has evacuated 2,742 villagers across 164 villages to temporary shelters. The folk customs villages across the district stopped receiving tourists."
790,此外，平谷区气象台12日12时50分升级发布暴雨橙色预警信号，房山区气象台12日14时20分升级发布暴雨橙色预警信号。,"Additionally, the Pinggu District observatory issued an upgraded rainstorm orange warning signal at 12:50, August 12, and the Fangshan District observatory issued an upgraded rainstorm orange warning signal at 2:20 pm that day."
791,预计到傍晚，房山区强降雨仍将持续，山区及浅山区有地质灾害风险。,It is estimated that Fangshan District will still see a sustained rainfall and there will be geological disaster risks in mountainous areas and shallow mountainous areas.
792,另据北京市预警中心消息，12日6时至14时，全市雨量监测站平均降水量20毫米，城区平均13.7毫米。,"And according to the Beijing Warning Center, an average precipitation measured by the rainfall monitoring stations across the city reached 20mm, with 13.7mm for urban area, from 6:00 am to 2:00 pm on August 12."
793,据了解，事发时共有20多人在内作业，进行热能调试工作时发生了蒸汽管破裂。,"It is learned that at the time of the steam pipe break accident, more than 20 persons were working on thermal energy debugging on site."
794,截至12日凌晨三点半，伤者仍在当阳市人民医院重症监护室进行抢救。,"Up to 3:30 am on the morning of August 12, the wounded persons were still in the ICU of Dangyang People's Hospital for emergency treatment."
795,伤者罗文的家属冯先生表示，伤者除了头发和脚以外，90%的都烫伤了。,"Mr. Feng, a family member of the wounded person Luo Wen, said that 90% of his body has been scalded except hair and feet."
796,由于伤势严重，冯先生见到罗文的时候，他的意识已经不太清醒，医生正对他进行抢救。,"When Mr. Feng saw Luo Wen, he was unconscious due to serious injuries and doctors were saving his life."
797,据了解，受伤的5位工人都为烫伤，其中还有部分伤员伴有骨折等伤情。,"It is understood that the five injured workers all suffer from scalding, some of whom are accompanied with injuries such as fracture."
798,接到事故报告后，国家安全监管总局派出工作组赶赴事故现场，指导协助当地全力做好现场救援和事故处理工作。,"Upon receipt of the accident report, the State Administration of Work Safety immediately dispatched a working group to rush to the scene of the accident, guiding and assisting local forces to make great efforts to carry out on-site rescue and accident handling."
799,湖北省委省政府主要领导带领湖北省安监局也在事发后，赶到现场指挥救援。,"Major leaders of the CPC Hubei Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government, together with leaders from the Hubei Provincial Safety Production Supervision Authority, also arrived on the scene to direct rescue operations after the accident."
800,据这名官员指出，超过1.77万人已经被正式拘留，超过1.15万人已经被释放，还有超过5.6千人被扣押。,"According to the official, more than 17,700 people have been formally under arrest, over 11,500 people have been released, and more than 5,600 other people have been in custody."
801,据了解，当地时间7月16日晚，土耳其反叛组织企图进行军事政变。,It is learned that Turkey's rebel group attempted to launch a military coup on the evening of July 16 (local time).
802,土耳其政府指控反对派传教士葛兰策划了未遂政变，要求美国将其引渡。,The Turkish Government accused the opposition faction missionary Gulen of plotting an abortive coup attempt and requested the US to extradite him to Turkey.
803,土耳其司法部长贝基尔·博兹达后来表示，该国政府再次向美国提出引渡请求。,Turkey's Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said later that his government has made a second request for extradition of Gulen to the US.
804,法新社称，从11日晚间至12日上午，除了华欣发生的4次爆炸以外，还有2次爆炸发生在普吉岛，1次在素叻他尼，1次在南董里。,"From the evening of August 11 to the morning of August 12, there were 2 explosions on Phuket Island, 1 in Surat Thani and 1 in the south of Trang other than 4 in Hua Hin, Agence France Presse said."
805,据此前报道，当地时间11日晚10点，第一枚炸弹爆炸，无人受伤。,"It was previously reported that the first bomb exploded at local time 10 pm, August 11, but no one was injured."
806,第二枚炸弹爆炸造成1名泰国女子丧生，多名外国人和泰国人受伤。,The explosion of the second bomb killed one Thai woman and hurt several foreigners and Thai people.
807,据当地警方说，“伤者中有3人伤势严重，其中有7名外国人，包括4女3男。”,"""Among the wounded persons there are 3 seriously injured persons and 7 foreigners including 4 women and 3 men,"" said local police."
808,事发后，泰国警方对爆炸地点附近的民众和游客进行了疏散，伤者被送往当地医院。,"After the accident, the Thai police evacuated the public and visitors near the explosion sites and sent the wounded persons to local hospitals."
809,目前，泰国警方正在调查爆炸案的背后动机，以及使用的是何种炸弹。,"At present, the Thai police are investigating the motivation behind the explosion cases and what kind of bomb has been used."
810,华欣是位于泰国班武里府的一个著名海滨旅游城市，吸引许多本国和外国观光客。,"As a renowned seashore tourism city in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province, Thailand, Hua Hin attracts tons of domestic and foreign visitors every year."
811,该市位于曼谷南方约200公里，是泰国皇室的避暑渡假胜地，境内拥有数个美丽海滩、国家公园，历史遗迹公园和皇室遗址。,"Located about 200 kilometers away from the south of Bangkok, the city is a summer resort for the Thai royal household, where there are a number of beautiful beaches, national parks, historic sites and ruins of royal household."
812,世界卫生组织8月12日表示，前往巴西观看2016里约奥运会和残奥会而导致寨卡病毒感染或传播的风险不高。,"On August 12, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that the risk for visitors, who go to Brazil to watch the 2016 Rio Olympic Games and Rio Paralympic Games, to suffer from Zika virus infection or transmission is not high."
813,运动员和旅行者若前往巴西，可采取预防措施，避开寨卡病毒两大传播途径：蚊子叮咬和性传播。,"If athletes and travelers have to go to Brazil, preventive measures can be taken to avoid two ways of Zika virus transmission: mosquito bites and sexual transmission."
814,截至8月10日，66个国家和地区已经报告了2015年以来蚊媒寨卡病毒传播的证据。,"As of August 10, 66 countries and regions have reported the evidence of the mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission since 2015."
815,部分国家或某些国家的部分地区报告寨卡病毒感染案例数量下降，但根据现阶段获得的证据来看，寨卡暴发整体并未显出下降迹象。,"Some countries or regions reported the decreased number of Zika virus infection cases, but the outbreak of Zika has not shown a declining trend in general according to the evidences obtained at the present stage."
816,世界卫生组织称，中国大陆虽已有寨卡病毒病例输入，但是尚未发现存在从蚊子到人的本地传染。,"The WHO stated that although there have been Zika virus cases imported from overseas to the Chinese mainland, no local cases of human infected by mosquitoes have been found."
817,菲律宾总统杜特尔特12日说，他骂了美国驻菲大使菲利普·戈德堡，但不会向戈德堡道歉。,"On August 12, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said that although he abused Philip Goldberg, U.S. ambassador to the Philippines, he would not make an apology to Goldberg."
818,美国驻菲律宾大使馆12日发表声明说，美国方面注意到了有关批评戈德格的报道，这些批评的言论是“不合适的，不可接受的”。,"On August 12, the U.S. embassy in the Philippines said in a statement that the US side has noticed the reports about the criticism on Goldberg and these remarks were ""inappropriate and unacceptable""."
819,今年4月，在菲律宾总统选举竞选期间，戈德堡曾就人权问题指责杜特尔特，双方随后连续发声，言语冲突激烈。,"During the election campaign of president of the Philippines this April, Goldberg criticized Duterte on the issue of human rights, and the two continued to accuse each other with sharp speech conflicts later on."
820,北京时间8月12日，西班牙男篮好不容易才以96-87击败了尼日利亚，看到了一丝出线的希望。,"On August 12 Beijing Time, the Spanish men's basketball team saw a glimmer of hope of reaching the next phase after a tough 96-87 victory over Nigeria."
821,奥古奇三分球12投7中，两分球则没有出手，三次罚球全部命中，拿下了24分，阿科侬12分5个篮板，伊贝克维11分5个篮板。,"Oguchi got 24 points, including 7 of 12 three-pointers and all the 3 free throws made but no scores from the field, Akognon contributed 12 points and 5 rebounds, and Ibekwe scored 11 points and 5 rebounds."
822,作为传统欧洲强队，西班牙因为大将马克-加索尔缺阵，实力大损，被逼入了困境，甚至要从小组出线都不容易。,"As a traditional European team, Spain was severely weakened by the absence of its star player Marc Gasol, which had it on the ropes and even made it hard to advance from the group."
823,面对本组最弱的对手尼日利亚，西班牙也打得非常艰难，在最后时刻才勉强过关。,"Facing the weakest competitor Nigeria in the group, Spain also played very hard and scraped through the game at the eleventh hour."
824,本节最后1分20秒，尼日利亚又未能得分，罗德里格斯投中一记三分，西班牙连得5分后，以25-11领先。,"Within the last 1 minute 20 seconds in this quarter, Nigeria failed to score again, and Rodriguez hit a three-pointer to help Spain take a 25-11 lead into the first-quarter break after 5 straight points."
825,第二节还有3分54秒时，加索尔上篮得手，西班牙仍以40-27领先。,"When there were 3'54'' to go in the second quarter, Gasol made a driving layup to help Spain hold the lead at 40-27."
826,本节还有6分09秒时，卢尔两罚两中，西班牙以61-48重新取得两位数的优势。,"When there were 6'09'' left in this quarter, Llull hit two free throws for a 61-48 Spain lead, a two-digit advantage once again."
827,奥古奇还以一记三分后，西班牙连得4分，将优势扩大到14分。,"After Oguchi's three-pointer for Nigeria, Spain scored 4 straight points to extend its lead to 14."
828,不过在本节最后4分49秒，西班牙未能再得分，尼日利亚内外开花，以一波13-0结束本节，一举以66-65超出，这是他们全场首次领先。,"However, within the last 4 minutes 49 seconds in this quarter, Spain stopped scoring. On the contrary, Nigeria ended this quarter with a wave of 13-0 including points in the paint and outside shots for a 66-65 lead, the first in the whole game."
829,尼日利亚在这波攻击中两度命中三分，还有一记三分线外造成犯规。,"In this wave of attacks, Nigeria hit two three-pointers and a foul outside the three-pointer line."
830,比赛还有3分49秒时，阿米努上篮得手后，尼日利亚将比分追成了79-81。,"When the game came to the last 3'49'', Nigeria closed to 79-81 after Aminu added a layup."
831,奥古奇命中三分，尼日利亚又将差距缩小到1分后，雷耶斯和加索尔靠罚球连得6分，在比赛还有1分15秒时，以89-82领先。,"After Oguchi's another three-pointer helped Nigeria reduce the score disparity to 1, Reyes and Gasol who scored 6 straight points with free throws gave Spain an 89-82 lead as there were 1'15'' to go."
832,北京时间8月12日晚进行的中超联赛第22轮赛事中，北京国安主场1-2负于重庆力帆。,"On the evening of August 12 Beijing Time, Beijing Guoan lost 1-2 to Chongqing Lifan at home in the 22nd round of the Chinese Super League."
833,在场边进行片刻调整后，于大宝一度回场，但麻烦并没有真正解除，他因无法坚持还是在第76分钟被宋博轩换下。,"After a short-term adjustment courtside, Yu Dabao returned to the pitch, but his trouble hasn't been cleared up. So, he was substituted by Song Boxuan in the 76th minute due to his inability to hold on later in the game."
834,更令人揪心的是：于大宝已无法移动，他是被担架抬下的，在场边就地治疗了近10分钟，此后被直接送上了急救车。,"What is more, Yu Dabao could not move by himself and was stretchered off. After a 10-minute treatment courtside, he was directly sent into an emergency ambulance."
835,而说到“国脚”二字，于大宝如果受伤就必将影响国足在半个月后就将迎来的12强赛。,"As far as the ""national football squad"" is concerned, the possible injury of Yu Dabao will certainly affect China's competition for the Russia 2018 Asian Qualifiers that will kick off half a month later."
836,本周中国安客场0-0战平恒大的补赛中，于大宝就出现过伤情，他与保利尼奥在激烈拼抢中双双摔翻，导致脖子受伤。,"In a postponed Chinese Super League game held in this midweek, in which Guoan was held to a 0-0 draw by Evergrande away from home, Yu Dabao's neck has been injured after a fierce fight for a ball against José Paulo Bezerra Maciel Júnior, both of whom fell over at that time."
837,那场比赛中于汉超出现的严重伤情更是牵动人心，保守估计需要4个月恢复期，也就是说于汉超至少将缺席12强赛上半程的赛事。,"Also in that game, Yu Hanchao's serious injury made people more anxious. According to a conservative estimation, he needs a four-month recovery period, that is, he will at least miss the first half of the games for the top 12 Chinese football teams."
838,如果于大宝的伤情也较为麻烦，国足前场人选的配置将受到极大影响。,"If Yu Dabao's injury is serious, the front-field staffing of China's national football squad will be greatly affected."
839,不过，加州大学伯克利分校的工程师们将这个概念更推进了一步，开发出了极小的无线传感器用以检测人体内的健康状况。,"However, engineers from University of California, Berkeley, have advanced this concept and developed a tiny wireless sensor that can be used to monitor the health condition inside human body."
840,研究人员们在八月三日出版的《神经元》杂志上阐述了他们的发明。,The researchers introduced their invention on the Neuron published on August 3.
841,不仅如此，这些传感器不仅并不需要使用电池而且可以用来刺激神经和肌肉。,"On top of that, these battery-free sensors can be used to stimulate nerve and muscle."
842,这将可能提供一种治疗如癫痫等失调疾病或激活人体免疫系统的途径。,This will probably offer a way to treat disorders such as epilepsy or activate human immune system.
843,这个器件已被植入了大鼠的肌肉和末梢神经里，并采用超声来作为能量来源并读取收集到的数据。,"This device has been implanted into the muscle and peripheral nerve of rats, and uses ultrasound as energy source, which is also used to read collected data."
844,传感器已被缩小至一立方毫米，被称作“神经灰尘”，其中包含有一个压电晶体。,"This sensor has been compressed to 1 mm3, called ""Neural Dust"" which includes a piezo-electric crystal."
845,这篇论文的作者解释说，这个晶体将人体外发射的超声震动转化为电力，用以驱动器件内一个微小的晶体管，而这个晶体管直接连在一根神经或肌肉纤维上。,"The author of this paper explained that the crystal converts the vibration of ultrasound emitted outside the human body into electricity to drive a tiny transistor, which is directly attached to a nerve or muscle fibers, inside the device."
846,纤维内的电压峰值引起电流回路和晶体震动的改变，这样使超声接收器（目前主要还是发出超声震动的源头）探测到的回声。,"Voltage peak in fibers causes changes of current circuit and crystal vibration, so that ultrasonic receiver (which currently is still the source that sends ultrasonic vibration) can detect echo."
847,既然超声科技在医院里非常普遍，并且超声震动可以穿透绝大部分的躯体，它看起来像是个自然而然的选择。,"Now that ultrasonic technology is very common in hospitals and ultrasonic vibration can penetrate most parts of human body, it seems to be a natural choice."
848,Michel Maharbiz是加州大学伯克利分校电子工程及计算机科学的副教授。,"Michael Maharbiz is an associate professor of electronic engineering and computer science at University of California, Berkeley."
849,作为论文的共同通讯作者，他在一份声明中说，“我认为神经灰尘的长远前景并不局限在神经和大脑中，而要广阔得多。”,"As the co-corresponding author of the paper, he said in a statement, ""I believe that the long-term prospect of neural dust is not restricted to nerve and brain, but much broader."""
850,Maharbiz和同事及加州大学伯克利分校的神经科学家Jose Carmena共同领导了这项研究。,"Maharbiz, together with his colleagues and Jose Carmena, a neuroscientist at University of California, Berkeley, led the research."
851,他解释说，“采用体内遥测技术曾经是绝无可能的，因为无法将一个超小的物体放入很深的地方。,"""It was utterly impossible to adopt internal telemetry technology in the past, because a tiny object cannot be put into a very deep place,"" explained he."
852,但是现在，我可以拿起一个极小的物体，将它放入神经或器官、消化道或肌肉旁边，并读取数据。”,"""Now, however, I can take a tiny object and put it near nerve, organ, digestive tract or muscle, which then can read data."""
853,为了测试他们的器件，Maharbiz和Caarmena采用每一百毫秒发出六个540纳秒超声脉冲以驱动传感器。,"To test their device, Maharbiz and Caarmena utilized six 540ns ultrasonic pulse sent per 100ms to drive sensor."
854,但研究人员对于它们在大脑和中枢神经系统中也会起效很有信心。,But the researchers feel quite confident that they can also work in the brain and central nervous system.
855,神经灰尘项目的初衷是描绘下一代脑机交流互动，并使其成为一项可行的临床科技。”,"""The neural dust project is created with a vision of describing next generation brain-machine exchange and interaction and making it a feasible clinic technology."""
856,“如果一位瘫痪患者希望控制一台电脑或一个机械臂，你可以将这个电极植入大脑，它在那能终身持续工作。”,"""If a paralyzed patient hopes to control a computer or a robot arm, you can implant this electrode into his/her brain, where it can continuously work for a lifetime."""
857,两枚镜头同时工作，从而区分出明显的前后景别，产生更浅的景深。,"Since the two lenses work simultaneously, they can distinguish obvious front and rear landscapes, producing a more shallow depth of field."
858,熊本地震不仅把日本本土地域震坏了，连世界数码相机核心产业链也给震断了。,"In the wake of Kumamoto earthquake, not only local Japanese territory was damaged, but the world's core industrial chain of digital cameras was also broken."
859,自从熊本地震发生之后，索尼日本工厂亏损严重，全球数码相机的现状是缺货的缺货，涨价的涨价。,"Following the Kumamoto earthquake, Sony's plant in Japan suffered from heavy losses, causing the world's digital camera industry to be now in a situation of either short supply or rise in price."
860,索尼研发的传感器几乎为所有相机使用，没有了传感器的供应，相机就自然没法子生产了。,Almost all the sensors developed by Sony are used for cameras. The absence of sensor supply means no cameras to be produced.
861,而最近有消息显示，索尼目前是以发行股票和债券的形式募集了近36亿美元，用于堆栈式CMOS的研发和生产。,Recently there was news that Sony has currently raised approximately US$3.6 billion in the form of issuance of stocks and bonds for the R&amp;D and production of stack CMOS.
862,只要是传感器的供应都得靠索尼，不论数码相机还是移动智能设备（没有了索尼的话科技界变成何样真不敢想象）。,"The supply of sensors is nearly made possible by Sony, regardless of digital cameras or mobile intelligent devices (I can't image what would the scientific academia looks like if there was no Sony)."
863,相比较新格式的消息，笔者还是更希望索尼能恢复正常的传感器供应，毕竟现在的相机价格真是没法看下去。,"Compared to sources about new recording format revealed, I would rather prefer to see Sony can recover its normal supply of sensors, because today's camera prices are extremely high."
864,梅西百货将关闭100个店铺,Macy's to close 100 stores
865,百货商店巨头梅西百货周四表示，该公司计划关闭100个店铺，这一重大举措旨在帮助该连锁企业摆脱一个潜在的严重问题：该公司称，在网上购物时兴的时代，美国的实体店铺实在太多了。,"Department store giant Macy's said on Thursday that it plans to close 100 stores, a dramatic step that is aimed at helping the chain get ahead of a potentially crippling problem: America, it says, has too many stores for the online shopping era."
866,梅西百货对旗下店铺组合进行定期调整，经常在一年一度的假期高峰之后就马上关闭数十个表现不佳的店铺。,"Macy's regularly prunes its store portfolio, often moving to close several dozen underperforming stores right after the annual holiday rush."
867,不过，该公司在一份夏季公告中宣布旗下728处店铺中的15%将被关闭。这家连锁企业似乎正在采取比许多零售业同行更加激进的姿态，收缩店铺规模以应对现实中快速变化的购物环境。,"But in dropping a summertime announcement that it will close 15 per cent of its 728 locations, the chain appears to be adopting a more aggressive posture than many of its retail industry counterparts about girding its fleet for the reality of a fast-changing shopping environment."
868,行人与购物者穿行在纽约一家梅西百货商店门前。,Pedestrians and shoppers pass in front of a Macy's store in New York.
869,该零售业巨头表示计划关闭100个店铺。,The retail giant has said it plans to close 100 stores.
870,梅西百货有众多理由努力做出改变：该公司旗下许多店铺处于地区型的小型购物广场内，那种商场的人流量已经因电子商务的兴起而遭受了重创。,"Macy's has plenty of reasons to scramble to make a change: Many of its stores are located in small, regional malls, the kind whose foot traffic has been especially hard-hit by the rise of e-commerce."
871,而且，随着购物者日益倾向于前往折扣零售商（例如T.J. Maxx）以及快捷型时尚公司（例如H&amp;M）购买他们的服装，百货商店这一零售类型普遍陷入了苦苦挣扎的境地。,And the department store category has generally struggled as shoppers increasingly turn to off-price retailers such as T.J. Maxx and fast-fashion players such as H&amp;M to buy their clothes.
872,这些因素再加上一些短期问题（例如：国际游客消费下降以及不合时宜的天气）使得梅西百货经历了长达一年多的困难时期。,"These factors, along with short-term hitches such as decreased spending by international tourists and unseasonable weather, have left Macy's in a rough patch that has stretched for more than a year."
873,周四，该公司表示，最近一个季度的可比销售额下降了2.6%，表现疲弱，不过与前一季度中同比下滑6.1%的惨淡业绩相比仍有所改善。,"On Thursday, the company said it saw a 2.6 per cent drop in comparable sales in the most recent quarter, a weak performance that was nonetheless an improvement over the dismal 6.1 per cent year-over-year decline it recorded in the previous quarter."
874,该零售商实现营收58.7亿美元（76.4亿澳元），比上年同期下降3.9%。,"The retailer's revenue was $US5.87 billion ($A7.64 billion), down 3.9 per cent from the same period last year."
875,梅西百货表示，这些店铺的关张可能会使年度销售额减少约10亿美元。,Macy's said the store closures would probably cost it about $US1 billion in annual sales.
876,在过去，如此大批店铺的关张可能会被视作零售商因经营失败而作的妥协。,"And at one time, such a large batch of store closures might have been viewed as a retailer's concession of defeat."
877,然而，该公司的股票周四飙涨了17%，显示投资者将此举视为预示着梅西百货未来会有更强劲表现的积极举措。,"Yet the company's stock soared 17 per cent on Thursday, a sign that investors view the move as a proactive measure that portends a stronger future for Macy's."
878,从某些方面而言，梅西百货裁减店铺不应是一种惊喜。,"In some ways, it should not come as a surprise that Macy's is slashing stores."
879,梅西百货首席执行官特里·伦德格伦曾表示过这家连锁企业只是店铺数量太多了。,"Terry Lundgren, the retailer's chief executive, has said before that the chain simply had too many stores."
880,高层管理一段时间以来一直在说，他们正在制定一个战略，将重点放在约150个业绩最好的店铺上，尝试在那些业绩不错的地点再挤出更多销售额。,"Executives have been saying for some time that they are embracing a strategy that puts particular emphasis on roughly 150 of their top-performing stores, trying to wring more sales out of those already-productive locations."
881,将于2017年取代伦德格伦成为首席执行官的梅西百货高管杰夫·吉内特在一份声明中表示，该公司计划关闭的所有这些店铺均为销售额与利润一直在下滑的店铺。,"Jeff Gennette, the Macy's executive who has been appointed to replace Lundgren in 2017, said in a statement that nearly all of the stores the company plans to close are ones at which sales volume and profitability have been sliding."
882,吉内特说：“我们确认这些地点的投资回报率不足，而且往往不能表现出我们所期望的梅西百货品牌代表的客户购物体验。”,"""We recognise that these locations do not yield an adequate return on investment and often do not represent a customer shopping experience that reflects our aspirations for the Macy's brand,"" Gennette said."
883,该公司表示会提供一份将要关张的店铺的名单。,The company said it would offer a list of the stores that will close at a later date.
884,梅西百货表示，该公司仍在就关闭哪些店铺做最后决定，因而尚不能准确断定将裁减多少工作岗位。,"Macy's said it is still finalising which stores it would shutter, and thus has not yet determined exactly how many jobs will be slashed."
885,该零售商不会完全退出目前已有店铺在其中经营的任何一流商场，但将寻求关闭那些处在业绩不佳的地点的店铺。,"The retailer will not pull out entirely of any of the top markets where it currently operates stores, but will look to close stores that are in weak locations."
886,此举对于购物中心运营商而言可能不是好消息，它们依靠像梅西百货这样的大租户来吸引和留住其他较小店铺在购物中心里经营。,"The move is likely unwelcome news to mall operators, who count on big tenants like Macy's to attract and retain other smaller stores in their shopping centres."
887,你的水瓶里是否窝藏了危险的细菌？,Is your water bottle harbouring dangerous bacteria?
888,根据新研究结果，就你会接触到的细菌数量而言，从可重新装水的水瓶中饮水可能“在许多时候比添你家小狗的玩具更加糟糕”。,"According to new research, drinking from refillable water bottle can be ""many times worse than licking your dog's toy"" in terms of the amount of bacteria it will bring you into contact with."
889,名为跑步机评论的网站委托EmLab P&amp;K测试了4种不同类型（包括旋盖式、滑盖式、挤压盖式和吸管盖式）的12只水瓶。,"The website Treadmill Reviews commissioned EmLab P&amp;K to test 12 water bottles of four different types - screw-top, slide-top, squeeze-top, and straw-top."
890,每只水瓶均由一名运动员使用一个星期，且不进行清洗。,Each water bottle had been used by an athlete for a week without being washed.
891,你家的可重新装水的水瓶可能就像狗狗的玩具一样脏。,Your refillable water bottle could be as dirty as a dog toy.
892,"Treadmill Reviews表示：“基于所测试的12只水瓶，我们发现可重复使用的饮水容器可以窝藏数量惊人的活菌细胞：每平方厘米菌落形成单位(CFU)数量超过300,000个。”","""Based on the 12 water bottles we tested, we found that reusable drinking containers may be crawling with an alarming number of viable bacteria cells: more than 300,000 colony-forming units per square centimeter (CFU/sq cm),"" Treadmill Reviews said."
893,"试验发现滑盖式水瓶的细菌含量最高，平均每平方厘米菌落形成单位数量超过900,000个。","Slide-top were found to have the highest germ content, with more than 900,000 colony-forming units per square centimetre (CFU/sq) cm on average."
894,瓶盖中窝藏有革兰氏阳性球菌，这种细菌可导致皮肤感染、肺炎或血液中毒。,"The bottles harboured gram-positive cocci, which can lead to skin infections, pneumonia, or blood poisoning."
895,其次是挤压盖式水瓶，每平方厘米菌落形成单位数为162000个，而旋盖式水瓶的细菌数则接近每平方厘米160000个CFU。,"Squeeze-top bottles were next-worse with 162,000 CFU/sq cm, and screw-top containers hosted just under 160,000 CFU/sq cm."
896,该网站补充道：“用这些水瓶喝水可能比用你家宠物的盘子装饭吃还要糟糕。”,"""Drinking from these bottles can still be worse than eating a meal from your pet's dish,"" the site added."
897,对吸管盖式水瓶的试验取得的结果要好得多，其所含细菌数远小于其他水瓶的细菌数，每平方厘米只有25个CFU。,"A far better picture emerged from tests on straw-top bottles, which were found to contain a fraction of the bacteria of other bottles - just 25 CFU/sq cm."
898,这可能是因为水输送到吸管底部而不是逗留在瓶里吸引喜潮湿的细菌。,This may be because water drips to the bottom of the straw rather than sticking around to attract moisture-loving germs.
899,吸管盖式水瓶中的细菌被描述为“通常无害”。,"The germs that were present in the straw-top bottles were described as ""mostly harmless."""
900,该网站说：“根据试验结果，我们建议选用吸管盖式水瓶，因为这种水瓶的细菌流行率较低而且有害细菌数量少。”,"""Based on our test results, we suggest opting for a straw-top bottle, both for the low prevalence of bacteria and the lack of harmful germs,"" the site said."
901,我们还了解到，就水瓶和细菌问题而言，不锈钢水瓶是比塑料水瓶更好的选择。,"We also know that when it comes to water bottles and bacteria, stainless steel is a better choice than plastic."
902,此外，没有缝隙和难以清洁斑点的水瓶成为细菌宿主的可能性较低。,"Additionally, water bottles without crevices and tough-to-clean spots are less likely to host germs."
903,该网站建议读者在每次使用完之后都要清洗水瓶，较为理想的方法是用弱漂白性的溶液进行清洗。,"The site advises readers to wash water bottles after each use, ideally with a weak bleach solution."
904,宗教必须现代化否则面临淘汰,Religion must either modernise or face obsolescence
905,美国民主党最近提名希拉里·克林顿为其总统候选人。,In the United States the Democratic Party recently nominated Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate.
906,如果最新民意调查结果在选举时仍能保持不变，美国史上第一位女总统将于1月宣誓就职。,"If the results of the latest polls hold true at election time, America will swear in its first female president in January."
907,上周，在大西洋彼岸，英国首相特里萨·梅正与德国总理安格拉·默克尔就英国退出欧盟的条件进行商谈。,"The previous week, across the pond, British Prime Minister Theresa May was negotiating the terms of Britain's exit from Europe with Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel."
908,生活在西方社会的妇女们在成长过程中所受的熏陶使她们相信自己能够通过教育、志向和努力工作而胜任任何职业角色并获得成功。,"Women living in Western society have been raised to believe they can be competent and successful in any professional role through education, ambition and hard work."
909,如今，年轻女子们可以把一些在最高领导层工作的活生生的人物作为她们的榜样。,And young girls today can point at several living role models operating at the highest levels of leadership.
910,那么，为争取妇女平等权利所进行的长期艰苦斗争终于结束了吗？,So is the long and hard battle for women's equality finally over?
911,希拉里·克林顿为当选美国总统而蓄势待发，不过女性领导权在宗教领域仍然是个有争议的问题。,"Hillary Clinton is poised to become president of the United States, but in the religious sphere women's leadership is still a contentious issue."
912,好吧，没有完全结束。,"Well, not entirely."
913,女性领导权在宗教领域仍然是个有争议的问题。,In the religious sphere women's leadership remains a contentious issue.
914,上周，教皇方济各宣布成立新的委员会商议是否应该任命女性作为天主教教会的执事。,Last week Pope Francis announced a new commission to consider whether women should be made deacons in the Catholic Church.
915,2015年1月，英国圣公会任命丽比·莱恩为该教会第一位女主教，而在2012年时一次类似尝试却以失败而告终。,"The Anglican Church consecrated Libby Lane as its first female bishop in January 2015, but this was only after a failed attempt in 2012."
916,虽然犹太教改革运动自20世纪70年代初以来一直任命女性拉比（犹太教祭司），不过自20世纪80年代以来出现保守主义运动，在正统犹太教中对女性拉比的观念仍然存在着激烈的争论。,"While the Jewish Reform movement has been ordaining female rabbis since the early 1970s, and the Conservative movement since the early 1980s, in Orthodox Judaism the notion of female rabbis is still hotly contested."
917,2015年11月，美国正统派犹太教理事会发表了一份严正公告声明女性拉比不合法，这是该理事会第三次尝试抵抗日益扩大的支持正统派女性按立拉比圣职的潮流。,"In November 2015, the Orthodox Rabbinical Council of America - in its third attempt to stem the growing tide of support for Orthodox women's rabbinical ordination - published a stern proclamation declaring the illegitimacy of female rabbis."
918,不无讽刺的是，就在希拉里·克林顿收货民主党总统候选人提名之时，反对女性按立圣职的一群领衔的美国正统派拉比就这个有争议的话题发起了一系列“听证会”。,"Not without irony, as Hillary Clinton wrapped up the democratic presidential nomination a group of leading American Orthodox rabbis opposed to women's ordination launched a series of ""hearings"" on this disputed subject."
919,在世俗领域和宗教领域之间为何有如此差距？,Why is there such disparity between the secular realm and the sacred?
920,像大多数教派一样，正统派犹太教也寻求使它认为能延续传统价值观的做法维持稳定。,"Orthodox Judaism, like most religions, seeks stability in what it considers enduring traditional values."
921,这就体现为对适应变化社会的压力的抵制。,This finds expression in resisting the pressure to conform to a changing society.
922,那些反对者的依据是女性按立圣职不符合“传统”。,"Those who oppose women's ordination do so on the basis that it is not ""traditional."""
923,不过，以这种方式执着保持传统并非没有代价。,But the obsession with maintaining tradition in this way is not without a cost.
924,这种忠贞的代价可能会使传统社群失去它赖以为生的氧气，从而事与愿违地对传统本身造成破坏。,And the cost of such single-mindedness can paradoxically be the undermining of tradition itself by depriving the traditional community of the oxygen it needs to remain vibrant.
925,在第一次世界大战军事史书籍《八月炮火》中，巴巴拉·塔奇曼通过被称为“红裤子的悲剧”的史料强调了传统至上的危险性。,"In The Guns of August, a military history of the First World War, Barbara Tuchman highlights the danger of prioritising tradition in what has become known as the ""tragedy of the red trousers."""
926,在第一次世界大战前夕，随着战争从近距离战斗发展为从更远的距离进行重炮射击，尽可能长时间地隐蔽士兵就能占据优势。,"In the lead up to WWI, as warfare shifted from fighting at close quarters to heavier artillery fired from greater distance, it become advantageous to conceal soldiers for as long as possible."
927,英国和德国军队对这一变化作出的响应是，将色彩明亮的制服更换为单调的灰色与棕色制服。,The British and German armies reacted to this change by exchanging their bright coloured uniforms for drab greys and browns.
928,不过，法国士兵仍然沿用着同样的红色帽子和裤子，于是在战场上成为了非常显眼的目标。,"The French soldiers, however, still wore the same red caps and trousers, marking them out as easy targets."
929,法国陆军部长阿道夫·梅希米提出让他的部队采用相同做法的建议遭到了嘲笑与反对。,The suggestion of the French war minister Adolphe Messimy that his armies do likewise was met with ridicule and resistance.
930,红色裤子代表着军队的荣誉与声望，军事传统主义者并不打算放弃它。,The red trousers represented army pride and prestige and military traditionalists were not prepared to give it up.
931,在一次议会听证会上，前陆军部长尤金·艾蒂安对法国发表演讲。,"At a parliamentary hearing, a former war minister, Eugene Etienne, spoke for France."
932,他喊道：“要淘汰红色的裤子？”,"""Eliminate the red trousers?"" he cried."
933,休想！,Never!
934,梅希米后来写道：“盲目且愚蠢地依恋于最显眼的色彩招致了残酷的后果。”,"""That blind and imbecile attachment to the most visible of all colours,"" wrote Messimy afterwards, ""was to have cruel consequences."""
935,抵制女性担任宗教领导角色的宗教领袖正处在同样陷阱的危险之中。,Faith leaders grappling with women's inclusion in religious leadership roles are in danger of the same pitfall.
936,他们只关注其宗教的“传统做法”而不自问这样一个关键问题：“必需什么变革才能使宗教保持兴盛？”他们的风险在于疏远了50%的群众。,"By focusing exclusively on ""what is traditional"" for their religion rather than asking the crucial question: ""What change is necessary for religion to thrive?"" they risk alienating 50 per cent of their flock."
937,他们还使整个社群排斥女性群体所能贡献出的人才、技能与热情。,"They also deprive the entire community of the talent, skills and enthusiasm that women would otherwise contribute."
938,就宗教而言，固执地让男人继续穿那些裤子可能符合传统，但是，正如红裤子惨败所启示的那样，这种做法可能并不值得。,"Insisting that men continue to wear the trousers when it comes to religion might be traditional, but, as the pantalon rouge debacle illustrates, it may not be worth the price."
939,迪娜·包尔是英国犹太正统女性主义联盟的创始人，也是纽约“Yeshivat Maharat”犹太学校的正统派拉比学生。,"Dina Brawer is founder of JOFA, the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance, in the UK and an Orthodox rabbinical student at Yeshivat Maharat in New York."
940,查尔顿竞技队球迷只有签署行为合约并同意不在社交媒体上诋毁俱乐部才能获得赛季门票,Charlton Athletic fan 'can only get season ticket if he signs behavioural contract' and agrees not to badmouth club on social media
941,虽然我们认可每个人都有权持有自己个人的看法，但在社交网站上张贴煽动性言论却没有助益。,"Whilst we recognise that everyone is entitled to their own personal opinion, it is not helpful when inflammatory comments are posted on such websites."
942,这名从事行政工作的球迷随后被告知必须亲自前往前总警司克利夫·伊格那里获取门票，克利夫·伊格在35年的从警生涯之后于上个月加入了该俱乐部。,"The fan, who works in administration, was then told he would have to pick the ticket up in person from former police Chief Inspector Cliff Eager, who joined the club last month after a 35-year career in the police force."
943,该信件接着写道：“我需要提醒你的是，对你授予赛季门票将是‘有条件’的，你必须签署一份‘约定行为合约’，该合约要求你未来保持克制，不得在任何社交媒体网站上张贴针对本俱乐部或俱乐部代表人员的贬低性言辞或煽动性言论，也不得做出其他任何形式的可能被视为具有反社会性质的举动。”,"The letter continued: ""I need to advise you that the granting of your season ticket will be 'conditioned' and subject to you signing an 'Agreed Behavioural Contract' (ABC) which will request that you refrain from posting derogatory or inflammatory comments regarding the Club or people representing the club in the future on any social media websites, or carrying out any other form of behaviour that could be deemed to be on an anti-social nature."""
944,该球迷对每日电讯报描述了他如何先付钱购买赛季门票然后打电话给俱乐部，不过两天后那张门票没有现身，却收到了这封寄来的信。,"Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, the fan described how he called the club after paying for his season ticket, which never showed up and two days later the letter arrived in the post."
945,昨天他去俱乐部参加完面谈之后表示：“他们告诉我，我在推特上的言论一向极端并影响了他人的推特言论，我觉得这很荒谬。”,"Yesterday, he went to the meeting with the club and said: ""They told me I had been tweeting excessively and causing other people to tweet as well - which is ridiculous.'"
946,达尔马提亚海岸的假日骑行,A cycling holiday down the Dalmatian coast
947,你的意思是什么，奢侈吗？,"What do you mean, luxury?"
948,前美国海军指挥官科琳说：“我骑得屁股都掉了。”她刚刚完成了沿着崎岖的克罗地亚岛脊柱方向骑行25英里的自行车之旅，沿路留下了大把汗水和面对艰难山路所发出的一连串海军式的辛辣喊叫声。,"I rode my butt off back there,"" says Colleen, a former US naval commander who has just completed a 25-mile bike ride along the spine of some rugged Croatian island and left nothing out there but a bucketful of sweat and a salvo of salty naval expletives hurled at the hostile hills."
949,有些自行车骑手哼唱赞美诗或背诵儿歌在艰难的爬坡过程中让自己分分神。,Some cyclists sing hymns or recite nursery rhymes as a climbing aid.
950,科琳的朋友帕蒂建议哼唱《小货车做到了》。,Colleen's friend Patty recommends The Little Engine That Could.
951,其他人要么数着圈数要么默默忍受，想着怎样才能进入老练的骑手们所谓的恍惚状态。,"Others count revolutions or just suffer in silence, wondering what it takes to enter the trance-like state of which hardened cyclists speak."
952,科琳用各种恶毒的方式诅咒着。,"Colleen swears, with more venom than variety."
953,在她前方几码之外骑行就像是在《四个婚礼和一个葬礼》的片头中那样被休·格兰特所追逐。,Cycling a few yards ahead of her is like being pursued by Hugh Grant in the opening sequence of Four Weddings and a Funeral.
954,她和我的任务是在克罗地亚北部的达尔马提亚海岸和岛屿进行为期一周的“豪华”游轮和自行车巡游，组织方为Freedom Treks。,"Her mission and mine is a week-long ""luxury"" boat and bike tour of Croatia's north Dalmatian coast and islands, organised by Freedom Treks."
955,盛夏季节在克罗地亚这样地势陡峭的地方进行自行车骑行可能不符合所有人的奢侈概念，不过据说达尔马提亚北部要比南部更便于骑行，我们采用的是软坐垫，在那几个月以前当我们无忧无虑且自信满满地填写预订表时，有一个选框只要勾选就能确保援助我们一辆电动自行车，但我们没有勾选。,"Cycling at the height of summer in such a steeply pitched place as Croatia might not fit everyone's idea of luxury, but north Dalmatia is said to be an easier ride than south, our saddles are soft and when we filled in our booking forms in carefree and confident manner all those months ago there was a box we failed to tick that could have secured us the assistance of a battery-powered e-bike."
956,这笔交易的奢侈部分是我们要在漂浮的家中住一周的时间，那就是崭新的“旋律号”游轮。,"The luxury part of the deal is our floating home for the week, the brand new Melody."
957,骑行结束时，我们可以把自行车弃置在码头，由我们的向导伊凡和伊凡娜来收拾好。然后，我们从游轮后部跳入湛蓝的大海，海水清澈，很容易分辨海胆、尖锐岩石和其他游人，这个克罗地亚人称之为海滩的地方到处都是手帕大小的长条形卵石。,"At the end of the ride we can dump our bikes on the quay for our guides Ivan and Ivana to stow, and jump off the back of the boat into clear blue water without having to mix it with sea urchins, sharp rocks and other people on the hanky sized strips of pebbles that Croatians call a beach."
958,这片海水在6月末时的温度最为理想，大家都同意这一点：清凉得足以提神，但不觉得冷。,"In late June the sea is a perfect temperature, all agree: cool enough to refresh, but not cold."
959,如果有人在上午艰苦的骑行之后还觉得精力旺盛的话，那么旋律号游轮上备有面罩、呼吸管和几条皮划艇。,The Melody is stocked with masks and snorkels and a couple of kayaks should anyone feel energetic after a hard morning in the saddle.
960,不过我们大多数人宁愿回到空调客舱中，船上的女按摩师海伦娜（我可不是开玩笑）会已经铺好了我们的床，补充好冰箱中的食品，然后在桌上留下一盒新的巧克力。,"Instead, most of us retreat to our air-conditioned cabins where Helena, the ship's masseuse - I'm not joking - will have made our beds, restocked our minibars and left a new box of chocs on the table."
961,伊凡说，自行车骑行之后做做伸展运动很重要，我们下午在自己的床上或者在顶层甲板的软垫躺椅上练习伸展运动，酒保安东尼奥随时准备献上他调配的鸡尾酒。,"Ivan says stretching is important after cycling, and we practise stretching out for the afternoon on our beds or a cushioned lounger on the top deck with Antonio the barman ever ready to administer one of his cocktails."
962,旋律号游轮并不是优越的超级油轮，而是时髦的小游轮，它长42米，配有15个客舱和半打船员。,"The Melody, at 42m long with 15 cabins and a crew of half a dozen shipmates, is no bulging superyacht but a stylish little cruiser."
963,在小岛屿港口的所有渔船和度假游船当中，她显得引人注目，我们作为船上的一员深感骄傲。,"She turns heads in a small island port among the fishing boats and flotilla holiday yachts, and we are proud to belong to her."
964,科琳和帕蒂来自美国华盛顿特区一个名为meetup.com的网站组织的朋友群：他们自称为“45岁以上运动与社交群”。,"Colleen and Patty belong to a meetup.com group of friends from Washington DC: the Over 45 Sport and Socials, they call themselves."
965,去年在荷兰组织的驳船与自行车假日活动取得了圆满成功，于是他们决定尝试更加冒险的活动，现在他们来到了克罗地亚。,Last year's barge and bike holiday in the Netherlands was such a success they decided to try something more adventurous and here they are in Croatia.
966,与他们教堂的展开竞争的一家小教堂正在普罗旺斯进行游轮与自行车度假活动，每天下午在脸谱网上你来我往竞相发帖让气氛更浓。,"A rival chapel of their church is doing a boat and bike holiday in Provence, and every afternoon the ether thickens with a ping pong rally of competitive Facebook postings."
967,假日里的冒险元素可能说得过于夸张了，因为如果不严格管制的话，我们就会跟不上日程安排。,"The adventure element of the holiday can be overstated, because our schedule is nothing if not regimented."
968,当我们从斯普利特附近风光秀丽的特罗吉尔老港口启航时，伊凡在欢迎会上向初来乍到的人宣布：“早餐和晚餐均安排在八点。”,"""Breakfast and dinner are at eight o'clock,"" Ivan announced to the new intake at the welcome briefing as we set sail from the beautiful old port of Trogir, near Split."
969,船上的钟鸣响一次即表示自助餐开始了，用餐结束后再鸣响一次即表示请大家安静，仔细倾听下一个简报。,One ring of the ship's bell declares the buffet open and another at the end of the meal calls for silence and listen carefully to the next briefing.
970,“Good moaning”除了英国人恐怕大家都已忘却了这一诙谐语。,"""Good moaning!"" is a cultural reference perhaps lost on all but the British contingent."
971,管他呢，打趣和玩笑尽管手到拈来。伊凡娜拿出当天的远足示意图，我们都假装被图上的弯弯绕绕、阴影轮廓和起起落落的路线给吓坏了，不过对于在克罗地亚进行从海岸线到海岸线的骑自行车远足而言，其他的一切都会是一种惊喜。,"Who cares - the banter is well rehearsed and the jokes come thin and fast, while Ivana hands out sketch maps of the day's excursion and we all pretend to be horrified by the wiggles, contour shading and a profile with ups and downs on it, although anything else would be a surprise on a Croatian bike ride that starts and finishes at sea level."
972,伊凡说：“这就像是心电图。”,"""It's like a heart monitor,"" says Ivan."
973,完全平坦的路线并不在推荐的范围内。,Completely flat is not recommended.
974,伊凡用英语和德语频频切换着进行了简要介绍。,"Ivan delivers his briefing in parallel text, switching fluently between English and German."
975,数周以来，他已经应付了来自十几个国家的游客，不过我们是一群容易应付的人（瑞士人、德国人、美国人和英国人），在用餐时分为两桌英语人群和一桌德语人群，十分方便。,"Some weeks he has a dozen different nationalities to contend with, but we are an easy group - Swiss, German, American and British - which divides easily at mealtimes into two English speaking tables, one German."
976,大家一路上都成为了好朋友。,On the road we are all friends.
977,友情在骑行中增进，唯一的竞争对手是地形地貌，也就是说自我竞争。,"Cycling breeds camaraderie, and the only competition is with the terrain, which is to say ourselves."
978,这是我记忆中最和谐、最放松的群体活动。,I can't remember a more harmonious and relaxed group dynamic.
979,我们很快（把无线电）调到伊凡的波长。,We soon tune in to Ivan's wave length.
980,艰难攀爬路段是指一段上坡，不要与起伏路段混淆，起伏路段较容易。,"A stiff climb is an incline, not to be confused with an undulation, which is a good thing."
981,发夹路段是指蜿蜒曲折的路段，而直行路段则表示径直骑行：简单但并不总是容易。,Hairpins are serpentines and straightforward means straight on: simple but not always easy.
982,骑行指令总是一样：“一列纵队，保持距离，这不是比赛。”,"Cycling instructions are always the same: ""Single file, keep your distance, and it's not a race."
983,我们九点在码头集合。,We meet on the quay at nine.
984,好吧，那就九点零五分，我忘了你们在度假。,"OK, five past - you're on holiday, I forgot."
985,需要带上大量的水。,Take lots of water.
986,我们从特罗吉尔开始两天的向北巡航，穿过科纳提群岛，在那里我们会顺着Dugi Otok（克罗地亚语中的“长岛”）骑行一大段路程，睡醒之后在特拉斯卡自然公园漫步，欣赏高耸的悬崖峭壁以及由于海水从地下通道灌入而形成的盐湖。,"From Trogir our cruise takes us northwards for two days through the Kornati archipelago, where we ride most of the length of Dugi Otok - Croatian for ""long island"" - and have our slumbers interrupted for a walk in the Telašćica Nature Park, to admire its high cliffs and a salt lake fed by sea water through an underground channel."
987,据说在这个湖里游泳能让人恢复年轻活力。,It is said to have rejuvenating power for all who swim in it.
988,如果涉水前行，我们的脚会变得更加年轻、有力吗？,"If we paddle, will our legs feel younger and stronger?"
989,在名为莫拉特的小岛上，我们再度折向南方，在陆地和附近岛屿之间即兴徜徉。,"At the small island of Molat we turn south again, hopping between mainland and nearby islands in seemingly haphazard fashion."
990,我们的骑行路程大多是乡村空旷小路，沿途是开阔的海景和各种果蔬：橄榄园、葡萄园和荆棘丛；空气中弥漫着地中海的气息，无数的蝴蝶扑闪着翅膀。,"Most of our rides are on empty little roads through open country with big sea views and mixed veg: olive groves, vineyards, prickly herbal scrub; Mediterranean scents in the air and myriad butterflies on the wing."
991,前行的路上总是有阵阵微风，不过阴凉之处弥足珍贵，遇到这样的地方伊凡就让车队停下来休息，对于早到的骑手而言，清凉的小水池就是一种奖励。,"While we roll along there is always a breeze but shade is at a premium when Ivan calls a halt, and small pools of it are the reward for early arrivals."
992,这个运动与社交群在周末会组织许多团体自行车骑行活动，他们了解相关礼仪，在一路上会进行各种提醒，并在骑行时让出道路以便汽车驾驶员能更安全地超越。,"The Sport and Socials do a lot of group cycling at weekends and they know the etiquette, sending warnings up and down the line and leaving gaps so that motorists can overtake more safely."
993,当一辆卡车试图在一个死角处超车并紧急刹车之后，一名骑手对另一名骑手说：“你差点就撞上车头了。”,"""You were nearly a hood ornament there,"" one cyclist tells another, after a truck driver thought better of overtaking on a blind corner and hit the brakes hard."
994,幸运的是，他们安全通过了。,Fortunately they worked.
995,在偶尔需要在主干道上骑行时，伊凡将我们分为了三组，由伊凡娜在队伍的最后鼓励队员，就像伊凡所说的把队员“捞起来”。,"Ivan divides us into three groups for the occasional short stretches of cycling on main roads, with Ivana at the very back to encourage and ""scoop up,"" as Ivan puts it."
996,在必须穿越主干道时，我们就全体集合，下车步行，把自行车推行至另一侧的安全地带，按照指示行动而不能自作主张。,"And if a main road must be crossed we all assemble, dismount and walk our bikes to the safety of the other side, as instructed and not before."
997,当我们站在路旁等待穿越的指示时，一位瑞士骑手问道：“你们觉得伊凡有没有意识到他不是在对一群孩子发号施令？”,"""Do you think Ivan realises he is not speaking to a group of children?"" a Swiss cyclist asks, as we stand beside the road waiting for the signal to cross."
998,我们的下午时光也并非总是清闲。,Our afternoons are not all devoted to idleness.
999,在扎达尔市的城市旅行中，我们游览了罗马论坛遗迹和海浪风琴，海浪风琴发出的音乐就像海怪在笼子里的呻吟，音乐声通过开口面向海水的管道而发出，这些管道设置在由石块码垛成的走廊里。,"A city tour at Zadar reveals remains of a Roman forum and a sea organ which plays music like the moan of a caged sea monster, through pipes set in the stone fabric of the promenade and open to the water."
1000,用餐完毕要享用布丁之时，是欣赏扎达尔著名的日落风景的绝佳时刻。黄昏过后，我们重返海浪风琴，欣赏玻璃铺成的人行道上用波浪发电点亮的灯光，那就像是地面在舞动。,"Zadar's famous sunset is perfectly timed between main course and pudding, and after dark we return to the sea organ and watch the play of wave-powered lights in a glass pavement - a dance floor, in fact."
1001,当旋律号一大早启航前往热闹的度假胜地贝尔格莱德时，海浪风琴的歌声就像是耳边的呢喃。,"When Melody sets sail for the lively resort of Biograd in the early morning, the organ's song is no more than a whisper."
1002,第五天是完全自由骑行。,Day five is entirely free of cycling.
1003,乘船游览克尔卡河入海口，观看它的瀑布；下午游览希贝尼克的圆顶大教堂，这是达尔马提亚人文艺复兴时期的杰作；在平静的兹拉林岛上黄昏漫步，寻找当地特产珊瑚——我们度过了非常有趣的一天。,"A boat trip up the Krka river estuary to visit its waterfalls; an afternoon tour of Sibenik with its domed cathedral, a masterpiece of the Dalmatian Renaissance; and a twilight stroll on the peaceful island of Zlarin in search of its local speciality, coral - make for an interesting day."
1004,卢尔德不顾袭击威胁准备迎接朝圣者,Lourdes prepares for pilgrims in shadow of attacks
1005,人们在一年一度的天主教朝圣期间向卢尔德圣母院的圣地汇集。,People gather during the annual Catholic pilgrimage at the sanctuary of Notre Dame de Lourdes.
1006,随着成千上万天主教徒在卢尔德圣母院聚集进行年度朝圣活动，法国安全部队正高度戒备，因为不久前才发生一系列恐怖袭击事件。,French security forces are on high alert as thousands of Catholics converge on the shrine of Lourdes for an annual pilgrimage unfolding in the shadow of a string of terror attacks.
1007,8月15日是圣母玛利亚蒙召升天的日子，每年此时都有好几万人蜂拥至位于比利牛斯山麓的圣地纪念圣母升天日。,"Each year, tens of thousands flock to the sanctuary in the foothills of the Pyrenees for the Feast of the Assumption on August 15, marking the ascent of the Virgin Mary into Heaven."
1008,今年的朝圣来临之际，天主教却受到法国一名老年神父被害案的不利影响，7月26日两名伊斯兰极端分子在弥撒期间闯入了这名老神父在法国北部的教堂并割断了他的喉咙。,"This year's pilgrimage comes as Catholics reel from the killing of an elderly French priest on July 26 by two Islamist extremists, who stormed his church in northern France during Mass and slit his throat."
1009,在神父雅克·哈默尔谋杀案发生前两周，一位突尼斯人（调查人员称其受网上伊斯兰圣战视频的影响而成为极端分子）在海滨城市尼斯驾驶卡车冲进了法国国庆日的庆祝人群，造成85人死亡。,"Jacques Hamel's murder came under two weeks after a Tunisian -- said by investigators to have become radicalised by online jihadist videos -- ploughed a truck into a Bastille Day crowd in the Riviera city of Nice, killing 85 people."
1010,在18个月内发生三起大规模袭击事件之后，许多法国人现在对于参加公众集会心怀顾虑。,Many in France are now leery about attending public gatherings after three large-scale attacks in 18 months.
1011,法国的入境游客数量暴跌，有关部门已经担心参见今年朝圣的游客人数会锐减。,"With tourist arrivals in the country plummeting, authorities had worried that the number of visitors to this year's pilgrimage would be sharply down."
1012,不过，对取消弥撒的担心并没有成真，一些组织者表示在随后时刻甚至出现人数激增现象。,But fears of mass cancellations have failed to materialise -- and some organisers say there has even been a last-minute surge.
1013,"预计会有约25,000名信徒，包括来自意大利和比利时的弥撒团体，以及约200名成员组成的基督教分支东正教代表团。","Around 25,000 faithful are expected, including mass groups from Italy and Belgium and a delegation of around 200 members of the Eastern Orthodox branch of Christianity."
1014,许多朝圣者表示，他们不会畏缩。,Many pilgrims say they will not be cowed.
1015,66岁的游客克里斯蒂安对法新社表示：“我们不会停止生活。”他说在暴利面前祈祷是“唯一武器”。,"""We're not going to stop living,"" Christian, a 66-year-old visitor, told AFP, describing prayer as the ""only weapon"" in the face of violence."
1016,作为协调员之一的马蒂厄·吉尼亚尔表示：“重要的是展现生活在继续。”,"""It's important to show that life goes on,"" said Matthieu Guignard, one of the coordinators."
1017,不能因为一些狂热分子试图散播恐惧，我们就放弃我们的信念、我们的信仰和我们的生活方式。,"It's not because a few fanatics try to sow fear that we should abandon our faith, our beliefs, our way of living."
1018,自尼斯袭击事件以来，出于治安考虑，法国取消了一些大型活动，其中包括北部城市里尔的大型跳蚤市场，以及原定于9月在尼斯举行的欧洲公路自行车锦标赛。,"Several major events have been cancelled in France since the Nice attack over security concerns, including a huge flea market in the northern city of Lille and the European road cycling championships that had been set to take place in Nice in September."
1019,负责官方朝圣活动的牧师法比安·勒琼上周末表示：“在过去的一个星期，我所担心的是会接到取消活动的电话。”,"""For the past week, my fear was that my phone would be ringing with cancellations,"" Fabien Lejeusne, the priest in charge of the official pilgrimage said last weekend."
1020,不过，他表示，袭击事件似乎调动了信徒，预订人数在最后时刻出现激增。,"Instead, the attacks appeared to mobilise the faithful, he said, reporting a last-minute bookings spurt."
1021,当地酒店工会负责人克里斯蒂安·格丽斯确认，一些迹象显示在袭击事件发生后参加朝圣的“意愿增长”。,"The head of the local hotel workers' union, Christian Gelis, confirmed signs of ""increased interest"" in the pilgrimage in the wake of the attacks."
1022,圣殿周围建造的圣所附近的治安被显著加强。相传1858年圣母玛利亚曾在圣地处的洞穴里对贫穷的牧羊女贝娜黛特·苏比鲁显圣。,"Security has been dramatically tightened around the sanctuary built around the shrine, where the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared in a grotto to Bernadette Soubirous, a poor shepherd girl, in 1858."
1023,为保护该区域，已经部署了约250名警察和数十名士兵（其中包括炸弹处置专家和牵着嗅探犬的军官）。,"Around 250 police and two dozen soldiers, including bomb disposal experts and officers with sniffer dogs, have been deployed to protect the area."
1024,排队通过安检区的朝圣者在现场入口处需要经过包裹搜查，那里原先的十几个通道被削减为三个。,"Pilgrims filing through security barriers have their bags searched at the entrance to the site, where the number of access points has been reduced from a dozen to three."
1025,本月早些时候从英格兰东北出发前往卢尔德进行朝圣之旅的凯瑟琳·西姆科克斯描述了加强治安的情况。,"Catherine Simcox, who made a pilgrimage from the north east of England to Lourdes earlier this month described the heightened security."
1026,她告诉地方报说：“星期四早晨时，圣地里部署了一些武装警卫，然后大门（使用金属路障）设置成只许单排队列进入，在进门的过程中要搜查包裹。”,"""By Thursday morning, there were armed guards inside the sanctuaries and then the gates became single file entry (with metal barriers) with bags being searched on the way in,"" she told The Local."
1027,她说：“这让我的三个孩子非常紧张害怕，他们对卢尔德很熟悉，当他们问及为何要如此戒备森严时，很难不吓到他们。”,"""This total freaked my three kids out who are used to Lourdes &amp; it was hard to not scare them when they asked why it was happening,"" she said."
1028,这并没有破坏我的体验，但让我悲伤的是这样做确有必要，而且我理解这些措施让一些人感到放心。,"It didn't spoil my experience, but it saddened me that it was necessary and I understood that some people were reassured by the measures."
1029,星期五的开幕式游行路线也被缩短了，以前是在卢尔德城启程前往圣地，而现在起点和终点都设在圣母院里。,"The route of Friday's opening procession has also been curtailed -- instead of starting in the town of Lourdes and proceeding to the sanctuary, it will start and end at the shrine."
1030,其他措施还包括关闭卢尔德市的空域禁止航班通过，封锁圣地周边街道的交通，以及用透明塑料袋代替垃圾箱。,"Other measures taken including shutting down the airspace above Lourdes to flights, closing off the streets around the sanctuary to traffic and replacing rubbish bins with transparent plastic bags."
1031,法国内政部长伯纳德·卡泽纳夫将于周六对安保情况进行检查。,Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve is to inspect security arrangements on Saturday.
1032,卢尔德每年吸引大约600万人前来朝圣，是世界上最大的天主教朝圣地之一。,"Lourdes attracts around six million people a year, making it one of the biggest sites of Catholic pilgrimage in the world."
1033,许多访客还带来了生病的或残疾的亲属，让他们在贝娜黛特声称看见圣母玛利亚的洞穴里沐浴泉水，并相信那里的水具有治疗效果。,"Many visitors bring sick or disabled relatives, who come to bathe in a spring in the cave where Bernadette said she saw Mary, believing the water to have healing properties."
1034,作为组织者之一，蒂埃里·卡斯蒂略认为今年的集会“有点不寻常”，因为“恐吓似乎已经在法国生根”。,"Thierry Castillo, another of the organisers, described this year's gathering as ""a bit unusual"" given ""the threat that seems to have taken root in France."""
1035,不过，他确信地说：“这不会影响朝圣体验的质量和深度。”,"But ""it won't affect the quality and depth of what they experience,"" he assured."
1036,58岁的志愿者弗朗索瓦丝在帮助生病的朝圣者，她坦承觉得现场身着迷彩服的士兵“有点太多了”。,"Francoise, a 58-year-old volunteer who was assisting sick pilgrims, admitted she found the presence of soldiers in fatigues ""a little overwhelming."""
1037,不过，只要能让大家放心就好。,"But if it reassures everyone, it's good."
1038,萨拉戈萨购物中心枪击事件两人受伤,Two injured in Zaragoza shopping centre shooting
1039,一名男子在西班牙东北部城市萨拉戈萨的一家购物中心开枪，致使两人受重伤。,Two people have been seriously injured after a man opened fire at a shopping centre in Zaragoza in northeastern Spain.

1047,现居美国宾夕法尼亚州的葛兰是土耳其通缉的要犯。,"Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, is on Turkey's most-wanted list."
1048,恰武什奥卢表示，美国司法部的一个工作组将于本月晚些时候访问土耳其讨论引渡葛兰的可能性。,Cavosoglu said a U.S. Department of Justice team will visit Turkey later this month to discuss his possible extradition.
1049,这一问题已经成为美国与土耳其（北约组织成员国）双边关系中的障碍。,"The issue has become a problem for the United States in its dealings with Turkey, a NATO member."
1050,美国反对土耳其总统雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安在政变事件后采取的铁腕政策，而土耳其的回应是试图与俄罗斯发展更密切的关系。,"The United States has objected to the strong-arm tactics of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following the coup, and Turkey has responded by attempting to develop closer ties with Russia."
1051,恰武什奥卢表示，土耳其驻希腊的两位武官逃到了意大利，驻科威特的一位武官试图逃往沙特阿拉伯但被遣送回国，驻阿富汗的两位将军在迪拜被抓获并遣送回国。,"Cavosoglu said two Turkish military attaches in Greece fled to Italy, an attaché in Kuwait attempted to escape to Saudi Arabia but was sent back and two generals in Afghanistan were caught in Dubai and sent to Turkey."
1052,他补充道，两名驻孟加拉的公务人员逃往纽约，而一名驻俄罗斯的公务人员则去了日本。,"He added two civil servants in Bangladesh fled to New York, and one in Russia went to Japan."

1059,奥运会组织者尝试清洁绿色跳水池,Olympic officials try to clean green-tinged diving pool
1060,计划周五进行练习的奥运会跳水运动员在抵达时却发现水池被封闭了，因为奥运会组织者花费了较多的时间清洁略带绿色的池水以便为即将举行的里约奥运会首场个人比赛项目做准备。,Olympic divers planning to practice Friday arrived to a closed pool as officials took more time to clean the green-tinged water before holding the first individual event of the Rio Games.
1061,在周二举行双人跳水项目时，池水突然变色。,"The water suddenly changed color Tuesday, midway through the synchronized diving events."
1062,在相邻的用于水球和花样游泳比赛的更大泳池也略微泛绿之后，组织者仍坚称池水对于比赛而言是安全的。,"Officials insisted the water was safe for competing, even after a larger, adjacent pool used for water polo and synchronized swimming also turned a lighter shade of green."
1063,当运动员抵达准备进行上午的热身运动时，跳水池却被关闭了，尽管当地时间下午1点再度启用，此时距离女子3米板跳水比赛开始只剩两个半小时。,"The diving well was shut down when athletes arrived for morning warmups, though it did finally open at 1 p.m. local time - just 2 1/2 hours before the start of the women's 3-meter event."
1064,池水的颜色看起来接近正常了，但仍有一点绿。,The water color appeared to be closer to normal but was still shaded green.
1065,参加跳板项目比赛的美国跳水选手艾比·约翰斯顿表示，她去跳水池做热身练习时却获悉跳水池被关闭了，而且没有任何提前通知。,"American diver Abby Johnston, who is competing on the springboard, said she showed up for her warmup, only to learn the pool was shut down without any notice."
1066,她在推特上写道“#FixTheSwamp”应该开始趋势预测。,"She wrote on Twitter that ""#FixTheSwamp"" should start trending."
1067,双人跳台跳水比赛铜牌获得者英国运动员汤姆·戴利也在推特发帖对跳水池的状态进行了评论。,"British diver Tom Daley, who won bronze in the synchro platform event, also commented on the state of the pool in a Twitter post."
1068,希望那意味着未来数天里我们不会在太糟糕的池水里跳水！,Hopefully that means we haven't been diving in anything too bad the last couple of days!
1069,当地的赛事组织委员会首席发言人马里奥·安德拉达强调说，池水对于比赛而言是安全的，举行3米板预赛没有问题。,"Mario Andrada, chief spokesman for the local organizing committee, stressed that the pool was safe for competition, clearing the way for the 3-meter preliminaries."
1070,他承认有些运动员对池水感到担忧，但表示那是因为对跳水池进行清洁工作所致。,"He conceded that some athletes were bothered by the water, but said that was a result of efforts to clean the pool."
1071,他说：“我们重申一直以来的说法，这个池水不会对运动员的健康造成任何威胁。”,"""We reiterate what we have been saying all along - the water does not offer any threat to the health of the athletes,"" he said."
1072,在池水出现状况的当天，有一两名运动员抱怨说他们觉得眼睛发痒。,"In the first day of this water situation, one or two athletes complained about their eyes being itchy."
1073,这是因为当我们看到池水变绿时第一反应就是使用化学物质氯，这种化学物质在游泳池中的使用十分常见。,This was a result that the first reaction when we saw the water turning green was to use one of the chemicals - chlorine - that is very common in swimming pools.
1074,我们立即减少了用量。,We reduced immediately the quantity.
1075,我们重新检测了池水，结果表明各项指标完全在参数范围内。,We retested the water and it was totally within the parameters.
1076,玛利亚伦克游泳中心首席发言人西蒙·朗福德表示，关闭跳水池是为了进行额外的清洁作业。,"Simon Langford, chief spokesman for the Maria Lenk Aquatics Center, said the pool was closed to allow additional cleaning."
1077,他说这一决定获得了国际泳联的支持。,He said the decision was supported by world governing body FINA.
1078,朗福德在一份声明中表示：“关闭跳水池的原因是池水必须保持静止以便让跳水池能够尽快重回其蓝色状态。”,"""The reason is that the water must be still so the pool can return to its blue color as soon as possible,"" Langford said in a statement."
1079,安德拉达表示，组织者对水池恶化情况感到猝不及防。,Andrada said officials were caught off guard by the pool's deteriorating condition.
1080,他说：“化学并非一种精确科学。”,"""Chemistry is not an exact science,"" he said."
1081,如大家所见，一些事物要比预想的延续更长时间。,"Some things, as you can see, went longer than expected."
1082,过去几天下的雨甚至使让池水颜色恢复正常的工作变得更加困难。,Rain the past couple of days made it even tougher to get the water color back to normal.
1083,安德拉达表示：“下雨无助于改善情况。”,"""The rain doesn't help,"" Andrada said."
1084,他补充道，运动员上午可以进行陆上训练，不过承认这种安排“并不理想”。,"He added that athletes had access to dry-land training in the morning, but conceded that ""was not ideal."""
1085,他解释说，池水变色是碱性水平提升所致，与水族馆里的水在没有适当监控时可能变绿的情况类似。,"He explained that the changing color of the pool was the result of increased alkaline levels, much like aquarium water can turn green when not monitored properly."
1086,当我们前往解决池水变绿的问题时，对最佳化学物质进行过讨论。,"When we went to fix the green, there was a discussion about the best chemicals."
1087,安德拉达表示：“运动员正在池中训练，所以我们不能在水中使用太多化学物质。”,"We can't use too much chemicals in the water because athletes are training in it,"" Andrada said."
1088,当然我们起初就应把工作做得更好以防止池水变绿。,We certainly could have done better in the beginning to prevent the water from turning green.
1089,当池水变绿时，我们又犯了另一个错误。,"Once it turned green, we again made another bit of a mistake."

1129,总统引述20世纪70年代建成的坦赞铁路证明中国的慷慨支持，那时中国自己甚至也不繁荣。,The president cited the Tanzania-Zambia Railway built in the 1970s as an evidence of China's generous support even when China was by then not so prosperous itself.
1130,穆塞韦尼表示，中国与乌干达进行了多方面合作，从基础设施建设、商业投资到文化交流。他补充道，与简单地提供援助相比较，这种合作对乌干达的长期发展更有利。,"China has carried out multifaceted cooperation with Uganda, ranging from infrastructure and business investment to cultural exchanges, Museveni said, adding that such kind of cooperation is more conducive to Uganda's long-term development than simply providing aids."
1131,他希望中国可以通过各种途径参与乌干达的基础设施开发和产业园区建设。,"He hopes China can, through various ways, join in Uganda's infrastructural development and construction of industrial parks."
1132,他还欢迎更多中国人来乌干达投资和旅游。,He also welcomes more Chinese to invest and travel in Uganda.
1133,王毅称赞乌干达在工业化和农业现代化方面取得的进步，并表示，中国将一如既往地作为乌干达最可靠、最理想的合作伙伴。,"Wang Yi hailed the progress Uganda has made in industrialization and agricultural modernization, adding that China will continue to play the role of Uganda's most reliable and ideal cooperation partner."
1134,王毅表示，中国已准备好尽最大努力帮助乌干达追求经济与社会发展，强调中乌合作是真诚的，不附带任何政治条件，因为这种合作是建立在高度政治互信和长期友谊的基础之上。,"China stands ready to try its best in helping Uganda pursue economic and social development, Wang said, noting that Sino-Ugandan cooperation is sincere and without any political strings attached as it is based on high-level political trust and time-tested friendship."
1135,他说，中国将加强与乌干达在基础设施与产业园区建设方面的合作，并为该东非国家的能源与农业发展提供支持。,"He said China would strengthen its cooperation with Uganda on construction of infrastructure and industrial parks, and support the east African nation to develop its energy and agriculture sectors."
1136,在加利福尼亚州一个主要水务管理区披露州长杰瑞·布朗领导的行政当局将提供政府资金以完成两条巨型输水隧道的规划之后，有一些评论家和一位州议员表示，他们想进一步了解由谁来为州长所支持的拟耗资160亿美元的水务工程承担费用。,"Critics and a state lawmaker say they want more explanations on who's paying for a proposed $16 billion water project backed by Gov. Jerry Brown, after a leading California water district said Brown's administration was offering government funding to finish the planning for the two giant water tunnels."
1137,评论家表示，洛杉矶的MWD周四所提及的政府资金可能有悖于该州长期以来的承诺，该承诺说，为了实现布朗所设想的挖掘两条35英里长隧道，以便于把水从萨克拉门托河向南输送，并主要供应给加利福尼亚州中部和南部地区的愿景，各地方水管区（而非加利福尼亚州自身）将承担费用。,"Critics said the government funding described by the Los Angeles-based Metropolitan Water District on Thursday could run counter to long-standing state assurances that various local water districts, not California itself, would pay for Brown's vision of digging twin 35-mile-long tunnels to carry water from the Sacramento River south, mainly for Central and Southern California."
1138,这两条隧道的2.48亿美元初期费用支出尚未获得监管部门批准便已经成为一项正在进行的联邦审计的主题。,"The $248 million in preliminary spending for the tunnels, which have yet to win regulatory approval, already is the topic of an ongoing federal audit."
1139,一些州议员也于周三责令对隧道费用支出情况进行一次州内审计。,"On Wednesday, state lawmakers ordered a state audit of the tunnels-spending as well."
1140,该州的发言人南希·沃格尔周四表示，尽管该账户属于洛杉矶市政水管区，却不会动用该州的任何普通资金来完成这两条隧道当前规划阶段的工程。,"On Thursday, state spokeswoman Nancy Vogel said that despite the account of the Los Angeles-based Metropolitan Water District, no money from the state's general fund would be used finishing the current planning phase of the twin tunnels."
1141,不过，该隧道项目的反对者和一个纳税人团体周四提出批评，而且本周的审计命令幕后的州立法者之一州议会女议员苏珊·艾格曼则于周四要求该州政府澄清相关情况。,"However, opponents of the tunnels and a taxpayer group were critical Thursday, and Assemblywoman Susan Eggman, one of the state lawmakers behind this week's audit order, asked the state Thursday for clarification."
1142,霍华德贾维斯纳税人协会立法主任大卫·沃尔夫表示：“这是一场骗局。”,"""It's a shell game,"" said David Wolfe, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association's legislative director."
1143,我认为就昨天的审计（请求）来说：其中的问题远比答案多。,I think it comes back to the audit (request) yesterday: There are way more questions here than there are answers.
1144,拟建隧道的长期反对者、环境顾问帕特丽夏·斯彻斐勒表示：“项目承包商曾保证为该项目承担费用，他们却通过财务把戏规避了这项义务。”,"""Project contractors pledged to pay for this project and they've used financial gimmicks to get around this obligation,"" said Patricia Schifferle, an environmental consultant and longtime opponent of the proposed tunnels."
1145,于是，问题就在于究竟从哪里能落实这笔资金。,It raises questions as to where this money was suddenly found.
1146,企业集团就网络安全法向中国提诉求,Business Groups Appeal to China Over Cybersecurity Law
1147,一个由国际企业集团组成的联盟呼吁中国改变所提议的网络安全规则，并警告这些规则将损害贸易并使国家陷入孤立。,A coalition of international business groups has appealed to China to change proposed cybersecurity rules they warn will harm trade and isolate the country.
1148,来自美国、欧洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲的46家集团共同签署了致中国总理李克强的信函，这反映了对有关网络安全规则可能限制或阻止信息安全产品进入中国市场的全球关注程度。,"The letter to Chinese Premier Li Keqiang is signed by 46 groups from the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, reflecting the global scale of concern the rules might limit or cut off access to China's market for information security products."
1149,签名单位包括美国商会、欧洲服务业论坛以及来自日本、韩国和墨西哥的多家集团。,"Signers include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the European Services Forum and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico."
1150,中国所提议的网络安全规则将要求供应商向中国有关部门演示安全产品的工作方式，并要求在中国境内存储中国公民的信息。,The proposed rules would require providers to show Chinese authorities how security products work and to store information about Chinese citizens within the country.
1151,周三签发的最新信函指出，此举可能会使数据更易于失窃并可能减少对中国客户的访问。,"The latest letter, dated Wednesday, says that might make data theft easier and reduce access to Chinese customers."
1152,天津化学品爆炸：致命灾难一周年纪念,Tianjin chemical blast: Deadly disaster marked one year on
1153,张梦凡说公众应该了解天津爆炸事故中发生的事情,Zhang Mengfan says the public deserves to know what happened in the Tianjin blasts
1154,中国领导人或许想以无声的方式来纪念那场致使173人遇难的化学品大爆炸过去后的第一个周年，但并非每个人都这么想。,"China's leaders may want muted commemorations to mark the first anniversary of the massive chemical blast that killed 173 people, but not everyone agrees."
1155,请看约翰·苏德沃斯发自天津的报道。,John Sudworth reports from Tianjin.
1156,倘若这种量级的灾难发生在世界上任何一个其他地方，其周年纪念日几乎都会表现为全国性的深刻反省。,Almost anywhere else in the world the anniversary of a disaster of this magnitude would present a moment of national soul-searching.
1157,在中国却并非如此。,But not in China.
1158,当天津市正在为那些逝去的消防员举行纪念仪式时，其他地方举行的纪念活动却被低调处理。,"While a memorial service to some of the dead firefighters is being held in the city of Tianjin, elsewhere the tributes are being muted."
1159,共产党控制的媒体被告知什么可以讲以及什么不能讲，一些幸存者和逝者亲属则被告诫不要对外媒发声。,"The Communist Party-controlled media is being told what it can and cannot say and some survivors, as well as family members of the dead, are being warned not to speak to the foreign press."
1160,不过，23岁的张梦凡不愿保持沉默。,But 23-year-old Zhang Mengfan won't stay quiet.
1161,“在这个周年纪念日里，公众应该有一条途径了解所发生的事情，”他告诉我说。,"""On this anniversary there should be a way for the public to know what happened,"" he tells me."
1162,我不想沉默。,I don't want silence.
1163,去年8月12日，张先生是一个军队所属消防队的无线电话务员，其所在消防站距离爆炸中心只有一公里远。,"On 12 August last year, Mr Zhang was a radio operator with a military fire brigade, stationed just a kilometre from the epicentre of the explosions."
1164,他说：“电话是在晚上10:53打来的，然后我们就开始派遣我的队友。”,"""The call came in at 10:53 that night and we started to despatch my teammates,"" he says."
1165,他们赶到现场需要10分钟。,It would have taken them 10 minutes to get to the scene.
1166,来自该市其他地方的消防队员也陆续抵达，以应付一个化学品仓库发生的大火。,Other crews from elsewhere in the city were also arriving to tackle the large fire in a chemical storage depot.
1167,他们所有人可能都没有意识到现场违规存放着大量挥发性和有毒的物质，远远超出允许的量，并且未被正确管理。,"All of them would have been oblivious to the fact that large quantities of volatile and toxic substances were being illegally stored, way beyond permitted amounts and without proper management."
1168,当时一批硝化纤维（用于指甲油的一种化学用品）被允许进行干燥处理，然后在夏季高温下被点燃，引发了火灾。,The fire had started when a batch of nitrocellulose - a chemical used in nail polish - had been allowed to dry out and then ignited in the summer heat.
1169,随后，大火蔓延至储存有大量（800吨）硝酸铵化肥的区域。,It then spread to a huge stockpile - 800 tonnes - of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.
1170,随之而来的爆炸摧毁了消防站的窗户并导致屋顶塌陷，张梦凡当时正守候在无线电旁等待发自火灾现场的报告。,The resulting explosions shattered the windows and brought the roof in at the fire station where Zhang Mengfan was waiting by the radio for reports from the scene.
1171,然而那些报告再也不会来了。,Those reports never came in.
1172,“当看到蘑菇云时，我陷入了绝望，”他对我说道。,"""When I saw the mushroom cloud I fell into a state of desperation,"" he tells me."
1173,我知道它对我的朋友们而言意味着什么。,I knew what it would mean for my friends.
1174,那天晚上，他所在的消防站向火灾现场派遣了26名消防员，其中8人再也没有回来。,"Of the 26 firefighters sent to the blaze from his unit that night, eight never came back."
1175,幸存的消防员中有许多遭受了严重烧伤和其他损伤。,Many of the others suffered serious burns and other injuries.
1176,在两次大爆炸中，最大的那次爆炸被作为一次地震而观测到，爆炸冲击波在许多公里之外的地方仍能被感受到。,"The biggest of the two large explosions was measured as a seismic event, with a blast wave that was felt many kilometres away."
1177,灾难引起的总损失超过10亿美元，其中包括被损毁的300多栋建筑。,"The total cost of the damage was put at more than $1bn, including the 300-plus buildings that were destroyed."
1178,遇难者总计173人，其中104人是消防员。,A total of 173 people lost their lives - 104 of them firefighters.
1179,有8名遇难者的遗体一直没有找到。,Eight bodies have never been found.
1180,官方的政府调查结果把责任归咎于腐败、政治关系和官员勾结致使办事马虎和无视安全制度。,"An official government enquiry has laid the blame squarely at corruption, political connections and official collusion that allowed corners to be cut and safety systems to be overridden."
1181,该仓库当初就不应建造在距离住宅楼那么近的地方。,The storage depot should never have been built so close to residential buildings in the first place.
1182,有100多名官员和企业高管正面临某种违纪调查或刑事调查。,More than 100 officials and company executives are facing some kind of disciplinary or criminal investigation.
1183,因此，虽然政府可以指出所取得的进展，比如数千所住宅被修复，居民获得补偿，但仍有挥之不去的敏感问题。,So while the government can point to the progress that has been made - the thousands of homes repaired and the residents compensated - those lingering sensitivities remain.
1184,这场灾难暴露了一个系统的裂痕，在该系统中，经济快速增长被作为优先事项，而且缺乏独立监督是个不争的事实。,The disaster has exposed the cracks in a system where rapid economic growth is a priority and the lack of independent oversight is a fact of life.
1185,那个夜晚表现出的勇敢精神和责任感不可置疑，然而消防员作为英雄形象的侧面则是另一幅令人难受的画面。,"The bravery and sense of duty that night cannot be doubted and yet alongside the image of the firefighter as hero, there is the other uncomfortable picture."
1186,那是消防员作为受害者的画面，在没有正确认知的情况下，他们被派遣到一次本可避免的、人为的大灾难中。,"That of the firefighter as victim, sent without proper knowledge into an avoidable, man-made catastrophe."
1187,张梦凡现在已经离开了消防部门，但将会参加天津的纪念仪式。,Zhang Mengfan has now left the fire service but will attend the memorial service in Tianjin.
1188,他将在心里为逝去的战友们捎上一句话。,He will be carrying in his heart a message for his dead comrades.
1189,我最想告诉他们的是：我去看望了你们的父母，他们都很好。,What I want to tell them most is this: I've been to visit your parents and they are fine.
1190,把父母放心交给我。,Leave your parents to me.
1191,现在我就是你们的家人。,I am a member of your family now.
1192,我会为你们尽孝道。,I will fulfil your filial duty.
1193,寒冷春天可能影响苏格兰松鸡狩猎季节,Cold spring could affect Scottish grouse shooting season
1194,由于气候寒冷造成今年松鸡数量减少，苏格兰的松鸡狩猎季节将延迟开始。,"Scotland's grouse shooting season will begin later, with cold weather hitting bird numbers this year."
1195,因为许多早期的雏鸡未能在此次寒冷的春天中幸存下来，一些庄园已经将狩猎时间延后。,Several estates have postponed shooting as many of the early chicks did not survive the cool spring conditions.
1196,在为松鸡狩猎季节开幕致辞时，苏格兰猎场看护人协会表示，松鸡狩猎与爱丁堡各大节日相比能维持更多的工作机会。,"Marking the start of the season, the Scottish Gamekeepers Association (SGA) said grouse shooting sustained more jobs than the Edinburgh festivals."
1197,不过动物保护慈善组织OneKind呼吁终结对这些鸟禽的“残酷杀戮”。,"But animal protection charity OneKind called for an end to the ""brutal slaughter"" of the birds."
1198,该组织的主任哈利·海顿表示：“在猎场内维持丰富的鸟禽以供狩猎，这需要做大量工作，而且总是涉及一些极具争议性的做法。”,"The organisation's director Harry Huyton said: ""The effort which goes into maintaining a rich supply of game birds for shooting is huge and invariably involves some extremely controversial practices."""
1199,这就难怪公众正逐渐对这种所谓的运动方式持否定态度，并呼吁政府视其为供一些非常小众的苏格兰人取乐的一种残酷且没有必要的做法。,"It is not surprising the public is turning their back on this so-called sport and calling the government to account on a cruel, unnecessary practice which is enjoyed by a very small minority of people in Scotland."
1200,不过那些土地所有者坚持认为他们是在致力于保护，而且松鸡狩猎对于农村经济至关重要。,But landowners insisted they were committed to conservation and that grouse shooting was vital to the rural economy.
1201,苏格兰猎场看护人协会会长亚历克斯·霍格表示，该产业在偏远地区每年维持着8800份全职工作，而且成为一些不确定的时期里的“就业密集带”。,"The SGA's chairman, Alex Hogg, said the industry supported 8,800 full-time jobs per year in remote areas and was a ""rich seam of employment"" in uncertain times."
1202,他说：“与许多其他欧洲国家相比，苏格兰没有内生的‘狩猎’文化，许多人们不了解狩猎季节对这个国家的经济影响。”,"He said: ""Compared to many other European countries, Scotland does not have an embedded 'hunting' culture and chunks of the population don't know the impact the shooting seasons have to the country, economically."""
1203,霍格先生表示，依赖于狩猎的全职工作数量超过了由爱丁堡国际艺术节、边缘艺术节、分列式表演和除夕活动所创造的工作岗位的总和。,"Mr Hogg said the number of full-time jobs relying on shooting exceeded the posts created by the Edinburgh International Festival, the Fringe, Tattoo and Hogmanay combined."
1204,他补充说：“眼下苏格兰乡村地区对就业情况有着切实的担忧，尤其是在石油和天然气领域，因而猎场看护人及其家人都希望看到该行业的成长。”,"He added: ""There are real concerns for employment in rural Scotland at the moment, particularly in oil and gas, so gamekeepers and their families want to see the industry grow."
1205,我们想与苏格兰政府合作确保辛勤工作的人们可以在今后继续仰赖这些工作岗位。,We want to work with the Scottish government to make sure hard working people can continue to rely on these posts in future.
1206,英国皇家鸟类保护协会相信在松鸡猎场周边有八只金雕被非法猎杀。,RSPB Scotland believes that eight golden eagles have been killed illegally around grouse moors
1207,许多猎场看护人承认松鸡狩猎并非普遍受欢迎，但是苏格兰猎场看护人协会表示该产业已经“在最佳实践方面取得了显著进步”。,"Many gamekeepers acknowledge that grouse shooting is not universally popular, but the SGA said the industry had made ""significant strides in terms of best practice."""
1208,松鸡狩猎季节的开幕日传统上称为“辉煌的十二号”。,"The opening day of the grouse shooting season is traditionally known as the ""Glorious Twelfth."""
1209,不过，该消遣活动仍存在争议，松鸡狩猎场的管理层已经被一些野生生物保护组织打上迫害猛禽的标签。,"However, the sport remains controversial and the management of grouse shooting moors has been linked to the persecution of raptors by some wildlife bodies."
1210,周四，英国皇家鸟类保护协会表示，在不到五年时间里，有八只带标签的金雕在位于因弗内斯市东南方的莫纳利亚山脉失踪了。,"On Thursday, RSPB Scotland said eight tagged golden eagles had disappeared in the Monadhliath mountains, south-east of Inverness, in less than five years."
1211,该野生生物慈善机构相信，这些金雕在松鸡狩猎场周边被非法猎杀，而它们的卫星追踪标签则被销毁。,The wildlife charity believes they were killed illegally around grouse moors and their satellite tracking tags destroyed.
1212,苏格兰环境大臣罗莎娜·坎宁安表示，这些报告“非常令人不安且令人失望”。,"Scottish Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said the reports were ""very disturbing and disappointing."""
1213,坎宁安女士已责令相关官员对大约90只幸存及失踪的带标签的鹰的迹象进行分析，以确定是否存在某种模式的可疑活动。,"Ms Cunningham has ordered officials to analyse the evidence of about 90 surviving and missing eagles with the tags, to determine if there is a pattern of suspicious activity."
1214,苏格兰狩猎场集团指责皇家鸟类保护协会试图在松鸡狩猎季节来临之前掀起反狩猎的情绪，并表示没有任何确切证据表明这些猛禽其实是死在了莫纳利亚地区。,The Scottish Moorland Group accused the RSPB of trying to whip up anti-shooting feelings ahead of the grouse season and said there was no clear evidence of the birds having even died in the Monadhliath area.
1215,2016年里约奥运会：布若尼·佩奇为英国摘得蹦床银牌,Rio Olympics 2016: Bryony Page wins trampoline silver for Great Britain
1216,英国的佩奇在蹦床项目中夺得银牌,GB's Page wins silver in the trampolining
1217,布若尼·佩奇里约摘银，成为首位获得奥运会蹦床奖牌的英国女运动员。,Bryony Page became the first British woman to win an Olympic trampoline medal by claiming silver in Rio.
1218,现年25岁的佩奇在赛中的成绩比金牌得主低0.425分，加拿大选手罗珊娜·麦克伦南则以56.465分的成绩蝉联奥运会冠军。,"Page, 25, was beaten to gold by 0.425 points as Canada's Rosannagh MacLennan won a second successive Olympic title with a score of 56.465."
1219,中国选手、世界冠军李丹摘得铜牌，而另一名英国选手凯瑟琳·德里斯科尔取得了第六名。,"World champion Li Dan of China took bronze, while Britain's other finalist, Katherine Driscoll, came sixth."
1220,我无法相信自己获得了奥运会奖牌。,I can't believe I've won an Olympic medal.
1221,“我真的很开心。”佩奇十分激动地表示。,"I'm just so happy,"" said a clearly emotional Page."
1222,我没想到能获得奖牌，但我发挥了自己的最佳水平，所以我很开心，所有的训练和艰苦努力都取得了回报。,"I had no idea it was a medal but my performance was the best I could have done, that is why I was so happy, that all the training and hard work had paid off."
1223,我很高兴能与凯瑟琳一起进入决赛，只要一名选手晋级决赛就创造了历史，而我们有两名。,"I am so happy I got to share the final with Kat, one person would have been history and we got two."
1224,每个人都应该有第二次机会。,Everyone should have a second chance.
1225,当你开车并收到一张罚单时，没有人会把你关进监狱。,"When you drive and you are just issued a ticket, no-one puts you in jail."
1226,本·普劳德发力50米自由泳决赛,Ben Proud powers to 50m freestyle final
1227,稍早的时候，本·普劳德以打破英国纪录的成绩晋级男子50米自由泳决赛。,"Earlier, Ben Proud set a British record to reach the men's 50m freestyle final."
1228,21岁的英联邦运动会冠军普劳德游出了21.54秒的成绩，以排名第五的资格晋级周五的决赛（英国夏令时周六凌晨02:44）。,"Commonwealth champion Proud, 21, swam a time of 21.54 seconds to qualify fifth fastest for Friday's final (02:44 BST Saturday)."
1229,你们的代表团既粗鲁又无礼,Your delegation is pushy and rude
1230,印度体育部长维贾伊·戈尔在里约奥运会上分外显眼，经常出现在看台上为印度运动员加油并在赛后进行自拍。,"India's sports minister, Vijay Goel, has been a conspicuous presence at Rio's Olympic Games, frequently spotted in the stands cheering on Indian athletes and taking selfies after their events."
1231,不过，据印度报业托拉斯报道，他和众多随行人员的不守规矩的行为显然引起了奥运会官员的愤怒，他们在不出示适当凭据的情况下试图强行闯入比赛区域，并且在被检查时语言粗鲁。,"But he and his large entourage have apparently raised the ire of Olympic officials with unruly behavior, repeatedly trying to push their way into competition zones without the proper credentials and responding rudely when checked, the Press Trust of India reported."
1232,维贾伊·戈尔（照片拍摄于七月）为其行为作了辩解。,"Vijay Goel, pictured in July, has defended his behaviour."
1233,周三，在戈尔及其随行人员试图闯入体操赛场的禁区以及击剑和跆拳道的赛场之后，奥运会组织者致信警告称若戈尔再不做出改进就要撤销其参会资格。,"On Wednesday, Olympic organizers threatened to withdraw Goel's accreditation if the behavior did not improve, sending a warning letter after he and his entourage tried to enter restricted areas in the gymnastics venue and the arena where fencing and taekwondo is held."
1234,2016年里约奥组委大陆经理莎拉·彼得森在信中写道：“我们多次接到报告称你们的体育部长试图携带未经授权的人员闯入要求经过授权才能进入的赛场区域。”,"""We have had multiple reports of your Minister for Sports trying to enter accredited areas at venues with unaccredited individuals,"" Sarah Peterson, continental manager of the Rio 2016 Organizing Committee wrote in the note."
1235,工作人员汇报称，当他们试图解释这种情况不被允许时，部长一行人员变得好斗和粗鲁并数次推搡工作人员强闯。,"When the staff tried to explain that this is not allowed, they reported that the people with the Minister have become aggressive and rude and sometimes pushed past our staff."
1236,信中接着写道：“如果我们的礼仪团队再度获悉出现此类行为，贵方体育部长的参会资格将被取消，而且他在奥运会上的特权也将被撤销。”,"""Should our protocol team be made aware of further examples of this type of behavior, the accreditation of your Minister for Sports will be cancelled and his privileges at the Olympic Games withdrawn,"" the letter continued."
1237,印度代表团团长称该事件为“原本不是问题却被当作了问题”，戈尔本人则表示他没有做错任何事情并将其归结为“误会”。,"The leader of the Indian delegation called the matter ""a non-issue being made an issue"" and Goel himself said he had done nothing wrong, chalking it up to a ""misunderstanding."""
1238,他在推特上说：“就我所知，我们一向遵从所有的规则和规定。”,"He tweeted, ""To my knowledge, we have been following all rules &amp; regulations."
1239,我们致力于奥林匹克精神并支持我们印度的选手。,We are committed to the spirit of Olympics &amp; back our Indian players.
1240,不然的话，这对于印度而言就是一场令人沮丧的奥运会，截至目前尚未有奖牌进账。,"Otherwise it's been a gloomy Olympics for India, with zero medals so far."
1241,失望的粉丝们在社交媒体上说，迈克尔·菲尔普斯现已经获得26枚奖牌，和印度历史上所取得奖牌的总数一样多。,Bummed-out fans on social media noted that Michael Phelps now has as many medals - 26 - as India has won in its history.
1242,几位知名的参赛选手已经被淘汰，其中包括射击运动员阿比纳夫·宾德拉，他是2008年北京奥运会的金牌获得者。,"Several prominent contenders have already been eliminated, including shooter Abhinav Bindra who won a gold medal in Beijing in 2008."
1243,本届奥运会上他取得了第四名。,He placed fourth this time.
1244,作家兼专栏作家绍哈·德发推特讥讽道：“真是浪费钱和机会。”,"What a waste of money and opportunity,"" author and columnist Shobhaa De said in a sardonic tweet."
1245,不过，随着参赛选手们在拳击、高尔夫、网球、田径当然还有羽毛球等项目上争金夺银，仍然有一些光明的希望。,"But some bright hopes remain, with competitors foraging ahead in boxing, golf, tennis, track and field and, yes, badminton."
1246,独自参赛的印度女子体操选手迪帕·卡玛卡将于周日参加跳马决赛，炫耀她那令人敬畏的翻腾两周的“死亡之跳”，其他运动员极少尝试做这种普娃跳动作。,"The lone Indian woman gymnast, Dipa Karmakar, will compete in the vault finals on Sunday - showing off her fearsome double revolution ""Vault of Death,"" the Produnova, attempted by few other gymnasts."
1247,对于一个拥有12.5亿人口的国家而言，印度的奖牌数之低总是令人惊愕。,"For a country of 1.25 billion people, India's low medal count has always been a source of consternation."
1248,分析家表示导致这种现象的原因有很多。,Analysts say that there are myriad reasons for this.
1249,风靡印度的运动项目是板球，可板球不是奥运会项目。,"The national obsession is cricket, which is not an Olympic sport."
1250,印度在奥运会选手的基础建设和训练上投入不大，卡玛卡使用的首个跳马器械竟是用一辆旧摩托车的零件做成的。,India has not invested heavily in infrastructure and training for Olympians - Karmakar's first vault was made from parts of an old scooter.
1251,家长们传统上更加重视学业而非体育。,Parents have historically emphasized academics over sport.
1252,而且体育管理机构一直饱受腐败的困扰。,And the sports' governing bodies have been dogged by corruption.
1253,印度奥林匹克协会2012年违背奥委会章程选出了背负刑事指控的领导，国际奥委会暂停了该协会的资格。,The International Olympic Committee suspended the Indian Olympic Association for violations of its charter in 2012 because they had elected leaders with pending criminal charges.
1254,在索契冬奥会上，印度的三名选手甚至未被允许代表国家、携带国旗和佩戴徽章而参赛。,"In Sochi, India's three winter Olympians were not even allowed to compete for their country, carry the flag or wear the insignia."
1255,他们只能作为独立身份的运动员参加冬奥会。,They competed as independents.
1256,从波士顿飞往萨克拉门托的捷蓝航空航班因遭遇湍流致人员受伤降落在南达科他州,Injuries force turbulence-rocked Boston-Sacramento JetBlue flight to land in South Dakota
1257,据哥伦比亚广播公司在萨克拉门托的报道，一架捷蓝航空班机周四晚上遭遇湍流，有22名乘客和两名机组人员受伤，被迫紧急降落。,"A JetBlue plane was forced to make an unexpected landing Thursday evening after 22 passengers and two crew members were injured during turbulence, reports CBS Sacramento."
1258,从波士顿飞往萨克拉门托的429号航班于当地时间傍晚将近7:30时在南达科他州拉皮德城降落。,"Flight 429, from Boston to Sacramento, landed in Rapid City, South Dakota shortly before 7:30 p.m. local time."
1259,该航班表示，受伤人员被送至一家医院做检查。,The airline says the injured were transported to a hospital for evaluation.
1260,捷蓝航空表示已调派人员为伤员提供协助，一架替代的飞机已飞往拉皮德城将其余乘客搭载至萨克拉门托。,"JetBlue says it sent personnel to assist the injured, and a replacement aircraft was flown to Rapid City to take the rest of the passengers on to Sacramento."
1261,缉毒局错失解禁医用大麻的机会,DEA's missed opportunity on medical marijuana
1262,答案是令人难过的：不太可能。,The answer sadly is: unlikely.
1263,这是一种错失的机会，可能进一步拖延无数人所需的潜在治疗法。,And this is a missed opportunity that could further delay potential therapies to countless people.
1264,截至今日，仅有一个经联邦政府批准的研究级医用大麻的来源，在密西西比大学。,"Up until today, there has been only one federally approved source of research-grade medical marijuana, at the University of Mississippi."
1265,今天有条看似积极的消息，缉毒局宣布该局现在也将允许其他地方申请批准类似做法。,"In a bit of seemingly positive news today, the DEA also announced it will now allow other places to apply for permission to do the same."
1266,希望在于，用于科学研究的大麻可能在数量和品种上都会扩大。,The hope is that marijuana available for scientific study could grow in both amount and diversity.
1267,虽然此举会被誉为研究领域的胜利，它主要是象征性的，因为不论有多少大麻可供使用，如果仍难以获取，就没什么意义。,"While this will be hailed as a victory for research, it will largely be symbolic, because no matter how much marijuana is available, if access is still difficult, it hardly matters."
1268,想象一下，一种产品虽然有着大量需求却仍被锁在门后。,Imagine a product that is in high demand but kept behind a locked door.
1269,作为对这种产品需求的响应，某人作出一个莫名其妙的决定，那就是制造更多产品但仍然不打开那扇锁住的门。,"In response to the demand for the product, someone makes a baffling decision to make more of it but still never unlocks the door."
1270,大麻就是这种产品，而大麻被指定为一类管制物质就是那扇锁住的门。,"Marijuana is that product, and its Schedule I designation is that locked door."
1271,这就是医用大麻的困境。,That is the predicament of medical marijuana.
1272,由于大麻属于一类管制物质（意味着按照规定它“目前没有受认可的医用目的并具有很高滥用潜力”），为了打开这扇门仍需克服不少重要的障碍。,"Because marijuana is a Schedule I substance (meaning that by definition it has ""no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse""), there are significant hurdles to getting the door unlocked."
1273,可能有需要的研究人员通常首先要去缉毒局，因为需要该部门为启动科学研究授予许可证。,"Potential researchers typically go to the DEA first, as it grants the license to begin scientific research."
1274,即使在被授予许可证之后，为了研究一类管制物质，研究机构必须安装重型保险柜和高级安全系统，这需要不菲的花费。,"Even if a license is granted, to study a Schedule I substance, institutions must have heavy-duty safes and high-grade security systems installed, which can be expensive."
1275,另外还有更主观的考虑，即首先要从你所在的学术机构获得批准才可以对一类管制物质开展研究。,There is also the more subjective consideration of getting approval from your academic institution to do the research on a Schedule I status substance in the first place.
1276,即使个别教师想要进行此类研究，大学领导层可能不希望带来负面报道引起的麻烦或潜在影响。,"Even if individual faculty members want to do that research, the university leadership may not want the hassle or the potential fallout of bad press."
1277,亚利桑那大学就出现过这样的情况，当时苏·希思黎博士在寻求进行一次医用大麻试验之后被解聘。,This happened at the University of Arizona when Dr. Sue Sisley was let go after trying to pursue a medical marijuana trial.
1278,希思黎最后不得不为其项目寻求私人资助，就在四月，离该研究项目最初拟定的时间已过去七年，她的试验项目成为首个获得缉毒局批准用于研究退伍军人创伤后应激障碍治疗的医用大麻试验。,"Sisley eventually had to find private funding for her project, and just in April, seven years after the study was initially proposed, hers became the first DEA approved medical marijuana trial for post-traumatic stress in veterans."
1279,然后，在遭受数年的制度性障碍之后，美国国家药物滥用研究所拿到了开锁的最后一把钥匙。,"Then, after years of bureaucratic hurdles, it is the National Institute on Drug Abuse that has held the final key to the lock."
1280,如今，它成为资助大麻研究的最大的联邦公共基金，并且是大麻本身的唯一供应商。,"Today, it is the biggest federal public funder of marijuana research and has been the sole supplier of the marijuana itself."
1281,即使现在有更多医用大麻被解放以供研究之用，该机构仍将不得不对其资助的任何研究进行审批。,"Even if more medical marijuana will now be freed up for research, the institute will still have to approve any studies it funds."
1282,不过，问题是它名字中的最后一个词：“滥用”。,"The problem, however, is that last word in its name: ""abuse."""
1283,在我为纪录片《杂草》对旧金山大学的唐纳德·亚伯兰斯进行访谈时，他说该研究所的一项主要职责是研究潜在滥用物质而非作为药物来研究。,"According to Dr. Donald Abrams at the University of San Francisco, whom I interviewed for my documentary ""Weed,"" the institute has a primary mandate to study substances for potential abuse rather than as a medicine."
1284,亚伯兰斯一语中的。,Abrams makes an important point.
1285,即使一项研究客服了上述所有阻碍，只要其研究目的不是医用大麻的害处而是其益处，那么这扇阻隔之门可能仍未开启。,"Even if a study does cross all the hurdles described above, the door may stay locked if the intent is to study the benefits of medical marijuana as opposed to the harm."
1286,想想这点：在对美国国家医学图书馆进行的一次（诚然非科学的）快速搜索表明，在过去五年里有1434篇有关医用大麻的论文。,"Consider this: A quick (and admittedly non-scientific) search through the U.S. National Library of Medicine pulled up 1,434 papers on medical marijuana over the past five years."
1287,那次搜索的结果还揭示，仅有57篇论文涉及医用大麻的益处。,That same search revealed only 57 papers on medical marijuana benefits.
1288,大多数论文研究大麻的害处，例如《大麻的神经讯号传导阻断效应引起的糟糕经历》、《大麻诱发胰腺炎》和《大麻的使用与肺癌的风险》。,"The vast majority were research into the harm of marijuana, such as ""Bad trip due to anticholinergic effect of cannabis,"" ""Cannabis induced pancreatitits"" and ""Marijuana use and risk of lung cancer."""
1289,这种不平衡现象反映出一种高度失真的画面。,That imbalance paints a highly distorted picture.
1290,通往医用大麻研究的道路由随处可见惊喜和虚伪所铺就。,The road to medical marijuana research is paved with surprises and hypocrisy nearly everywhere you look.
1291,就在缉毒局继续坚守一类管制物的分类并认为没有任何医学利益的同时，美国卫生与公众服务部却持有一项关于大麻的广泛药用用途的专利。,"While the DEA continues to dig in on Schedule I status, deeming no medical benefit, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services simultaneously holds a patent on cannabinoids for a wide range of medicinal purposes."
1292,缉毒局继续将大麻与海洛因和摇头丸共同列为高滥用潜力药物，尽管缉毒局自己的前首席行政法官弗兰西斯·杨并不认可这一点。,"The DEA continues to place marijuana alongside heroin and LSD as drugs with high abuse potential even though the DEA's own former chief administrative law judge, Francis Young, disagreed with this."
1293,在严格的医学条件下，大麻比我们日常消费的许多食物都要安全得多。,In strict medical terms marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly consume.
1294,例如，生吃10个土豆可导致毒性反应。,"For example, eating 10 raw potatoes can result in a toxic response."
1295,相比之下，就人的身体条件而言，不可能吃下多到足以致死的大麻。,"By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat enough marijuana to induce death."
1296,自然形态的大麻是人类所知的最安全的治疗活性物质之一。,Marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man.
1297,通过任何理性分析来衡量，在受监护的医疗护理常规程序范围内大麻都可以被安全使用。,By any measure of rational analysis marijuana can be safely used within the supervised routine of medical care.
1298,再强调一次，这是缉毒局自己的一名法官的意见。,"Again, that was from a judge with the DEA itself."
1299,然而将近30年过去了，几乎毫无改观。,"And yet nearly 30 years later, little has changed."
1300,不论我们是否意识到这一点，我们在日常生活中都会接受某种程度的虚伪。,"Whether we realize it or not, we all accept a certain amount of hypocrisy in our daily lives."
1301,或许我们总是没有力量去承认，或者我们是如此默然无语和目瞪口呆，以致于似乎无人注意得到。,Maybe we don't always have the energy to call it out or we are too speechless and dumbfounded that no one else seems to have noticed.
1302,不过，对于联邦医用大麻政策的虚伪性而言，这值得我们鼓起勇气不折不挠地摆明事实。,"With regard to the hypocrisy of federal medical marijuana policy, however, it is worth summoning the stamina to relentlessly present the facts."
1303,病人的生活仰赖于它，例如需要通过医用大麻缓解癫痫病情的夏洛特·菲吉以及许许多多其他病患。,"The lives of patients -- such as that of Charlotte Figi, whose seizures abated with the use of medical marijuana, and so many others -- depend on it."
1304,有一种植物，它能提供如此多的利益，却仍然被禁锢在这些上了锁的门后，这值得大家去讨论。,That a plant could provide so much benefit and still remain behind these locked doors is worth speaking up about.
1305,血腥甜菜根：唐纳德·特朗普是“金发的贝卢斯科尼”,Bloody Beetroots: Donald Trump 'a blonde Berlusconi'
1306,血腥甜菜根以电子舞曲而知名,The Bloody Beetroots is known for electronic dance music
1307,这些音乐家表示，特朗普就像贝卢斯科尼一样具有媒体主导优势,The musicians say Trump's dominance of the media is similar to Berlusconi's
1308,电子舞蹈朋克组合血腥甜菜根的创始人里福对美国有线电视新闻网表示：“要知道，意大利曾经是贝卢斯科尼当政，对我而言，特朗普就像是金头发的贝卢斯科尼。”,"""You know, we used to have Berlusconi in Italy and to me, Trump looks like a blonde Berlusconi,"" Rifo, who is the founder of electro-dance punk formation, The Bloody Beetroots, told CNN."
1309,这位共和党总统候选人和那位意大利媒体大亨出身的政治家均因其超群的个性，吸引媒体关注的技巧和在媒体上叙述故事的能力而闻名。,"The Republican presidential nominee and the Italian media mogul turned politician are both known for their larger than life personalities, their skills in capturing the attention of the press and shaping narratives in the media."
1310,正如血腥甜菜根一样，里福因其电子舞曲而知名，他在2013年与包括传奇人物保罗·麦卡特尼爵士和电子乐流行歌手葛丽泰·斯瓦伯·比彻在内的艺术家合作创作了歌曲《堕落爱情编年史》。,"As the Bloody Beetroots, Rifo is known for his electronic dance music and has collaborated with artists from the legendary Sir Paul McCartney to electro-pop singer Greta Svabo Bech in the 2013 song, ""Chronicles of a Fallen Love."""
1311,里福于1977年出生于意大利威尼斯郊外的小镇巴萨诺，朋克摇滚乐也大约是在那个时期诞生，这位音乐家把数字“1977”纹在了胸口。,"Rifo was born in the Italian town of Bessano del Grappa outside Venice in 1977, which is around the time punk rock was born, and the numbers ""1977"" are tattooed across the musician's chest."
1312,里福戴着他那象征性的黑色口罩说道：“英语不是我的母语，因此我不了解你们国家的事情。”,"""English is not my main language so I don't understand everything about your world,"" Rifo said from behind a black mask, which he is known for."
1313,我尝试去探究，而且我一直在努力提高自己对你们的文化的理解力。,I try to explore and I've been trying to improve my understanding of your culture.
1314,里福力荐美国人观看《电视政治》，这是一部探究贝卢斯科尼对意大利媒体实施垄断控制的纪录片。,"Rifo urged Americans to watch ""Videocracy,"" a documentary which explores Berlusconi's monopoly over the Italian media."
1315,里福说，该纪录片介绍“贝卢斯科尼如何使意大利陷入疯狂”，并补充说特朗普对美国也有类似效应。,"The documentary is about ""how Berlusconi used to drive Italy crazy,"" Rifo said, adding that Trump has had a similar effect on America."
1316,他说：“你们能看到一个人如何能彻底颠倒乾坤和扭曲一切……随心所欲。”,"""You see the way a man can completely invert the system and curve everything ... for his wants,"" he said."
1317,在我看来，特朗普对这个国家而言并不是什么好事。,"Trump, to me, looks like something that is not good for this country."
1318,两名土耳其水手因走私5亿英镑毒品在缉毒行动中被捕入狱,Two Turkish sailors jailed over £500 million drugs bust
1319,两名土耳其男子被控在北海用船走私价值5亿英镑可卡因，分别被判入狱至少20年。,Two Turkish men convicted of smuggling £500 million worth of cocaine on board a ship in the North Sea have each been jailed for at least 20 years.
1320,在距离阿伯丁海岸约100英里的哈马尔号商船内发现3吨A类毒品之后，穆敏·沙欣和艾敏·奥兹曼在格拉斯哥高等法院的审判中被判有罪。,Mumin Sahin and Emin Ozmen were found guilty after a trial at the High Court in Glasgow after three tonnes of the Class A drug were discovered inside the MV Hamal about 100 miles off the coast of Aberdeen.
1321,据悉，2015年的这次缉毒行动查获的是欧洲有史以来发现的海上可卡因运输案件中单宗案值最大的案件。,The 2015 seizure is said to be the biggest single cocaine haul ever recovered at sea in Europe.
1322,穆敏·沙欣和艾敏·奥兹曼因参与巨额毒品交易而被捕入狱,Mumin Sahin and Emin Ozmen have been jailed for their role in a huge drug deal
1323,在船上缴获的毒品数量之大堪称英国史上最大贩毒案之一,The massive haul of drugs found on the boat is one of the biggest in British history
1324,运毒用的船舶是在坦桑尼亚注册的拖船，航线是从伊斯坦布尔到特内里费，然后到北海，毒品藏匿在专门改装过的隐秘船舱里。,"The drugs were found hidden in a specially-adapted secret hold in the Tanzanian-registered tugboat, which was sailing from Istanbul to Tenerife and then to the North Sea."
1325,该走私船被皇家海军HMS Somerset号护卫舰和边防卫队HMC Valiant号武装快艇拦截。,It was stopped by the Royal Navy frigate HMS Somerset and Border Force cutter HMC Valiant.
1326,格拉斯哥高等法院判处47岁的沙欣22年监禁，判处51岁的奥兹曼20年监禁。,"Sahin, 47, was sentenced to 22 years while Ozmen, 51, was handed down a 20-year term at the High Court in Glasgow."
1327,法官洛德·金克雷文对两名罪犯说，毒品的数量“与其说较大不如说巨大”，而且贩卖毒品对大众和社会都有‘毁灭性影响’。,Judge Lord Kinclaven told the men the quantity of drugs was 'not only significant but massive' and drugs trafficking had a 'devastating impact' on people and communities.
1328,法官表示：“你们用船进行可卡因的跨国贩运，事实上也是跨洲贩运，犯下了一桩最严重的商业规模的罪行。”,"He said: 'You were involved in a most serious operation of commercial scale involving the transportation of cocaine by ship, in an operation which crossed international and indeed intercontinental boundaries.'"
1329,法官告诉船长沙欣，他“并非处于贩毒树形结构的顶端”，却在犯罪中起着重要作用，而副船长奥兹曼所起的作用“在某种程度上稍轻”。,"He told the ship's captain Sahin, he was 'not at the top of the drugs tree' but had played an important role in the offence, while second captain Ozmen's role was 'to some extent a lesser one'."
1330,登上哈马尔号拖船的官员得到了法国国家海关情报调查局的密报，该船在阿伯丁靠岸后，他们钻透一块钢板找到一个隐秘船舱，发现128包可卡因，重3.2吨，估计街头黑市价值约为5.12亿英镑。,"Officers boarded the Hamal following a tip-off from French customs body DNRED, and once it was docked in Aberdeen they drilled through a steel plate into a secret compartment to find 128 bales of cocaine weighing 3.2 tonnes, with an estimated street value of £512 million."
1331,皇家海军去年对哈马尔号母船进行过登船检查。,MV Hamal was boarded by the Royal Navy last year.
1332,船上有三顿可卡因。,Three tonnes of cocaine was onboard
1333,在被突击检查时，该船的压载舱里塞满了数吨重的A类毒品,Tonnes of the Class-A drug were crammed in the ship's ballast tank when it was raided
1334,该船在从博斯普鲁斯驶向南美洲的途中在北海被截停,The ship went from the Bosporus to South America before being stopped in the North Sea
1335,在一间船员宿舍的衣柜下找到了毒品隐藏空间的入口，开口处被水泥封堵。,"The entry to the space was found under a wardrobe in one of the crew's quarters, with the opening cemented over."
1336,沙欣和奥兹曼因在去年2月20日到4月23日期间在该船上携带和藏匿可卡因并在4月21日到4月23日期间涉嫌贩卖可卡因而被判有罪。,"Sahin and Ozmen were found guilty of being concerned with the carrying and concealing of cocaine on the ship between February 20 and April 23 last year, and of being concerned in the supply of cocaine between April 21 and April 23."
1337,这两人自学业结束之后就一直从事船运行业，均系初犯，他们接受陪审团的裁定但仍坚称清白。,"The men, both first offenders who have worked in the shipping industry since leaving school, continue to maintain their innocence but accept the jury's verdict."
1338,对另外四名男子的指控最终发现查无实据。,Charges against four other men were found not proven.
1339,沙欣的律师乔纳森·克罗表示，这名已婚且膝下有二子的父亲是个“光荣的骡子”（为毒贩效劳的跑腿送货人）。,"Sahin's lawyer, Jonathan Crowe, said the married father-of-two was a 'glorified mule'."
1340,他表示：“有人被卷入了毒品的运输。”,He said: 'Someone who was involved in the transportation of the drugs.'
1341,一个能指挥船的人。,Someone who was able to captain a boat.
1342,就毒贩的层级结构而言，沙欣先生肯定不是处于贩毒树形结构的顶端，而是处于较低级的层次。,"In regard to the drugs hierarchy, Mr Sahin is certainly not at the top of the drugs tree but somewhere further down."
1343,船上装载的可卡因的绝对数量意味着这些毒品必须用起重机来搬运,The sheer amount of cocaine on the ship meant they had to be removed by a crane
1344,在这些毒品被分装到这些盒子里之前，警方花了数天时间对该船进行了详细检查。,Police spent days going through the boat before the drugs were divided into these boxes
1345,法庭听证时获悉，沙欣于2015年2月被提名作为哈马尔号拖船的船长。,"Sahin was approached about captaining the Hamal in February 2015, the court heard."
1346,克罗先生表示，沙欣对于要错过9岁女儿和13岁儿子的重要成长阶段感到“悲痛欲绝”并且“一心想回到土耳其的家里”。,"Mr Crowe said he is 'devastated' about missing out on milestones for his daughter, nine, and son, 13, and 'just wants to go home to Turkey'."
1347,自从2015年4月被拘留之后，这两名男子就没有见过他们的家人，而他们的家人在为争取签证获得批准而奔波。,Both men have not seen their families since being taken into custody in April 2015 as their families struggle to get visa approval.
1348,奥兹曼的律师迪·穆尔表示，奥兹曼“极为渴望”见到他的家人，但清楚这在可以预见的未来仍属“奢望”。,"Ozmen's lawyer, Di Moore, said he is 'desperate' to see his family but knows that will 'remain impossible' for the foreseeable future."
1349,在今天宣判之后进行发言时，苏格兰王室代理检察官戴维·哈维表示：“国际毒品交易不分国界。本着废除毒品交易的天职，我们正在密切合作以确保占据优势。”,"Speaking following today's sentencing, Scotland's Crown Agent prosecutor David Harvie said: 'The international drugs trade does not respect borders, and those of us whose job it is to dismantle it are working ever-closer together to ensure we stay one step ahead."
1350,“苏格兰追捕罪犯的范围真正做到了覆盖全球，在本案中，我们对有组织犯罪给予了重大经济打击。”,'Scotland's reach in pursuing criminals is on a truly global scale and in this case we have dealt a substantial economic blow to organised criminals.'
1351,这艘船上的每一个舱室都堆放了毒品，其中包括甲板下方的空间。,"Drugs were packed into every cavity in the boat, including under the floors"
1352,这包违禁品被稽查官员发现藏匿在船的洗衣房里,This package of contraband was found hidden in the ship's laundry room by officers
1353,哈维先生补充说：“哈马尔号拖船的案件根据法国有关部门提供的密报而破获，并得到了该船注册地坦桑尼亚检察总长的快速配合，才得以登船检查。”,"Mr Harvie added:'The Hamal was identified after an intelligence tip-off from French authorities, and swift co-operation from the Attorney General in Tanzania where the ship was registered allowed it to be boarded."
1354,“我们在圭亚那获得了关键的船运记录，然后我们的调查从圭亚那延伸到西班牙，在那里我们了解到该船在加那利群岛经停的重要信息。”,"'Our investigation then stretched from Guyana, who provided access to crucial shipping records, to Spain, who gave us crucial information on the ship's stop-offs in the Canary Islands."
1355,我们还与丹麦、挪威和美国的同行合作，将具体的证据要素拼合在一起。,"We also worked with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the United States to piece specific elements of the evidence together."
1356,尽管有可靠情报表明哈马尔号正携带有大量毒品，但在未经坦桑尼亚政府允许的情况下，英国有关部门不能在国际水域登船检查，而坦桑尼亚政府此前从未进行过此类授权。,"Despite strong intelligence that the Hamal was carrying a large volume of drugs, it could not be boarded in international waters by the UK authorities without the permission of the Tanzanian government - something they had never previously granted."
1357,苏格兰皇家检察署国际司法与有组织犯罪部门主管苏·帕滕表示：“检察署派驻坦桑尼亚的刑事司法顾问采取了快速而精确的行动，获得坦桑尼亚有关部门的批准，得以在收到情报后的24小时内登船检查。”,"Sue Patten, head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) International Justice and Organised Crime Division, said: 'Acting quickly and precisely, the CPS criminal justice adviser in Tanzania was able get permission from the Tanzanian authorities to board the boat within 24 hours of receiving the intelligence."
1358,根据国际海事法，英国不能在国际水域对挂有外国国旗的船只进行登船检查，除非获得该国允许采取行动的特定法律许可。,"Under international maritime law, the UK cannot board a vessel in international waters which is under the flag of a foreign state unless that state gives specific legal permission to do so."
1359,若不是因为我们的刑事司法顾问行动迅速，该船很可能逃遁，我们也就无法将这些人绳之以法。,"Without the swift actions of our criminal justice adviser, there was a high risk that the vessel may have escaped and we would never have been able to bring these men to justice."
1360,摄影师布瑞恩·劳梅恩眼中腐朽的“东方快车”,Photographer Brian Romeijn captures the decaying 'Orient Express' train
1361,这些是现居鹿特丹的摄影师布瑞恩·劳梅恩在比利时拍摄的一列被遗弃的火车的照片,Rotterdam-based photographer Brian Romeijn snapped these photos of an abandoned train in Belgium
1362,照片显示该列车锈迹斑斑的外表、破败的座椅、尘封的窗户以及狭小的机师室,"Images show the train's rusting exterior, torn seats, dust-covered windows and compact engineer's room"
1363,这就是被誉为东方快车的车厢，不过它属于比利时的国家运营商。,"It has gained a reputation as an Orient Express carriage, but it belonged to Belgium's national operator"
1364,一名城市探险家拍摄到这些引人注目的照片，这是一列客车的腐烂残骸，而该列车曾经最好的旅行方式之一。,An urban explorer has captured these remarkable photos of the decaying remains of a passenger train that was once one of the finest ways to travel.
1365,它们的辉煌日子早已一去不返，只留下列车的车厢和机车在火车站场里任其腐烂，而这里却成为了受到摄影师和探险家青睐的景点。,"With their glory days long gone, the train carriage and locomotive have been left to rot at a train yard in Belgium, where they have become a popular attraction for photographers and adventurers."
1366,现居鹿特丹的40岁摄影师布瑞恩·劳梅恩拍摄到这些怪诞的照片，其中显示被遗弃火车的锈迹斑斑的外表、破败的座椅、尘封的窗户与地板以及狭小的机师室。,"Rotterdam-based photographer Brian Romeijn, 40, snapped these eerie images, which show the abandoned train's rusting exterior, torn seats, dust-covered windows and floors and compact engineer's room."
1367,列车车厢和机车被遗弃在比利时一处火车站场里任其腐朽，却吸引着城市探险家前往,"The train carriage and locomotive have been left to rot at a train yard in Belgium, attracting urban explorers"
1368,从1883年到2009年以其传奇名声而运营的期间，那些列车曾经是一种奢侈的象征。,Those trains were a symbol of luxury when they operated under that legendary name from 1883 to 2009.
1369,这种机车大约在50年前被比利时国家铁路公司所采用。,The locomotive was used by Belgium's national rail company around 50 years ago.
1370,在铁道上运行了126年之后，以东方快车命名的最后一趟列车服务于2009年12月从斯特拉斯堡驶向维也纳，自此终结了一端辉煌的历史。,"After 126 years on the rails, the last train service operating under the Orient Express name was from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009, bringing an end to a celebrated history."
1371,在巴黎和伊斯坦布尔之间运营的东方快车十分著名。,The Orient Express famously operated between Paris and Istanbul.
1372,在1883年，国际卧铺车公司开始运营该列车线路时，它被称为“东方的快车”。,When it started in 1883 - run by La Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits - it was known as the Express d'Orient.
1373,在1891年，它被称为“东方快车”，到了20世纪30年代，开始了覆盖全欧洲的定期运营服务。,It became the Orient Express in 1891 and by the 1930s operated scheduled services throughout Europe.
1374,不要将它与私人运营的威尼斯辛普伦东方快车相混淆。,It's not to be confused with the privately run Venice Simplon-Orient-Express.
1375,现仍存世的国际卧铺车公司豪华车厢数量极其稀少。,Very few Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits luxury carriages still exist.
1376,这张照片显示，狭小的机师室里面的设备正在锈蚀，仪表未被拆除，电线裸露在外,"This snap shows the compact engineer's room, where equipment is rusting, gauges are still installed and wires are exposed"
1377,劳梅恩说，这个机师室显得“有点幽闭，而且机车的噪音肯定非常大”,Romeijn said the engineer's room was 'kind of claustrophobic and the noise of the engine must have been tremendous'
1378,这些被遗弃的机车与车厢已经成为深受摄影师和探险家青睐的景点,The abandoned locomotive and carriage have become a popular attraction for photographers and adventurers
1379,在比利时造访了这些被遗忘的火车之后，劳梅恩对每日邮报网旅游频道说：“我真的能感受到这个列车在全盛期时的使用光景。”,"After visiting the forgotten train in Belgium, Romeijn told MailOnline Travel: 'I really could feel how it must have been used in its heyday."
1380,旅途上，戴着高帽的富有绅士和衣着美丽的女士相伴相随。,Wealthy gentlemen with high hats are joined by ladies in beautiful dresses on their journey.
1381,化妆师凯特琳·加洛韦变身《发展受阻》中的巴斯特·布拉斯,Make-up artist Katelyn Galloway transforms into Arrested Development's Buster Bluth
1382,得克萨斯人凯特琳·加洛韦以她那令人印象深刻的化妆技巧、评论和变身形象吸引了众多YouTube粉丝。,"Her impressive make-up skills, reviews and transformations have earned the Texan YouTuber Katelyn Galloway an army of fans."
1383,不过，她最新的角色转换，变身为《发展受阻》中的巴斯特·布拉斯，从任何人的标准看来都相当不可思议。,"But her latest transformation, into Buster Bluth from Arrested Development, is pretty incredible by anyone's standards."
1384,在上传至她的“Kiki G”YouTube频道的一段三分钟视频里，加洛韦女士慢慢且有条不紊地使自己转变成为那个钩子手倒霉蛋角色。,"In a three minute video uploaded to her Kiki G YouTube channel, Ms Galloway slowly and steadily transforms herself into the hapless, hook-handed character."
1385,在视频剪辑的末尾，她甚至使用了出自剧中的一些音乐，营造出一种辉煌却又怪诞的氛围。,"She even uses some audio from the show at the end of the clip, in an eerie albeit brilliant tribute."
1386,在视频的开始，这位天才化妆师展现的是其常规的金发、女性的自我。,"The talented make-up artist begins her video as her regular blonde, female self."
1387,然后，通过巧妙运用延时摄影，她慢慢地变身成为秃顶且戴眼镜的“妈妈的好孩子”，就是托尼·海尔饰演的巴斯特·布拉斯。,"Then, via clever use of time-lapse photography, she slowly morphs into the balding, bespectacled 'motherboy' that is Tony Hale's Buster Bluth."
1388,加洛韦女士通过诸如彩色隐形眼镜、鼻子和眼睛周围造影修型，以及在头上绘制巴斯特的脸等手段实现了这种变身。,"Ms Galloway does this by the likes of coloured contact lenses, shading and contouring around the nose and eyes, as well as painting Buster's face onto her head."
1389,巧妙的方法：她通过巧妙运用延时摄影技术缓慢变身为托尼·海尔饰演的巴斯特·布拉斯,"Clever ways: Via clever use of time-lapse photography, she slowly morphs into Tony Hale's Buster Bluth"
1390,在拍摄视频的过程中，她还模仿那个备受追捧的电视角色的性格与习惯，惟妙惟肖地紧缩着下巴。,"She also takes on the personality and mannerisms of the cult TV character over the course of the video, tucking in her chin appropriately."
1391,在YouTube上分享的这段视频已经被观看了超过45000次，网友纷纷赞美这位化妆师的技巧：,"The clip, shared on YouTube, has been viewed more than 45,000 times, and commenters have been quick to laud the make-up artist's skills:"
1392,“你极有天赋，”一名网友在加洛韦女士张贴的内容下写道。,"'You are extremely talented,' one person wrote underneath Ms Galloway's post."
1393,在拍摄视频的过程中，她还模仿那个狂热电视角色的性格与习惯,"She also takes on the personality and mannerisms of the cult TV character over the course of the video, too"
1394,“在做这些事的同时你还能进入角色，我非常喜欢这种方式，”另一位网友补充道。,"'I love how you stay in character while you're doing these,' someone else added."
1395,博主凯特琳·加洛韦此前变身为《公园与游憩》中的角色罗恩·斯旺森，也实现了病毒式营销的成功。,"Vlogger Katelyn Galloway had previous viral success with her transformation into Parks and Recreation character, Ron Swanson."
1396,她对YouTube上的追随者说，她希望近期每周都能塑造化妆变身形象。,She has told her YouTube followers that she hopes to create weekly make-up transformations in the near future.

1398,兰开夏郡父亲因身着带脏话的T恤被禁止进入子女的学校,Lancashire father banned from children's school after wearing T-shirt with swear word
1399,一位膝下有两个孩子的父亲因身着带冒犯字眼的汗衫出现在孩子的运动日里而被禁止进入其孩子所在的学校。,A father-of-two has been banned from his children's school for turning up at their sports day in an offensive T-shirt.
1400,克雷格·麦克白现年36岁，居住在兰开夏郡伯恩利市，他说自己“不小心”才穿上了那件带有标语“Let's get out there and t**t it”的上衣。,"Craig McBeth, 36, from Burnley, in Lancashire, says he 'accidentally' wore the top with the slogan ""Let's get out there and t**t it'."
1401,然而，尽管他意识到犯了错，随后把T恤反穿并作出道歉，次日他却发现自己被禁止进入学校场地。,"But despite apologising when he realised his error and turning the T-shirt inside out, the next day he discovered he was barred from the school grounds."
1402,这位单身父亲曾在伯恩利市科恩的公园小学担任过四年学校董事，由于此项禁令他无法接他的孩子，学校工作人员甚至给社会服务机构和警察打了电话。,"The single father, who had been a governor for four years at Park Primary School, in Colne, Burnley, was unable to pick up his kids because of the ban and the staff even called social services and the police."
1403,现年36岁家住伯恩利市的克雷格·麦克白表示，自从身着这件冒犯性的T恤出现在他孩子的运动日之后，他就被禁止进入学校场地。,"Craig McBeth, 36, from Burnley says he was barred from the school grounds after wearing this offensive T-shirt to his children's sports day"
1404,麦克白先生指责校长莎拉·米奇利反应过度。,Mr Burnley has accused head teacher Sarah Midgely of overreacting.
1405,他说自己因为急着观看两个孩子的比赛匆忙中误穿了那件T恤而受到了不公正的惩罚。,He said he is being unfairly punished for mistakenly putting on the T-shirt in a rush before going to watch his two children compete.
1406,这位父亲现已辞去学校董事的职位，他说：“那是一个错误，是我自己疏忽。”,"The dad, who has now quit as a school governor, said: ""It was a mistake, and an oversight on my part."
1407,当我穿上那件衣服时并没有想到是个运动日。,I was not thinking about sports day and rushing when I put it on.
1408,在那天的运动会将近结束时，我们举行了父亲赛跑活动，校长注意到了我的T恤并说它不太合适。,Towards the end of the event we were having a father's race and the head teacher noticed my T-shirt and said it was not appropriate.
1409,我作了道歉，把那件衣服反过来穿，心想这件事就算结束了。,I apologised and turned it inside out and thought that was the end of the matter.
1410,不过，这位36岁的父亲表示后来在那天傍晚时他收到了学校董事长发来的一封电子邮件，请他次日去与校长面谈，但是他当时认为没有那个必要，因为自己已经道歉过了。,"But the 36-year-old said he received an email from the chairman of governors later that evening asking him to meet with the head the next day, but he did not see the need after he had already apologised."
1411,麦克白先生补充道：“校长然后给我打了电话，说我被禁止进入学校的场所。”,"""The headteacher then phoned me and said I was barred from the school premises,"" added Mr Burnley,"
1412,我发现那个运动日之后，一些家长上了脸谱网对此事作了一些大惊小怪的评论，于是引起许多人关注。,I found out after the sports day some of the parents went on Facebook and made a fuss about it and that got a lot of people interested.
1413,只要是有理智的人都会认为这是一种过度反应。,Any right-minded person would think this was an overreaction.
1414,身为网络杂志《Love Mini》编辑的麦克白先生表示，他相信由于这个禁令自己甚至无法在学期的最后一天去接自己的孩子。,"Mr McBeth, who is the editor of an online magazine called Love Mini, said he believed he could not even pick his children up on the last day of term, because of the ban."
1415,不过，这却促使学校和社会服务机构打来电话。,But this prompted a phone call from the school and social services.
1416,那件肇事的T恤带有一幅克雷格·查尔斯饰演的角色李斯特的图片，该角色出自备受追捧的英国广播公司喜剧片《红矮星号》，其中带有一句该角色的标志性话语“Let's go out and t**t it”。,The t-shirt had a picture of Craig Charles's character Lister from the cult BBC comedy Red Dwarf with one of his iconic lines -'Let's go out and t**t it.'
1417,他评论道：“我告诉他们我去不了，因为他们禁止我进入学校。”,"He commented: ""I told them I was not there because they had banned me from the school."
1418,然后，我接到社会服务机构打来的电话，问我为何没有去接我的女儿。,I then got a phone call from social services asking why I had not picked my daughter up.
1419,学校还给警察打了电话，因为将近40分钟过去了我还没有去接女儿。,The school also called the police because I did not pick up my daughter for about 40 minutes.
1420,麦克白先生声称他被告知自己不再被允许进入学校场所并且在接到进一步通知之前该禁令始终有效。,Mr McBeth claims he was told he is no longer permitted to come on to the school premises and the prohibition will continue until further notice.
1421,他说他还被警告如果被发现非法侵入则可能面对500英镑的罚款。,He says he was also warned he could face a fine of £500 if found trespassing.
1422,公园小学校长莎拉·米奇利表示这件事现已结束,"Sarah Midgley, headteacher at Park Primary School, said this matter is now closed"
1423,公园小学校长莎拉·米奇利表示：“我可以确认麦克白先生已经辞职并且不再是本校的董事。”,"Sarah Midgley, headteacher at Park Primary School, said: ""I can confirm that Mr McBeth has resigned and is no longer a governor at our school."
1424,这件事现已结束，我期待着在九月重返正常的校园生活。,This matter is now closed and I'm looking forward to getting back to normal school life in September.
1425,伯恩利市议员乔·库尼表示该学校有明确的政策与指导方针。,Burnley councillor Joe Cooney said the school had clear policies and guidelines.
1426,他说：“我们都必须牢记，当你担负诸如议员或学校董事之类的角色时，也就意味着你必须以更高的标准自律。遗憾的是，他这次没能满足那种标准。”,"""We all have to bear in mind when you take on these roles such as a councillor or governor you are held to a higher standard and unfortunately this time he has not met that standard,"" he said."
1427,议员乔纳森·尼克松补充说，他没想到学校竟会禁止他进入，事态被夸大了。,Councillor Jonathan Nixon added he did not think the school should have banned him and the situation had been blown out of proportion.
1428,尼克松补充道：“他穿着那件T恤是很愚蠢，当时他道过歉了。”,"Mr Nixon added: ""He was stupid to wear the T-shirt and he apologised at the time."""
1429,兰开夏郡警方确认他们接到了学校的电话但没有出席。,"Lancashire Police confirmed they were called by the school, but did not attend."
1430,65%的委内瑞拉人想罢黜马杜罗，问题是他们是否愿意为之斗争,"65% of Venezuelans want to oust Maduro, the question is if they are willing to fight for it"
1431,有三分之二的委内瑞拉人希望罢免总统尼古拉斯·马杜罗，但问题似乎在于他们是否愿意为之斗争。,"Two out of three Venezuelans want to revoke President Nicolas Maduro, but the question seems to be whether or not they are willing to fight for it."
1432,在国家选举委员会宣布今年“没有时间”举行罢免投票（从而保证查韦斯主义掌控权力直至2019年）的次日，加拉加斯的人们一切照旧，似乎什么事情也没有发生过。,"The day after the National Electoral Board announced that there is ""no time"" for the recall vote to take place this year - securing Chavismo's grip of power until 2019 - people in Caracas went about their day as if nothing had happened."
1433,周三在阿尔塔米拉广场休息的36岁办公室职员拉斐尔·德扬表示：“我没有听说那条新闻，因为我当时在观看奥运会，看迈克尔·菲尔普斯如何再将两枚奖牌收入囊中。”,"""I didn't hear the news because I was watching the Olympics and how Michael Phelps won two more medals,"" said Rafael Deyan, a 36-year-old office clerk taking a break in Altamira Square on Wednesday."
1434,位于加拉加斯市东区的阿尔塔米拉广场在2014年初时曾是为抗议马杜罗政权而发生的激烈暴乱的集中点。,"Altamira Square, located in the east of Caracas, was the epicenter in early 2014 of fierce riots protesting against Maduro's regime."
1435,然而现在，当需要反对派施加比以往更多压力以在今年促成公民投票之时，并非全国人民都表现出同样的热情。,"Yet now, when the opposition needs to apply more pressure than ever to make the referendum happens this year, people across the country are not showing the same energy."
1436,德扬表示：“我希望进行公民投票，但是为了安全起见我不会进行抗议。”,"""I want a referendum, but I won't protest for security reasons,"" said Deyan."
1437,其他人更为明智的人愿意在未来动员起来，但承认委内瑞拉人动力不足。,"Others, more informed, are willing to mobilize in the future but admit Venezuelans are less motivated."
1438,选举委员会主席提比塞·卢塞纳的评论证明政府正在阻碍罢免进程。,Electoral board president Tibisay Lucena's comments prove that the government is hindering the recall process.
1439,现年60岁的罗伯托雷耶斯告诉福克斯拉丁新闻说：“只要反对派呼吁进行抗议我就会参加抗议，但是我知道我的一些朋友感到害怕。”,"I will protest whenever the opposition calls for a protest, but I know that some of my friends are scared,"" Roberto Reyes, 60, told Fox News Latino."
1440,所以，除了政府为延迟公民投票而提出的许多阻碍之外，反对派现在还面临另一个挑战：动员人民走上街头进行抗议。,"So on top to the many barriers the government has raised to delay the referendum, the opposition now faces another challenge: motivating people to go out to the streets and protest."
1441,直至最近，公民投票的倡议还得到大量支持，在收集签名的阶段，动员起来的人数达到了前所未有的规模。,Until recently the referendum initiative had plenty of support - people moved in unprecedented numbers during the collection of signatures phase.
1442,但是，在抗议政府为阻碍这一努力所进行的演习时，集会人群表面上看起来却很少。,"But when it comes to protesting against the government's maneuvers to block the effort, turnout at rallies have been ostensibly low."
1443,反对派议员西普里亚诺·埃雷迪亚表示：“一些人专注于制作食物，而其他人则因2014年发生的多起逮捕和死亡事件而感到害怕。”,"""Some people are focused in making food lines, while others are scared after the many arrests and deaths in 2014,"" said Cipriano Heredia, a lawmaker for the opposition."
1444,在卢塞纳宣布公民投票进程的下一个步骤（即在全国范围收集更多签名）将不得不等到十月才能进行之后，反对该国社会主义政府的人们宣称总统马杜罗及其追随者正试图消磨委内瑞拉人的意志，使他们相信今年举行一次投票几乎是不可能的。,"After Lucena announced that the next step in the referendum process - gather yet more signatures countrywide - would have to wait until October, those opposed to the socialist government claim President Maduro and his acolytes are just trying to discourage Venezuelans, making them believe that a vote this year is all but impossible."
1445,根据宪法，如果公民投票在2017年举行，马杜罗可能被迫离职，但他会被允许指定一名继任者。,"According to the Constitution, if the referendum were to be held in 2017, Maduro could be forced out of office but he would be allowed to name a successor."
1446,不过，如果他在今年被罢黜，则他就必须要求举行大选。,"If he were ousted this year, however, he is mandated to call for a general election."
1447,美国国务院在周四下午的一份声明中提及了该问题，呼吁委内瑞拉当局确保委内瑞拉人民行使宪法赋予的权利。,"The U.S. Department of State addressed the issue in a statement Thursday afternoon, calling on the Venezuelan authorities to guarantee the exercise of the constitutional rights of the Venezuelan people."
1448,该声明说：“实现总统罢免公民投票的剩余步骤需要明确、具体、毫不拖延地执行，从而有助于快速有效地解决当前委内瑞拉国内的政治、经济和社会问题。”,"""The remaining steps for the realization of the Presidential Recall Referendum need to be pursued clearly, concretely and without delay, and thus contribute to the quick and effective resolution of the current political, economic and social difficulties in the country,"" it read."
1449,曾在2006到2009年任选举委员会成员的政治分析家路易斯·萨拉曼卡表示，改变不可能很快发生。,"Luis Salamanca, a political analyst who was a member of the Electoral Board between 2006 and 2009, said change is not likely anytime soon."
1450,他告诉福克斯拉丁新闻说：“我认为今年不会有公民投票，除非出现规模大得多的社会动荡和抗议。”,"""I think that there will not be a referendum this year, unless the social unrest and protests grow much more,"" he told FNL."
1451,在他看来，卢塞纳和政府正在破坏法律，但只要人民不作出足够强烈的抗议，他们则可能最终达到其目的。,"He said that in his view Lucena and the government are breaking the law, but they may ultimately achieve their goal if people don't protest loud enough."
1452,反对派已呼吁9月1日在加拉加斯举行一次大集会，要求加快进程从而可以在今年进行罢免投票。,The opposition has called for a big rally on Sept. 1st in Caracas to demand a speed-up of the process so the recall can take place this year.
1453,在那一天，我们希望全国各地的人们前来首都城市进行动员。,We want people from all over the country to mobilize to the capital city on that day.
1454,“政府将感受到压力，”埃雷迪亚说。,"The government will feel the pressure,"" Heredia said."
1455,但萨拉曼卡认为形势已不容等待那么长时间。,But Salamanca thinks that the situation can't wait that long.
1456,该专家告诉福克斯拉丁新闻说：“他们应该对卢塞纳的宣告作出更快速、更强烈的响应，因为该宣告实际上消灭了公民投票。”,"""They should have a quicker and stronger response to Lucena's announcement because it practically kills the referendum,"" the expert told FNL."
1457,国会议员埃雷迪亚承认反对派内部的有些党派正急于尽快促成集会，但其他集团则希望有更多时间来组织。,"Congressman Heredia admitted that some parties inside the opposition are pushing to make the rally sooner, but other groups prefer to have more time to organize."
1458,现在反对派必须小心了。,The opposition has to be careful now.
1459,萨拉曼卡表示：“如果人们迫于形势而气馁，则第二轮签名请愿的参与人数有降低的风险。”,"If people get discouraged by the situation there is a risk of low turnout in the second round of signature petition,"" said Salamanca."
1460,公民投票进程必须得到国内20%的选民也就是将近400万人的支持才能被有效激活。,"The referendum process has to count with the support of 20 percent of the country's electorate, close to 4 million people, in order to be activated."
1461,萨拉曼卡和其他分析家相信，即使罢免发生在2017年，查韦斯主义也将受挫。,"Salamanca and other analysts are confident that even if the recall takes place on 2017, Chavismo will be hurt."
1462,不过，有些人则没那么乐观。,But some are not that optimistic.
1463,我们的党派希望今年出现政治变革。,Our party wants political change this year.
1464,埃雷迪亚告诉福克斯拉丁新闻说：“如果政府关闭这条选举途径，我们将不得不探索其他的合法选择。”,"""If the government closes down the electoral path, we will have to explore other legal options,"" Heredia told FNL."
1465,英超联赛2016-17赛季预评之19：西布罗姆维奇队,Premier League 2016-17 previews No19 West Bromwich Albion
1466,卫报新闻记者预测排位第14位（注意：这并不一定是阿兰·史密斯的预测，而是本报大多数新闻记者的观点）,"Guardian writers"" predicted position 14th (NB: this is not necessarily Alan Smith's prediction but the average of our writers"" tips)"
1467,上个赛季排名第14位,Last season's position 14th
1468,"赢得联赛冠军的赔率（通过Oddschecker统计）为1,000-1","Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker) 1,000-1"
1469,新赛季、老样子，直到上周，西布罗姆维奇队看起来还是如此：在作风一向务实的托尼·普利斯的率领下，2016-17赛季可能又是一个舒服或者停滞不前的赛季，这取决于谦虚谨慎程度。,"Until last week it looked like a case of new season, same old West Bromwich Albion: 2016-17 would be another campaign of comfort - or stagnation depending on how empty the glass is - under the ever-pragmatic Tony Pulis."
1470,不过，随着杰里米·皮斯将其持有的该俱乐部88%的股权出售给了赖国传和被誉为安全之手的普利斯，在主帅常被炒鱿鱼这样向来令人不快的市场上，这支球队立即成为了博彩公司的最爱。,"But then Jeremy Peace sold his 88% stake in the club to Guochuan Lai and Pulis, the archetypal safe pair of hands, was immediately made the bookmakers"" favourite in the ever unpleasant market of first manager to be fired."
1471,黑乡的态势发生了确定无疑的改变，这种改变不仅发生在山楂球场，而且发生在伍尔弗汉普顿西北方数英里的地方，在那里，来自中国的新东家毫不犹豫地解除了肯尼·杰基特的职务。,"The landscape has undeniably altered in the Black Country - and not just at The Hawthorns, but a few miles north-west in Wolverhampton, too, where new Chinese owners wasted no time in relieving Kenny Jackett of his services."
1472,不过，普利斯的工作不会马上受到威胁。赖先生打消了普利斯的顾虑，这位企业家还声明他想保持该俱乐部的文化。,"Pulis, however, has been given reassurances by Lai that his job is not in immediate threat, and the entrepreneur has also stated his desire not to alter the club culture."
1473,在接管俱乐部时，赖先生表示：“我不想改变这个俱乐部的气质，也不想进行不可持续的挥霍。”,"""I have no wish to change the club's ethos or embark on an unsustainable spending spree,"" he said upon taking over."
1474,我想做一个好东家，对这家俱乐部进行长期投资。,I want to be a good owner and to invest in this club for the long term.
1475,首先，我们的目标是确保我们保持在英超联赛的行列之中，然后在这个基础上，我希望俱乐部的排名处于靠前的半数球队中。,"First and foremost, our goal is to ensure that we remain in the Premier League and then beyond that, I would like to see the club establish itself in the top half of the division."
1476,我相信这是世界上最好的足球联赛，我希望尽可能带领这支俱乐部走得更远。,I believe it is the best league in the world and I want to take this club as far as possible.
1477,根据普利斯的记录，第一个方面应该不成问题。,"Such is Pulis's record, the first aspect should not be too problematic."
1478,下一个目标是打进排名榜的前半部，不过对于新东家和冀望快速提升排名的日益分化的球迷们而言，重要的是需要意识到这也是一项越来越繁重的任务，因为名列中游的其他球队最近也在赶超。,"The next aim is to break into the top half of the table, but it will be important for the new owner and an increasingly divided fanbase hoping for a quick shoot up the table to realise that is an increasingly onerous task because of the recent ground made up by other mid-table sides."
1479,在上个赛季排名第14位的最终成绩基础上超越半数球队，肯定比渐渐提升排名得付出更多心血。,To progress from last season's 14th-place finish will certainly require more of an edge up front.
1480,只有阿斯顿维拉这支垫底球队的进球数比他们更少，而且值得一提的是，在圣诞节期间，西布罗姆维奇队平均每90分钟射门次数少于一次，一度是赛区表现最差球队。,"Only Aston Villa, tailed off at the bottom, scored fewer goals and it is worth recalling that at Christmas Albion were averaging fewer than a shot on target per 90 minutes, by some stretch the division's worst."
1481,在38场比赛中，他们有13场没有得分，仅在9场比赛中进球超过一粒。,They failed to score in 13 of their 38 games and found the net more than once on only nine occasions.
1482,在获胜的10场比赛中，他们没有一次领先超过1球，有七次以1-0取胜。,"Of their 10 victories, not one was by more than single goal and seven finished 1-0."
1483,不出所料的是，在他们总共34粒稀松的进球中，有十几粒进球出自定位球。,"Predictably, a dozen of their sparse total of 34 came from set pieces."
1484,难怪山楂球场经常出现不满情绪反应，大概最令人注目的就是一月末与阿斯顿维拉队以0-0战平的糟糕表现，那场比赛中客队看起来更加糟糕。,"Little wonder disgruntled reactions were common at The Hawthorns, perhaps most notably after a diabolical 0-0 draw with Villa in late January, when the visitors looked the more likely."
1485,另一方面，只有前六支球队的防守记录较好，不过其他俱乐部都不可能主张经常保持四名中后卫。,"On the flip side, only the top six had better defensive records - though no other club could claim to regularly line up with four centre-halves."
1486,后卫往往被低估，特别是乔尼·埃文斯，据称阿森纳俱乐部在最近的伤员危机之后想邀请他加盟。,"Those defenders are often underappreciated, not least Jonny Evans, who is said to have Arsenal chasing him following their latest injury crisis."
1487,这位北爱尔兰国脚在欧洲锦标赛中表现良好，没有巨额转会电话，费西布罗姆维奇俱乐部不会放人。,The Northern Ireland international enjoyed a fine European Championship and it would take a hefty fee for Albion to sell.
1488,本·福斯特的进球表现可靠，他们在中场的位置很好。,Ben Foster is dependable in goal and they are well stocked in midfield.
1489,与埃文斯十分相似，达伦·弗莱彻也有大量证据表明他在32岁时仍能发挥较高的竞技水平，而克劳迪奥·雅科布则被低估了。,"Darren Fletcher, much like Evans, displayed plenty of evidence that he would still be capable of performing at a higher level at 32, and Claudio Yacob is underrated."
1490,令各方烦心的是，赛多·贝拉希诺的未来去向这一漫长而曲折的故事仍没有完结。,Irritatingly for all parties the long and winding tale of Saido Berahino's future remains unresolved.
1491,在皮斯主持该俱乐部时，斯托克城和水晶宫对马克·休斯的报价均被拒绝，不过斯托克城仍保持热情，而马克·休斯则乐于耐心等待。,Bids from Stoke and Crystal Palace were rejected under Peace's ownership but the former remain keen and Mark Hughes is happy to be patient.
1492,在上个赛季接近尾声之后，所有相关方理所当然应采取行动了。,"After last season was close to a write-off, it makes sense for all concerned for a move to go through."
1493,这位前锋无疑很有天赋，正如普利斯多次提及的那样，大家争相拉拢他，不过有一点早已明确，那就是仅靠关系并不能得到他。,"The striker is undoubtedly talented but with, as Pulis mentioned more than once, people dragging him one way and pulling him the other it has long been evident the relationship is unworkable."
1494,"西布罗姆维奇俱乐部坚持要签下一个替代球员才肯放走这位不足21岁的前英格兰国脚，不过他们以1,500万英镑邀请迪亚夫拉·萨科加盟的计划却在此次移交之前数天抛锚了，该俱乐部称他已经通过了医疗检查而且一切都符合要求，但是他背部受了伤，这意味着他会错过赛季的开始阶段。","Albion are insistent upon signing a replacement before letting the former England Under-21 international go but their £15m move for Diafra Sakho broke down days before the takeover, with the club stating he had passed his medical and everything was agreed but he had a back injury that would have meant missing the start of the season."
1495,这为委内瑞拉球员所罗门·隆顿带来许多压力，他上个赛季有一些亮丽的表现但需要在9粒进球的基础上进一步提高，尤其是在瑞奇·兰伯特持续状态不佳的情况下。,"It places a lot of pressure on the Venezuelan Salomón Rondón, who showed brief flashes of promise last season but needs to improve on his return of nine goals, especially if Rickie Lambert continues to be as ineffective."
1496,回想起来，放走维克托·阿尼切贝和斯特凡·塞塞尼翁的决定也有些不可思议。,The decision to release Victor Anichebe and Stéphane Sessègnon also looks odd in retrospect.
1497,普利斯在职业生涯中起用年轻球员的效率之慢可谓臭名昭著，在上个赛季以1-1战平利物浦队的最后一场比赛中进入其视野的三名青少年球员（乔纳森·莱科、山姆·菲尔德和泰勒·罗伯茨）不太可能成为常态。,"Pulis has been notoriously slow to promote young players throughout his career and the sight of three teenagers - Jonathan Leko, Sam Field and Tyler Roberts - in the final game of last season, a 1-1 draw with Liverpool, is unlikely to become the norm."
1498,他将回头寻找那些经过试用和测试的球员，不过莱科的确值得关注。,He will return to the tried and tested but Leko is worth keeping an eye on.
1499,这位17岁的攻击型前卫在上个赛季总共出场五次，他是英超联赛中出现的首个1999年出生的球员，在英国青少年球队中也受到高度评价。,"The 17-year-old attacking midfielder made five appearances in total last season, becoming the first player born in 1999 to appear in the Premier League, and is also highly rated in the England underage system."
1500,以550万英镑转会费从女王公园巡游者足球俱乐部签来的马特·菲利普斯将带来速度，他是进入周末联赛开幕赛事的唯一新球员。,"Matt Phillips, a £5.5m signing from Queens Park Rangers, will provide pace but he is the sole new player entering the opening weekend of the campaign."
1501,有理由相信，这可能会是一个非常繁忙的转会窗口结束期。,It is not wild to suggest the end of the window could be a hectic one.
1502,在谈到什么地方需要加强时，普利斯告诉《明星快报》说：“到处都需要。”,"""All over,"" Pulis told the Express and Star last month about where needs to be strengthened."
1503,你所看见的每一个位置。,Every position that you look at.
1504,后场球员、中场球员和前场球员，我们都必须加强。,"The back players, midfield players and front players, we have to strengthen."
1505,目标已经确定，我们知道自己想要什么。,"The targets have been there, we know what we want."
1506,事实表明获得他们要比想象中的情况更难，主要是由于移交过程中存在不确定性。,"Getting them is proving more difficult than envisaged, mostly due to uncertainty during the takeover process."
1507,这个赛季的形势可以通过他们的开赛表现进行判断，从十月中旬开始他们要奔波于曼彻斯特市、利物浦市、托特纳姆市和莱斯特市进行七场志在必得的比赛。,"The season could be defined by how they start, with seven eminently winnable games before a daunting run of Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from mid-October."
1508,到那时，普利斯身上的压力要么会得到释放，要么会变得更加艰巨。,By that point the pressure on Pulis will have eased or become insurmountable.
1509,而且，即使是贝拉希诺大概也会找到一家新的俱乐部，谁知道呢！,"And, who knows, maybe even Berahino will have found a new club."
1510,受托人支持养老金改革，塔塔钢铁英国公司援助协议行将达成,Tata Steel UK rescue deal closer after trustees back pension changes
1511,塔塔钢铁英国公司幕后的养老金受托人表示，方案可能重组且不会进入养老金保护基金(PPF)，从而使该公司达成援助协议的可能性大增。,"The pension trustees behind Tata Steel UK have said the scheme can be restructured without entering the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), boosting the prospects of a rescue deal for the company."
1512,英国钢铁业养老金计划负债150亿英镑，按照某些指标衡量财政赤字高达7亿英镑，成为塔塔钢铁英国公司和威尔士的塔尔伯特港钢铁厂达成援助协议的一项严重障碍。,"The British Steel Pension Scheme has liabilities of £15bn and a deficit of as much as £700m by some measures, making it a serious obstacle for a rescue deal for Tata Steel UK and the Port Talbot steelworks in Wales."
1513,"在与商务大臣和养老金监管机构进行数次会谈之后，塔塔钢铁对于确保其英国业务的未来日益自信。塔塔钢铁英国公司拥有11,000名员工。","Tata Steel is increasingly confident about securing the future of its UK business, which employs 11,000 people, after talks with the business secretary and the Pensions Regulator."
1514,该公司计划将其包括英国公司在内的欧洲业务与德国企业集团蒂森克虏伯合并。,"The company plans to merge its European operations, including the UK business, with those of ThyssenKrupp, the German conglomerate."
1515,不过，援助协议的条件是英国钢铁业养老金计划需要重组并且政府需要提供金融支持。,"However, the deal is conditional on the British Steel Pension Scheme being restructured and the government providing financial support."
1516,养老金受托人主席阿兰·约翰斯顿表示，如果对工人利益进行修订则该方案可以避免陷入养老金保护基金。,"Allan Johnston, chair of the pension trustees, said the scheme could avoid falling into the PPF if the benefits for workers were modified."
1517,虽然与其他方案相比，该方案资金充足，在某些指标上缩减赤字至3亿英镑，塔塔钢铁和蒂森克虏伯集团热衷于使债务得到控制。,"Although it is well-funded compared with other schemes, with the deficit narrowing to £300m on some measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp are keen to keep its liabilities under control."
1518,约翰斯顿表示，受托人承认让该合资企业或者塔塔钢铁英国公司的任何买家来为当前和未来的赤字承担费用都“不太现实”。,"Johnston said the trustees accepted it ""would not be realistic"" for the joint venture or any buyer of Tata Steel UK to take on responsibility for funding the current and future deficit."
1519,他补充道，与纳入养老金保护基金相比，修改计划中的福利安排是一种更具吸引力的选择，因为养老金保护基金会降低工人的待遇。,"Modifying the benefits of the scheme was a more attractive option than it entering the PPF, he added, where workers would have to accept reduced terms."
1520,塔塔钢铁的消息来源警告称，该公司仍可能卖掉塔尔伯特港工厂。,Tata Steel sources have warned it could still sell Port Talbot.
1521,自三月关于其英国公司未来安排的谈判开始以来，该公司一直拒绝为那些钢铁厂的未来提供担保，这被用作与英国政府讨价还价的筹码。,"The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of the steelworks since talks began about the future of its UK business in March, and this has been used as a bargaining chip in talks with the British government."
1522,塔塔钢铁欧洲公司执行总监库什科·查特吉表示，该印度企业集团希望将其钢铁业务打造得“更具可持续性”。,"Koushik Chatterjee, executive director of Tata Steel Europe, said the Indian conglomerate wants to make its steel business ""more sustainable."""
1523,查特吉在塔塔钢铁公司印度年会会场边发言称，关于重组养老金计划的谈判正在取得进展，但他坚称该计划资金充足。,"Speaking at the sidelines of Tata Steel's annual meeting in India, Chatterjee said talks to restructure the pension scheme were progressing, but he insisted the scheme is well-funded."
1524,据印度时报报道，查特吉表示：“我们正在与各个利益相关方讨论，其中包括英国政府和其他例如威尔士政府等等在内的利益相关方。”,"""We are discussing with various stakeholders, including the British government and other stakeholders like the government of Wales and so on,"" Chatterjee said, according to the Times of India."
1525,有一个共识是，养老金对像钢铁业这样的商品生意具有一定影响，因此我们不得不寻求一种不影响企业进一步发展的结构性解决方案。,"There is a recognition that pension has a certain impact in a commodity business like steel, so we have to find a structural solution, which does not impact the business going forward."
1526,养老金受托人同意在有关重组该方案的谈判中予以合作，这将受到塔塔钢铁的欢迎。,"The pension trustees"" willingness to cooperate in talks to restructure the scheme will be welcomed by Tata Steel."
1527,方案可能作出的改变包括如何通过零售价格指数直至较低的消费价格指数来衡量福利中与年度通胀相关的增长，以及把养老金支付额的未来增长限制在法律所要求的最低限度。,"The potential changes to the scheme include shifting how the annual inflation-based increase in benefits is measured from the retail price index to the lower consumer price index, as well as limiting future increases in pension payments to the minimum required by law."
1528,约翰斯顿补充说：“受托人及其顾问为塔塔钢铁、政府和养老金监管机构提供了有力证据表明该方案能够无限期地支付修改后的福利，并且在养老金保护基金之外实现低风险。”,"Johnston added: ""The trustee and its advisers have provided Tata Steel, the government and the Pensions Regulator with compelling evidence of the scheme's ability to pay modified benefits indefinitely and on a low-risk basis outside the Pension Protection Fund."
1529,我们的投资策略意味着这项方案的资金头寸没有像其他许多英国养老金方案那样受到最近国债收益率下降的影响，而且我们相信这项方案能够像拟定的那样，在自给自足的基础上提供修改后的福利。,"Our investment strategy has meant that the scheme's funding position has not been affected by recent falls in gilt yields in the same way as many other UK pension schemes, and we remain confident of the scheme's ability to provide modified benefits as proposed on a self-sufficient basis."
1530,芝加哥期货交易所玉米、小麦和大豆期价11日涨跌不一。,"Corn, wheat and soybean futures prices delivered mixed performance at Chicago Board of Trade on November 11."
1531,市场分析师认为，玉米期价因市场交易量减少而下跌，而海外增加进口美国大豆推动大豆期价上涨。,"Market analysts held that the corn futures price declined on decreasing trading volume, while foreign countries' increased imports of soybeans from the U.S. drove up the soybean futures price."
1532,克里米亚11日发生一起大巴坠落峡谷的交通事故，造成5人死亡、13人受伤。,"A traffic accident in which a coach fell into a gorge took place in Crimea on August 11, leading to 5 deaths and 13 injuries."
1533,据悉，失事车辆上的乘客包括6名儿童，其中1名儿童当场死亡。,"It is learned that there were a total of six children in the wrecked coach, and one of them was pronounced dead at the scene."
1534,伤者已被送往当地医院救治，其中3名儿童和4名成人伤势严重，未脱离生命危险。,"The injured have been sent to a local hospital for emergency treatment, with three children and four adults being seriously injured and remaining in a critical condition."
1535,初步调查显示，该出事地段坡陡弯急，视野受限，极易发生交通事故。,"Preliminary investigations showed that the accident location is very easy to have traffic accidents due to the steep slopes and sharp turns, which limit drivers' view of the road."
1536,在经过11天的休整后，重庆力帆队今晚将在中超第22轮客场中，对阵中超老牌劲旅北京国安。,"After an 11-day rest, Chongqing Lifan Team will fight against Beijing Guoan, a powerful force with a long history under the Chinese Football Association Super League (CSL), in CSL's 22nd away game tonight."
1537,力帆主教练张外龙说，在间歇期里他对国安队进行了仔细的研究，全队赛前准备也比较充分，对这场比赛非常有信心。,"Chongqing Lifan Team's head coach Zhang Wailong said he was very confident in this game as he had carefully studied Beijing Guoan Team during the break, and the whole team is well prepared before the game."
1538,8月9日，北京国安和广州恒大进行了一场恶战，10日才从广州返回，第二天便立刻投入到新的备战中，几乎没有时间进行休整。,"Beijing Guoan had a fierce battle with Guangzhou Evergrande on August 9 and began preparing for the new game on the second day after returning from Guangzhou on August 10, leaving no time for them to have a rest."
1539,9月13日至16日，“中国经济论坛-北威州携手中国2016”活动将在德国杜塞尔多夫市举行。,"The ""China Economic Forum - Nordrhein-Westfalen Joins Hands with China 2016"" event will be launched in Dusseldorf, Germany, from September 13 to 16."
1540,主办方在重庆地区独家授权重庆晨报组团，向川渝企业家抛出橄榄枝，组队前往德国经济中心北威州学习、交流、考察，寻找新的商机。,"The sponsor exclusively licensed Chongqing Morning Post in Chongqing to court entrepreneurs in Sichuan and Chongqing to study, exchange, inspect and look for new business opportunities in group in Nordrhein-Westfalen, the economic hub of Germany."
1541,在杜塞尔多夫的考察行程结束后，考察团成员还将前往亚琛、布鲁塞尔、科隆、法兰克福等地参观考察。,"After wrapping up their inspections in Dusseldorf, members of the delegation will also head for Aachen, Brussels, Cologne and Frankfurt to conduct study tours."
1542,论坛期间，重庆晨报还将在杜塞尔多夫市举办“重庆城市发展成果图片展”，展出重庆近年来经济建设的成果。,"During the forum, Chongqing Morning Post will also launch a ""Picture exhibition on the achievements of urban development in Chongqing"" to put on display the city's economic development achievements in recent years."
1543,近年来，北威州（北莱茵-威斯特法伦州）和中国的经贸往来发展迅速，贸易额达到了350亿欧元。,"The economic and trade contact between Nordrhein-Westfalen and China has developed rapidly in the past few years, with the trade value reaching EUR 35 billion."
1544,作为中资企业进入德国的首选地，在北威州投资的中国企业超过800家，当地政府希望重庆企业家能踏上这片投资热土，感受当地的投资环境。,"As the preferred destination for Chinese enterprises to enter Germany, Nordrhein-Westfalen has attracted more than 800 Chinese enterprises to invest there, and the local government expected Chongqing entrepreneurs to go to this popular region for investment to feel the local investment environment."
1545,该案由省高级人民法院院长李静担任审判长，省人民检察院检察长王晋出庭支持公诉。,"Li Jing, president of the province's Higher People's Court, served as the presiding judge of this case, Wang Jin, chief procurator of the Provincial People's Procuratorate, appeared in court to support the process of indictment."
1546,据了解，这是我省司法改革后，也是省“两院”建立以来，首次由省高级人民法院院长、省人民检察院检察长同时出庭依法履行职务。,It is learned that this is the first time for president of the Provincial Higher People's Court and chief procurator of the Provincial People's Procuratorate to appear in court at the same time to perform their duties in accordance with law since the provincial judicial reform and even the establishment of the provincial higher court and the procuratorate.
1547,开庭前，李静仔细审阅了卷宗材料，撰写了阅卷笔录，并指导合议庭拟定庭审提纲和方案。,"Before the trial, Li Jing carefully reviewed the file materials, wrote records of the file review and guided the collegiate panel to draw up the trial outline and scheme."
1548,王晋依法审查了原审案卷材料，讯问了黄鹏，听取了辩护人的意见，补充收集了相关证据材料，并制作了出庭预案。,"Wang Jin reviewed records of the original judgments in accordance with law, interrogated Huang Peng and listened to the views of the defenders. Wang Jin also made a supplementary collection of the related evidentiary materials and a trial plan."
1549,鉴于该案案情重大，依法需提交审判委员会讨论决定，案件将择期另行宣判。,"As the case is significant, it should be submitted to the judicial committee for discussion pursuant to law, and the verdict will be announced in a selected time."
1550,据悉，此次审理是我省进一步推进员额制、司法责任制和以审判为中心的诉讼制度改革，落实入额院长、检察长带头办案要求的重要举措。,"It is understood that trial of the case is an important measure for the province to further promote reform of the judge quota system, the judicial accountability system and the trial-centered litigation system, and implement requirements for court presidents and chief procurators to take the lead in presiding judges and case handling."
1551,悠悠球是很多人童年的记忆，然而，您见过小小的悠悠球在手里转出千百花样吗？,"Yo-Yo is the childhood memory of many people, but have you ever seen it show different patterns?"
1552,只见短短几分钟内，悠悠球在他手中来回穿梭，变幻出多种玩法，令人惊叹。,"In just a few minutes, he showed multiple ways to play Yo-Yo, which was so amazing."
1553,据悉，悠悠球不仅是一项运动，也是世界上花式最多、最难、最具观赏性的手上技巧运动之一。,It is learned that Yo-Yo is more than a sport but also one of the hardest and most entertaining hand acrobatic sports with the most patterns in the world.
1554,通过打转手中的小球，让小球维持旋转以及变换绳索的方式就可以在空中摆出摩天轮等各式新奇造型。,You can rotate the small ball by spinning it and change the rope tying method to show various novel patterns in the air including ferris wheel.
1555,随着悠悠球运动的发展，全国各地也开始陆续举办悠悠活动赛，而能够锻炼指法和脑力创造力的悠悠球运动，也开始成为青少年追捧的健身方式。,"With the development of Yo-Yo sports, activities and competitions in relation to Yo-Yo were launched across the country. This sport, which could help exercise fingering and mental creativity, has also become a fitness means favored by teenagers."
1556,迟到两分钟家长迁怒校车司机驾驶室内殴打司机被行政拘留,A parent was held in administrative detention for beating a school bus driver after his child missed the bus for being two minutes late
1557,学生迟到2分钟，校车不停，没想到家长一时冲动，因此辱骂校车司机及跟车老师，并将校车司机殴打致伤。,The parent of a student insulted the school bus driver and the teacher on the bus and beat the driver out of impulse after his child missed the school bus for being two minutes late.
1558,司机觉得受了委屈报警，鄂州警方依法将该涉嫌殴打他人的家长行政拘留。,The driver felt that he was wronged and called the police. The Ezhou police placed the parent with alleged beating behavior under administrative detention.
1559,肖师傅是湖北省鄂州市梁子湖区梧桐湖新区一家幼儿园的校车司机，8月7日8时许，肖师傅驾驶校车到新区某村接上学的小朋友。,"Mr. Xiao is a school bus driver of a kindergarten in Wutonghu New Area of Liangzihu District, Ezhou City, Hubei Province. At about 8:00am on August 7, Xiao drove the bus to pick up children in a village in the new area."
1560,“今天下这么大雨，我们晚来了两分钟，你就不能等一下吗，为什么直接把车开走了，你也太不负责了！”,"""The rain is so heavy today, and we're two minutes late. Can't you wait us for a moment? Why do you drive off? You're so irresponsible!"""
1561,随后宫某下车，刚好与张老师相遇，又与张老师发生争执，双方最终不欢而散。,"Mr. Gong met teacher Zhang after getting off the bus and came into conflicts with her again, leaving an unhappy end."
1562,司机肖师傅被打了之后手部流血，头部被雨伞划伤，且伴有头痛现象。,Mr. Xiao's hands bled and his head was scratched by an umbrella. He also showed symptom of headache.
1563,“我只是一名司机，一切按照规定的时间、路线行驶，落下小明不是我的责任。”,"""I'm only a driver and will drive according to the prescribed time and route, and it is not my fault to drop Xiaoming."""
1564,肖师傅觉得自己很委屈，便将此事汇报给其所在的校车公司，经与公司领导商量后决定报警。,"Mr. Xiao felt that he was wronged and reported the incident to the school bus company he belongs to. After discussion with leaders of the company, he decided to call the police."
1565,8月10日，迫于警方压力，宫某到鄂州市公安局梁子湖分局梧桐湖派出所投案自首。,"Due to pressure from the police, Mr. Gong surrendered himself to the Wutonghu police station of the Liangzihu branch of the Ezhou Municipal Public Security Bureau on August 10."
1566,同时，对涉摩涉电车辆的生产、销售、修理、改装、拼装窝点及门店进行清理。,"Meanwhile, dens and stores involving production, marketing, repair, modification and assembly of motorcycles and electric bikes will be eliminated."
1567,值得注意的是，对于涉摩涉电车辆在公交站、地铁口等公共场所聚集等候、兜客揽客的，警方一律以扰乱公共场所秩序予以行政拘留。,"It's noteworthy that the police will place riders of motorcycles and electric bikes who gather at bus stations, subway entrances and other public places to wait for, pick up and attract passengers under administrative detention without exception on charges of disturbing order at public places."
1568,近六年，托管规模年平均增长率达52.89％，业务范围囊括了基金、保险、信托、银行理财、养老金、跨境投资、社会公益、交易支付等多个领域。,"The custody business had achieved an average annual growth rate of 52.89% in the past six years, covering fund, insurance, trust, bank financial management, pension, cross-border investment, social welfare, transaction payment and many other sectors."
1569,中国银行业协会秘书处负责人黄润中表示，资产托管已成为连接货币市场、资本市场和实体经济的重要纽带，也是保障金融安全的重要制度安排。,"Huang Runzhong, head of the Secretariat of the China Banking Association, said asset custody has become an important link connecting the money market, capital market and real economy. It is also an important institutional arrangement to guarantee financial security."
1570,随着我国直接融资市场和财富管理市场的飞速发展，资产托管的市场地位日益提升。,"Along with rapid development of China's direct financing market and wealth management market, the asset custody market has played an increasingly important role."
1571,《中国资产托管行业发展报告（2016）》数据显示，截至2015年底，我国存托比达62.74％，而2011年末存托比仅为17.11％。,"Data from the report on development of China's asset custody industry in 2016 showed that the ratio of assets under custody to deposits reached 62.74% at the end of 2015, versus 17.11% at the end of 2011."
1572,存托比是托管资产占金融机构存款总量的比重，通常被用来衡量托管行业的地位和作用。,The ratio of assets under custody to total deposits of financial institutions is often used to measure the status and function of the custody sector.
1573,值得注意的是，目前我国资产托管机制并不健全，许多领域并没有严格实行托管机制，甚至没有纳入托管。,"It's noteworthy that China's asset custody mechanism is defective presently. Many sectors have failed to strictly enforce the custody mechanism, or even failed to be placed under custody."
1574,P2P网络借贷、私募股权基金等领域风险事件的爆发，资产托管机制的缺乏是一个重要原因。,"The absence of asset custody mechanism is one of the major reasons to explain the outbreak of risk events in P2P online lending, private equity funds and other sectors."
1575,报告建议，应尽快实现全机构、全资产、全流程的“全托管”模式，以更好地保障金融安全，维护投资者利益。,"The report proposed to realize the ""complete custody"" model, which covers the entire institution and features all assets and complete processes, in a push to better guarantee financial security and maintain investors' interests."
1576,各个P2P平台现在都要提取巨额的风险准备金，作为资产，营改增之后是不能抵扣的。,"Currently all P2P platforms will draw huge amounts of loan loss provisions, the value-added tax of which is not deductable as assets after the reform of replacing business tax with VAT."
1577,近日，我市举办互联网金融行业财税专题培训会，财税专家向深圳互联网金融企业建议。,"Shenzhen recently held a special training on finance and tax for the Internet finance industry, with finance and tax experts offering suggestions to the city's Internet finance enterprises."
1578,在由深圳市互联网金融协会主办、深圳市注册税务师协会协办的培训会上，我市互金企业在财税方面遇到的众多难题成为大家关注的重点。,"The numerous problems faced by the city's Internet finance enterprises in finance and tax were thrust into the spotlight during the training session, which was hosted by the Shenzhen Internet Finance Association and co-organized by the Shenzhen Certified Tax Agents Association."
1579,“在行业跑路之风盛行下，P2P平台提取巨额的风险准备金，无疑是稳定投资者军心的重要手段。”,"""As cases of absconding with funds occur frequently in the industry, P2P platforms' drawing of hue loan loss provisions has undoubtedly become an important means to stabilize investors' confidence."""
1580,深圳君合信财税服务机构总裁胡绵鹏表示，作为企业自行提取的风险准备金，如果没有支付，就要缴纳增值税，这是一笔不小的税赋。,"Hu Mianpeng, President of the Shenzhen Junhexin Finance and Tax Service Agency, said that if enterprises don't pay the loan loss provisions they have drawn, they need to pay a considerable amount of added-value tax."
1581,“但是如果与保险企业协商，由保险公司设立这样一个产品，P2P平台去购买，就可以用于增值税抵扣了，企业的成本将降低。”,"""But if P2P platforms negotiate with insurance enterprises to purchase the specific product launched by the latter, it could be used for VAT deduction, and then the enterprises' costs will be reduced."""
1582,胡绵鹏建议，深圳作为互联网金融先行先试城市，可由行业协会与保险企业协商，进行前瞻性尝试。,Hu advised that the Shenzhen Internet Finance Association could negotiate with insurers to make a forward-looking attempt in the pilot city of the Internet finance program.
1583,当前A股市场出现新剧情：大盘在一片看空声中重上3000点，而在这背后，一边是散户情绪仍然低迷，另一边，外资却连续7个月买入A股。,"Something new has been seen in the Chinese A-share market presently - the stock index bounced back to 3,000 points amid a widespread bearish sentiment. Behind this, retail investors' sentiment remained subdued, while foreign investors have increased their holdings of A shares for seven consecutive months."
1584,股民老陈对武汉晚报记者说：“我对3000点之上的行情信心不足，对于大扩容发新股还是怕怕的。”,"""I'm less confident in the stock market above 3,000 points, and feel jittery about the expansion of new share issue"", elder stock investor Mr Chen told journalists of Wuhan Evening News."
1585,市场的核心变化在于，A股市场在经历了2015年异常波动之后，进入震荡市，诸多事件悬而未决，市场资金面整体延续疲弱态势，赚钱难度非常大。,"Core changes of the market become the lingering volatilities surrounding the A-share market after the abnormal fluctuations in 2015, with many issues pending. Money supply in the market remained weak, making it very hard to earn money."
1586,光大证券报告指出：整体上看，7月份个人投资者情绪仍然低迷，个人新增资金持续下降。,"An Everbright Securities report indicated that as a whole, the investment sentiment remained subdued in July, with new funds from individuals being on the decrease."
1587,7月证券市场交易结算资金余额减少额较6月大幅降低，银证转账变动净额为-666亿元。,"The decrease of transaction settlement fund balance in the securities market in July was smaller than that in June, while the net bank-securities transfers stood at negative RMB 66.6 billion."
1588,从新增投资者数量上看，7月新增投资者数量仍然维持在周均31万人的较低水平。,"As for the number of new investors, there were about 310,000 new investors each week in July, which still stayed at a low level."
1589,而沪股通等外资延续净流入，7月沪股通资金净流入87亿元，净流入规模较上月有所扩大。,"Northbound Trading Link (NTL), which has seen continuous net inflow of foreign capital, recorded a net capital inflow of RMB 8.7 billion in July, higher than the previous month."
1590,外资连续买入A股，也间接表明当前A股市场的内生吸引力在逐步增强。,Foreign investors' increased holding of A shares also implies the growing attraction of the current A-share market.
1591,对于散户来说，沪港通资金长时间持续流入后，沪指的表现都很不错。,"For retail investors, the Shanghai Composite Index fared well thanks to the continuous inflow of funds to the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect for a long time."
1592,在操作上，建议关注几个变化：一深港通开通预期带来的变化；二是半年报和三季报信息带来的热点催化作用。,There are a few changes deserving attention in terms of operation: 1) changes expected to be brought by launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect; 2) the catalysis effect arising from announcement of interim reports and third-quarter reports.
1593,目前，新加坡已成为我市跨境人民币结算仅次于香港和台湾地区的第三大境外地域。,"Currently Singapore has become the city's third largest overseas destination for cross-border RMB settlement, second only to Hong Kong and Taiwan."
1594,这些试点政策的推进落实，为支持中新（重庆）战略性互联互通示范项目建设、促进内陆开放发展，提供了良好的金融服务环境。,Implementation of these pilot policies has created a good financial service environment for construction of the China-Singapore (Chongqing) strategic interconnection demonstration project and promoting inland area opening-up and development.
1595,"因为每年申请情况会有变化,落户分值和落户规模年度间可能会有所不同。","As the application situation changes every year, the settlement threshold and scale are likely to vary from the previous year."
1596,"管理办法还规定,实行积分落户公示制度,积分达到规定分值的申请人,要经过公示环节才能落户。","The administrative measures also stipulated that under the rating-based settlement publicity mechanism, applicants who have got the qualified rating need to make publicity before settlement."
1597,"对于政策实施过程中弄虚作假的单位和个人,将被取消当年及以后5年的申请资格,已经落户的也将予以注销。","Units and individuals who falsify in the process of policy implementation will be disqualified for application in the same year and the next five years, and the settlement will be cancelled as well."
1598,"公安机关对案件进行侦查的阶段,昔日的两个合作公司以及一方公司的董事长、共同开发的酒店公司,四方“当事人”就案件中涉及的问题签订“协议书”。","When the public security organ investigated the case, four relevant parties, namely, two former cooperation companies, the chairman of one of the two companies and the jointly-established hotel company, signed an ""agreement"" over problems in the case."
1599,"在协议的履行阶段,两方当事人又将另两方告上法庭,请求法庭确认“协议书”无效。","During performance of the agreement, the two parties brought each other to court again, petitioning the court to affirm invalidity of the ""agreement""."
1600,"近日,内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔市海拉尔区人民法院对本案作出裁定。","Recently, the People's Court of Hailar District, Hulunbeier City, Inner Mongolia, ruled on the case."
1601,内蒙古呼伦贝尔市中威房地产开发有限公司与中青港联(北京)投资有限公司合作开发了房地产项目——呼伦贝尔世纪天伦宾馆。,"Inner Mongolia Hulunbeir Zhongwei Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. and Zhongqing Ganglian (Beijing) Investment Co., Ltd. jointly developed a real estate project - Hulunbeir Shiji Tianlun Hotel."

1603,"中青港联(北京)公司、世纪天伦宾馆公司同意董某在履行完毕本协议的相关义务后,到公安机关申请撤销该案件,并不再追究董某及相关人员的法律责任。","Zhongqing Ganglian (Beijing) and Shiji Tianlun Hotel agreed that Mr. Dong would apply for withdrawing the case with the public security organ after performing the obligations prescribed in the agreement, and they will no longer hold Mr. Dong and other related personnel responsible for legal liabilities."
1604,"董某善意全面履行协议约定后,中青港联(北京)公司、世纪天伦宾馆公司放弃追究中威公司、董某及其他责任人刑事责任、民事责任的权利。","After Mr. Dong fully performs the agreement, Zhongqing Ganglian (Beijing) and Shiji Tianlun Hotel will announce a waiver of rights to hold Zhongwei Real Estate Development, Mr. Dong and other related persons liable for criminal and civil responsibilities."
1605,"这份签订于2014年4月24日的“协议书”中称,四方协商一致,就董某及其下属工作人员侵占、挪用的款项归还一事达成协议。","According to the ""agreement"" signed on April 24, 2014, the four parties agreed to reach an agreement over fund embezzlement and appropriation by Mr. Dong and his subordinate staff."

1710,有记者问，据报道，今天在中国钓鱼岛西北海域约70公里处发生一起中国渔船和外籍货轮碰撞事故，中日双方均派出公务船只对落水人员进行搜救。,A reporter asked that one Chinese fishing boat reportedly collided with a foreign cargo vessel at the waters about 70 kilometers northwest to China's Diaoyu Island today and both China and Japan sent official ships for search and rescue of the personnel overboard.
1711,目前，6名中国船员被救起，中日两国公务船正在全力搜救其余落水船员。,"Currently six Chinese sailors have been saved, while official ships of the two countries are striving to search and rescue the other sailors."
1712,"本报讯每年盛夏夜晚,很多人就开始关注起英仙座流星雨的莅临。","According to the newspaper, many people would look forward to Perseids in midsummer evenings every year."
1713,昨天，大河报记者从河南省妇女儿童活动中心天文馆了解到，今年英仙座流星雨将在北京时间今晚9点到13日凌晨1点30分达到极大值。,Reporters of Dahe Daily learned yesterday from the planetarium of the Henan Province women and children's activities center that the Perseids will reach its maximum from 9:00pm tonight to 1:30am on August 13 this year.
1714,据天文馆馆长李德范介绍，由于受到木星引力的影响，2016年的英仙座流星雨峰值流量，比往年还要高一些，预计可达到每小时150颗。,"According to introduction of Li Defan, director of the planetarium, due to impact of gravitation from Jupiter, the peak flow of the Perseids will be higher than that of the previous years, which is expected to reach 150 meteors per hour."
1715,英仙座流星雨是北半球三大流星雨之一，也是最适宜观测的流星雨。,"Perseids is one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, and is most suitable for observation."
1716,“欣赏流星雨需要找一个满天繁星的地方，远离城市灯光污染。”,"""The view of meteor showers needs a place which is far away from light pollution in the urban area and has a starry sky."""
1717,李德范表示，英仙座是秋夜星空的一个著名星座，8月12日夜从东北方向升起，流星雨的流星看起来从英仙座辐射而出，划向各个方向。,"Li Defan said Perseus is a well-known constellation in autumn's starry sky and will arise in the northeast in the evening of August 12, with meteors seemingly radiating from the Perseus to different directions."
1718,今天（12日），北京有阵雨或雷阵雨，天气依然闷热，出行请注意防范。,"Beijing will encounter showers or thunderstorms today (August 12), but the weather will remain hot. Citizens should take proper precautions before going out."
1719,今天白天，北京最高气温31℃，有阵雨或雷阵雨，闷热感仍然不会消退。,"The highest temperature will hit 31℃ in Beijing during the day today. There will be showers or thunderstorms, but the sultry weather will continue."
1720,气象专家提醒，“闷热天”公众应避免运动量过大，注意多喝水，做好防暑工作。,"Weather experts reminded that citizens should not take a lot of sports during sultry weather, and should drink more water to prevent heatstroke."
1721,在北京故宫建造之初，就对排水系统进行了精准测量、精密设计和精细施工。,"The drainage system of the Forbidden City has been precisely measured, designed and constructed when it was built."
1722,故宫的地面顺应北京地区地理环境特点，整体走势呈北高南低、中间高两边低，而且略有坡度。,"Ground of the Forbidden City complies with characteristics of the geographical conditions in Beijing, appearing higher in the north and lower in the south while higher in the middle and lower on both sides. In addition, it is on a little down slope."
1723,其中北门神武门地平标高46.05米，南门午门地平标高44.28米，南北地平高差约2米，这一坡降为自然排水创造了有利条件，使积水能缓慢排泄。,"The elevation of the Gate of Divine Prowess to the north and the Meridian Gate to the south stands at 46.05 meters and 44.28 meters, respectively, generating a difference of about two meters in ground height. This slope has created advantages for natural drainage so that the ponding could drain slowly."
1724,并且故宫的排水系统十分庞大，保留至今的古代雨水沟的长度超过15公里，其中暗沟长度将近13公里。,"The Forbidden City's drainage system is very huge. The reserved ancient rain gutter measures more than 15 kilometers in length, while the subdrain is as long as nearly 13 kilometers."
1725,而故宫内的排水沟渠全部通向内金水河，内金水河又与故宫城墙外侧52米宽的护城河相连，并同周边的外金水河、中南海等水系相通。,"All draining canals inside the Forbidden City lead to the Inner Golden Water River, which connects with a 52-meter-wide moat outside the Forbidden City, and is linked to the Outer Golden Water River and other water systems in Zhongnanhai."
1726,在历次检修排查中，故宫的工作人员都对破损构件及时进行了更换，确保在雨天排水通畅。,Staff of the Forbidden City have replaced the damaged components in time in the overhauls and checks in a bid to guarantee a smooth drainage in rainy days.
1727,外界认为，在海峡交流基金会董座与高阶人事出炉前，过去肩负两岸与对美日等国讯息传递管道的两大基金会，角色将更为吃重。,"The role of the two major foundations, which served as a message transmission pipeline across the Straits and between Taiwan and countries like the U.S. and Japan in the past, is believed to be more important before Chairperson and senior executives of the Straits Exchange Foundation were nailed down."
1728,邱垂正昨日下午在台陆委会例行记者会针对记者的提问，作了上述表示。,Chiu Chui-cheng made the remark when answering questions raised by reporters in the regular press conference of the Mainland Affairs Council yesterday afternoon.
1729,他说，台陆委会非常重视相关智库的两岸研究成果，并会做为“施政”参考。,"He said that the Mainland Affairs Council has attached much importance to research results of the related think tank on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, and will take them as a reference for ""governance""."
1730,但台当局目前最重要的努力就是做好“一轨的官方沟通互动”，全力维护好两岸现有机制。,"Yet, currently the top priority of Taiwan authorities is to carry out ""sound official communication and interactions"", in a push to maintain the existing mechanism across the Straits."
1731,邱垂正进一步表示，特别是涉及公权力事项，仍须透过公权力与官方的对话协商机制，才能照顾台湾利益，以及落实保障民众的权益与福祉。,"Chiu Chui-cheng added that public power issues, in particular, still need to be addressed through the dialogue and negotiation mechanism between public power and the authority for the best interest of Taiwan and the public."
1732,此外，针对上海与台北共同举办的“双城论坛”，邱垂正表示，两岸城市交流、良性互动有助彼此了解，并增进两岸城市经济、教育、文化、观光各项发展。,"In addition, as for co-launch of the Shanghai-Taipei City Forum, Chiu said urban communications and benign interactions across the Straits could help enhance understanding, and boost development of urban economy, education, culture and tourism."
1733,台陆委会将持续关注交流情形，加强与地方政府联系，并提供必要协助。,"The Mainland Affairs Council will keep a close eye on development of the communication, strengthen contacts with local governments and provide necessary assistance."
1734,记者从中国铁路总公司获悉，8月12日，北京至沈阳高速铁路跨长春至深圳高速公路特大桥顺利合龙。,The reporter learned from China Railway that the bridge of the Beijing-Shenyang high speed railway across the Changchun-Shenzhen Expressway had a successful closure on August 12.
1735,北京至沈阳高铁跨长深高速公路特大桥全长760米，施工工艺复杂，技术要求高，是京沈高铁辽宁段的控制性工程。,"The Beijing-Shenyang high speed railway across the Changchun-Shenzhen Expressway is as long as 760 meters, and features complicated construction technology and high technical requirements. It is a dominant project of Liaoning section of the Beijing-Shenyang high speed railway."
1736,自2014年7月开工建设以来，各参建单位和广大铁路建设者科学组织施工，大力开展科技创新，确保了工程安全顺利推进。,"All construction units and the vast railway builders have carried out construction in a scientific and innovative manner since the project was commenced in July 2014, ensuring the project to proceed safely and smoothly."
1737,这一大桥的合龙，为京沈高铁整体工程建设顺利推进奠定了坚实基础。,Closure of the bridge has laid a solid foundation for construction of the Beijing-Shenyang high speed railway to progress smoothly.
1738,北京至沈阳高铁自北京铁路枢纽引出，经河北省承德市，辽宁省朝阳、阜新市后接入沈阳铁路枢纽沈阳站，全长698公里。,"The Beijing-Shenyang high speed railway extends from the railway terminal in Beijing, and passes Chengde in Hebei Province as well as Chaoyang and Fuxin in Liaoning Province. It measures 698 kilometers in length."
1739,“别看现在河面和桥面的落差有4米多，山洪下来的时候，河水都漫过桥面了。”,"""Even though there is a more than four-meter drop between the river and the bridge, water will flow over the bridge in the case of flash floods."""
1740,8月10日，在霍山县落儿岭镇的响水河边，该镇副镇长金名盛边说边比划。,"Jin Mingsheng, Deputy Town Chief of Luoerling Town, Huoshan County, made the remark while gesturing by the Xiangshui River on August 10."
1741,“在1个多月前的洪灾中，河岸一侧的堤坝垮塌了，不少石块和泥沙都滚落到河道中。,"""In the flood more than one month ago, the dam on one side of the river collapsed, with massive stones and washings rolling into the river."
1742,现在我们打算用水泥浇筑堤坝，这样防洪护岸会更坚固，可以抵御50年一遇的洪水。”,"We're now planning to infill the dam with cement, and the flood prevention bank will be solid enough to withstand the worst flooding in 50 years."""
1743,金名盛说，“工人们现在正在制模，再过1个月，工程基本可以完成了。”,"""Workers are moulding, and the project can be basically completed in another month"", said Jin Mingsheng."
1744,“就拿这段防洪护岸来说，洪水一来，堤坝随时可能垮塌；一旦垮塌，洪水就会冲进沿岸群众的家里。现在我们用水泥浇筑了坚固的堤坝，洪水到来时，就可以更从容地转移沿岸群众，减少群众财产损失。”,"""Take this flood prevention bank for example, the dam may collapse at any moment when flood hits, and the flood would rush into houses of residents living along the bank. Now we use cement to infill a solid dam so that we could transfer residents along the bank with ease in the case of flooding in a bid to reduce property losses."""
1745,淘书、品书、藏书是我业余时间的一个爱好，在我的书房里，杂志创刊号的收藏是一个不断扩充的专题门类。,"One of my hobbies is to buy, appreciate and collect books, and the collection of the initial issues of magazines is a growing special category in my study room."
1746,1992春天，邓小平同志发表南巡讲话，推动新一轮改革开放在中华大地如火如荼地开展，这本杂志的封面就很好地反映出当年的时代背景。,"Comrade Deng Xiaoping made the South Inspection Speech in the spring of 1992, pushing the new round of reform and opening-up to carry out in full swing in the country, and the cover of this magazine has well reflected the historical background of the year."
1747,封面正上方是邓小平同志探身向前在部署改革开放的战略规划，显示出意志坚定、义无反顾的伟人风范。,"In the upper part of the cover, Comrade Deng Xiaoping is seen leaning forward to make strategic planning for the reform and opening-up campaign, highlighting his determination and last-ditch demeanor as a great man."
1748,封面下方是旭日中正在建设的深圳特区，还有来来往往的市民正在为工作奔忙。,"Beneath the cover, it is the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, which was under construction against the rising sun, and citizens are seen hustling for their work."
1749,我收藏的，就是建国后两度复刊时的创刊号，它们从一个侧面反映出，中国工人始终站在时代前列，为社会发展贡献力量并引领时代的前进步伐。,"What I collect is the initial issues of magazines published during the country's two times of publication resumption after its founding. They reflect that Chinese workers are always in the forefront of the times, contribute to social development and lead progress of the times."
1750,数据显示，目前神农架每年游客约70万人次左右，根据专业统计分析，神农架年游客量不宜突破80万人次，否则有损景区资源与环境。,"Data showed that currently Shennongjia receives around 700,000 visitors each year, while professional statistical analysis found that it is inadvisable for Shennongjia to receive more than 800,000 visitors each year, which may damage resources and environment of the scenic spot."
1751,据预测，随着申遗成功，来神农架旅游的中外游人将大增，神农架不追求游客及旅游收入“多多益善”，而是及时预警，值得点赞。,"It is predicted that the number of visitors from home and abroad to Shennongjia will surge after it is inscribed to the World Heritage List, while Shennongjia made an early warning against the visitor number rather than blindly pursuing growth in the tourist number and income, which is laudable."
1752,这是保护神农架生态环境的必要举措，是实现人与自然、人与景区资源和谐相处的可持续旅游之路。,"It is a necessary measure to protect the ecological environment of Shennongjia, and also a sustainable tourism road to realize the harmony between man and nature as well as man and resources in scenic spots."
1753,神农架申遗成功后，成为中国第一个、全球第二个获得世界遗产、人和生物圈保护区、世界地质公园三大殊荣的遗产地。,"After being made World Heritage, Shennongjia has become the first heritage site in China and the second across the world to obtain three major honors, namely, the World Heritage, the Man and Biosphere Reserve and the World Geopark."
1754,不仅如此，神农架又是长江和汉水的分水岭，境内有香溪河、沿渡河、南河和堵河4个水系。,"In addition, Shennongjia forms the watershed between the Yangtze River and the Han River, and covers a total of four water systems, namely, Xiangxi River, Yandu River, Nanhe River and Duhe River."
1755,“山脚盛夏山顶春，山麓艳秋山顶冰，赤橙黄绿看不够，春夏秋冬最难分”是神农架独具和典型的气候特征。,"The proverb that ""Mountain foot and top always see different seasons - midsummer against spring or autumn against winter, with the four seasons being difficult to distinguish"" has highlighted the unique and typical climatic features of Shennongjia."
1756,由此及彼，神农架不搞过度开发，通过可持续旅游保护生态环境的做法，非常值得其它世遗景点学习与借鉴。,"Thereout, Shennongjia's practice of promoting sustainable tourism to protect ecological environment rather than pursuing overexploitation is worth learning and referring to by other World Heritage scenic spots."
1757,神农架是我国第50个世界遗产，中国已成为世界第二遗产大国，要让50处世界遗产熠熠生辉，永远传承下去，走向永恒。,"Shennongjia stands out as the 50th World Heritage of our country, and China has become the second biggest country in terms of the number of World Heritage it secures. We shall strive to make the 50 World Heritages glow and pass them on to the future generations."
1758,目前，不少遗产地还存在“重申报、轻保护，重开发、轻管理”等问题，世界遗产变成“摇钱树”。,"For the time being, many heritage sites have been found ""taking the application seriously but making light of preservation and protection, taking the exploitation seriously but making light of management"", turning the World Heritage into a cash cow."
1759,很明显，如果单纯用经济眼光看待申遗，把遗产当作“金饭碗”，那么再好的遗产也是前途渺茫。,"Obviously, if the application for World Heritage is viewed from the economic perspective, a heritage will be taken as a ""golden bowl"", while its future will look grim no matter how good it is now."
1760,这方面中外都有前车之鉴，如在2010年世界遗产大会上，中国有6处世界遗产被黄牌警告，主要是过度开发导致遗产地生态环境发生变化。,"There are many past experiences to learn from at home and abroad; for instance, six World Heritage sites in China received yellow card warning at the Session of the World Heritage Committee held in 2010 mainly due to the change of ecological environment after overexploitation."
1761,重庆动物园动物管理科副科长唐家桂告诉记者，在野外，雌性大熊猫如果产下双胞胎幼崽，通常会忽视或拒绝较弱的一只，选择较强壮的一只进行哺育。,"Tang Jiagui, deputy chief of the animal management department at Chongqing Zoo, told the reporter that if a female panda gives birth to twins in the wild, it would usually choose to feed the stronger one but neglect or turn down the weaker one."
1762,现在幼崽每隔6小时就要进食一次，在喂奶时必须将双胞胎分开哺育，否则“兰香”会出现抵触。,"Now the baby pandas need to be fed every six hours, while they have to be separated when being fed, or else, their mum ""Lan Xiang"" will react defensively."
1763,正在香港访问的菲律宾总统特使、前总统拉莫斯结束访港行程，今天(12号)下午一点多搭乘菲航班机返回菲律宾。,"Ramos, a former Philippine president and a special envoy to China, wrapped up his visit to Hong Kong and returned to the Philippines by Philippine Airlines at around 1:00pm today (August 12)."
1764,"拉莫斯在离开香港前发表声明，形容早前在香港与老朋友的会面气氛友好愉快,双方以私人身份探讨了如何推进中菲之间的和平与合作。","Ramos made a statement before leaving Hong Kong, saying that he had a friendly and happy meeting with his old friends in Hong Kong, and they discussed how to advance peace and cooperation between the two countries as individuals."
1765,他又委婉回应指，自己这次非“破冰”，但相信可以为中菲关系带来转机。,"He also euphemized that even though it was not an ice-breaking visit, it could bring a turnaround to the Sino-Philippines relations."
1766,拉莫斯在声明中表示，傅莹与吴士存两人是以私人身份出席，进行了非正式讨论。,Ramos indicated in the statement that Fu Ying and Wu Shicun attended the meeting as individuals to have informal discussions.
1767,中国方面已经表达了欢迎拉莫斯以菲律宾总统特使身份访问北京的意愿。,China has expressed its welcome to Ramos' will of paying a visit to Beijing as a special envoy to China.
1768,而拉莫斯表示，菲律宾政府愿意在合适的时机，与中国政府就双方共同关心的问题举行正式会谈。,Ramos said that the Government of Philippines is willing to have a formal talk with the Chinese Government on issues of common concern at the right time.
1769,拉莫斯在总结记者会上也强调，会面没有涉及任何有关南海岛屿争议的具体议题。,Ramos also emphasized at the sum-up press conference that no concrete issues about disputes arising from the South China Sea were discussed during the meeting.
1770,拉莫斯：我们没有讨论(南海岛礁)具体议题，除了谈到公平的捕鱼权利，我们的声明中也有提到。,"Ramos: We didn't cover the concrete issues about the South China Sea, except for the fair fishing rights, which we also mentioned in the statement."
1771,拉莫斯又开玩笑指，这次香港行不是破冰之旅，但相信可以为中菲关系带来转机。,"Ramos also joked that even though it was not an ice-breaking visit to Hong Kong, it could bring a turnaround to the Sino-Philippines relations."
1772,拉莫斯：前内政部长阿农南说，这次来香港的任务是来破冰的，但看起来香港夏天并没有冰可以破。,"Ramos: Former Interior and Local Government Secretary Alunan said that this visit to Hong Kong was originally for the purpose of ice breaking, but it seemed that there was no ice to break in the summer in Hong Kong."
1773,对于下一轮接触何时可以登场，拉莫斯称这取决于总统杜特尔特的决定，以及事态的发展，最快有望在9月登场，但与会人选还没有确定。,"As for time of the next meeting, Ramos said it will be decided by the President Duterte as well as development of the situation. It will be held in September at the soonest, but the candidates have not been nailed down yet."
1774,根据公告，尼日尔首都尼亚美和蒂拉贝里地区受灾较为严重，暴雨导致大量农田和公路桥梁等基础设施受损。,"According to the announcement, Niger's capital Niamey and the Tillaberi region were severely affected by the flood, with rainstorm causing damages to massive infrastructure facilities including farmland, roads and bridges."
1775,为应对灾情，尼政府紧急调拨326吨食物援助受灾群众，并计划向灾区提供资金和技术等方面的支持。,"As part of the efforts to cope with the disastrous situation, the Nigerien Government allocated 326 tons of emergency relief food to aid people afflicted by the natural disaster, and planed to provide financial and technical support to the disaster-hit area."
1776,看看8月过去的这10天，整个云南的降雨持续，强雷暴天气成了“主角”。,Continuous rainfall and severe thunderstorms have dominated Yunnan in the first ten days of August.
1777,8月上旬，昆明主城区出现了多次单点性的强降水，昆明地区平均降雨量为82毫米，较历史同期偏多48%。,"The main urban area of Kunming saw several times of single-point heavy rainfall in early August, and the average rainfall stood at 82mm in the city, 48% higher than the same period in the past."
1778,不过从全年来看，今年截至8月上旬末昆明全市平均雨量较历史还是略微偏少。,"Yet, throughout the year, the average rainfall of Kunming by early August was still slightly smaller than that of the previous years."
1779,昨天（8月11日）下午4:30左右云南气象灾害预警地区甚至达到了39个，大多为雷电黄色预警。,"At around 4:30pm on yesterday (August 11), a total of 39 regions in Yunnan received early warnings against meteorological disasters, and most of them were yellow warnings against thunderbolt."
1780,而且云南大部雨势维持，局部地区还产生了局地雷暴、短时强降水、冰雹、大风等强对流性天气。,"The rainfall sustained across much of Yunnan, while some regions had thunderstorm, short-time strong rainfall, hail, gale and other severe convective weather."
1781,昆明主城区的降雨相对前天而言有所减少，雨势也不大，天气温和了许多。,"Rainfall in the main urban area of Kunming decreased compared to the day before yesterday, and was not strong. The weather got warmer."
1782,因为，从省气象台的预报来看，未来3天，昆明的阵雨天气还将持续，气温基本没有变化，都是17～26℃。,"According to forecasts of the provincial meteorological observatory, the showery weather will sustain in Kunming in the coming three days, while the temperature will basically remain unchanged at between 17℃ and 26℃."
1783,近日，市政府对其进行了批复，要求有关区县、单位切实落实，全力保障沿河两岸人民群众生命财产安全。,"The municipal government approved it recently, requiring all related districts and counties as well as units to implement it to fully guarantee the life and property security of people along the river."
1784,长期以来，“中国式过马路”在大街小巷随处可见，行人随意横穿马路、翻越栏杆……很多人见惯不怪，习以为常。,"The ""Chinese style of crossing roads"" can be seen everywhere for a long time, and people have become accustomed to the phenomenon that pedestrians jaywalk and climb over railings recklessly."
1785,从8月15日即下周一开始，交警部门将正式开始使用电子警察抓拍。,The traffic police department will start capturing such traffic irregularities with the help of e-police from next Monday (August 15).
1786,通过触发虚拟感应线圈，电警拍摄三张违法照片，经人工对数据审核确认后录入“道路交通违法系统”，对以上两项违法行为进行处罚。,"The e-police will take a total of three pictures of the pedestrian who touches the virtual induction coil, and the information will be entered into the ""Road traffic offense system"" after being reviewed and verified by man to penalize the two above-mentioned irregularities."
1787,只有所有交通参与者共同遵守交通法律法规，才能从根本上解决城市交通秩序问题。”,It is only when all traffic participants abide by the traffic laws and regulations that the urban traffic order problem could be fundamentally addressed.
1788,美方计划2017年实验“萨德”系统声称为拦截朝鲜导弹,The U.S. plans to test the THAAD system in 2017 over claim to intercept DPRK's missiles
1789,塔斯社援引赛尔的话称，“在几年之内，我们对美国用于拦截短中程导弹的防空反导系统进行了测试。”,ITAR-TASS quoted James Syring as saying that they had tested the Air Defense Advanced Mobile System (ADAMS) of the U.S. for intercepting short- and medium-range missiles in a few years.
1790,“这些测试都成功通过，现在我们打算对这些武器的远程效果进行测试”。,"""The system has passed all these tests, and now we plan to test the long-distance effect of these weapons."""
1791,针对美国在韩国部署“萨德”反导系统，中国外交部表达了强烈不满和坚决反对。,"As for the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) antimissile system by the U.S. in South Korea, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition."
1792,我们要求美韩双方立即停止‘萨德’反导系统部署进程，不要采取导致地区形势复杂化的行动，不要做损害中国战略安全利益的事情。,"We requested the U.S. and South Korea to immediately stop deploying the THAAD antimissile system, never take actions to lead to complicated regional situation and never do things detrimental to China's strategic security interests."
1793,先后砸烂三户村邻家的窗玻璃，还把前来劝阻的两位年迈太婆推倒在地。,"Windows of three neighbors were broken, and two great-grandmothers who came to dissuade him were pushed to the ground."
1794,前日，这名狂燥不已的男子幸被安陆市南城派出所民警及时制伏。,Recently this furious man was brought under control by police of the Nancheng police station in Anlu City in a timely manner.
1795,闻警赶来的安陆市南城派出所民警为了防止小鸣伤及无辜，果断采取措施将小鸣制伏。,"After receiving report, police of the Nancheng police station in Anlu City took decisive measures to subdue Xiao Ming to prevent him from hurting the innocent."
1796,民警调查发现，小鸣的父母均已年过六旬，一家人很少与外界来往，排除了被人引诱嫖娼的可能性。,"Police investigations showed that Xiao Ming's parents have all been aged above 60, and the family rarely dealt with others, and thus the possibility of being induced by others to go whoring could be eliminated."
1797,民警调查时发现，小鸣精神亢奋、言行均异于常人，询问其家人了解到，小鸣一年前便长期“宅”在家中，拒绝与外界接触，也不与人交流。,"The police found through investigations that Xiao Ming was overly elated, and what he said and did was different from ordinary people. They learned after inquiring his family members that Xiao Ming has become indoorsy since one year ago, refusing to contact or communicate with others."
1798,民警怀疑小鸣因久宅家中出现精神障碍导致行为异常，经安陆市精神卫生中心诊治，确认小鸣已不幸患上精神病。,Police suspected that Xiao Ming's abnormal behaviors were due to mental disturbance caused by his long-term staying at home. Anlu mental health center diagnosed that Xiao Ming had developed mental disease.
1799,目前，小鸣已被有关部门送到安陆市精神卫生中心接受免费救治。,Currently Xiao Ming has been sent by the related departments to the mental health center to receive free treatment.
1800,德国联邦移民与难民局最新统计数据显示，德国今年前7个月共迎来24万名难民，比预计的数量大幅减少。,"The latest statistical data from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) showed that Germany had received a total of 240,000 refugees in the first seven months of this year, a sharp decrease from the number expected."
1801,2015年，大量来自中东北非地区的难民涌入德国，当年在德国登记的难民人数超过百万。,"A large number of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa flooded into Germany in 2015, and more than 1 million refugees were registered in Germany in the year."
1802,德国《经济周刊》11日援引该局负责人魏泽的话报道，今年迄今进入德国的难民仅24万人，较预计的要少很多。,"On August 11, WirtschaftsWoche quoted Weise, head of the BAMF, as saying that only 240,000 refugees have entered Germany year to date, far smaller than expectation."
1803,尽管进入德国的难民人数出现下降，但该局的任务依然艰巨，目前有大约50万份避难申请尚未处理。,"Despite the drop in the number of refugees flooding into Germany, the BAMF still has an arduous task. Currently there are still around 500,000 asylum applications left unprocessed."
1804,尽管如此，有越来越多的难民将该局告上法院，其中一些避难申请人已经等待两年以上。,"Even so, an increasing number of refugees have filed lawsuits against the BAMF, and some of the asylum applicants have waited for more than two years."
1805,2015年底，难民状告联邦移民与难民局“不作为”的案子就已接近2300件。,"By the end of 2015, nearly 2,300 cases against ""nonfeasance"" of the BAMF had been filed."
1806,俄央行表示，增长的主要原因是市场对俄经济预期的重新评估等。,Bank of Russia said that the growth was mainly attributable to reassessment of the market expectation on the country's economy.
1807,俄罗斯国际储备包括外汇储备、黄金储备、在国际货币基金组织的储备头寸和特别提款权等。,"The international reserves of Russia include foreign exchange reserves, gold reserves as well as the reserve positions and special drawing rights (SDRs) in the International Monetary Fund (IMF)."
1808,俄罗斯国际储备由俄政府和央行共同支配，主要用于应对经济风险。,"The international reserves of Russia are jointly controlled by the Russian government and the central bank of Russia, and are mainly used for dealing with economic risks."
1809,近年来，由于西方对俄罗斯实施制裁，加之国际油价下跌，俄罗斯经济面临下行压力，国际储备不断减少。,"The international reserves of Russia have been on the decline in recent years amid the downward economic pressure faced by the country due to the Western sanctions against Russia, coupling with the dropping international oil prices."
1810,近年来，好莱坞大片可以说是电影市场当之无愧的主角，它们通常制作精良，众星云集，宣传攻势铺天盖地，似乎每个人都在讨论，结伴去电影院一探究竟。,"Hollywood blockbusters, which are well made, star-studded and hyped, have been featured in the film market in recent years. It seemed that all people are discussing them, and go to cinema to watch them together."
1811,那么，这些大片真的像我们以为的那样，叱咤而来，卷走一片钞票，满载而归吗？,Then is it truly as we thought that blockbusters always rock the cinema and make a bundle of money?
1812,毋庸置疑，好莱坞大片的制作成本每年都在不断攀升，增幅远超过通货膨胀率。,"Undoubtedly, the production costs of Hollywood blockbusters have been surging year by year, and the growth is even far beyond that of the inflation rate."
1813,根据图1中的数据显示，1995年到2004年的10年间，制作成本超过1亿美元的好莱坞电影共60部。,"Data from Chart 1 showed that the number of Hollywood films, which were produced during the decade from 1995 to 2004 and cost over US$100 million, totaled 60."
1814,然而到了接下来的2005年到2015年的11年间，这一数量激增至197部。,While the figure surged to 197 during the 11 years from 2005 to 2015.
1815,高制作数量的猛增意味着电影平均制作成本的节节攀升，这也引起了业界的警惕。,"The sharp increase in film production number indicates a rising production cost on average, which has aroused alert of the industry."
1816,著名导演斯皮尔伯格和卢卡斯曾在一场论坛活动上批评了这个现象：再这样下去，行业将会“内爆”。,"Famous directors Spielberg and Lucas once criticized such phenomenon in a forum activity, saying that if this continues, the industry would ""implode""."
1817,这29部影片中，营销成本占总成本比例最高的是40%，最低的也有24%。,"Among these 29 films, the highest proportion of marketing costs to total costs stood at 40%, while the lowest even reached as high as 24%."
1818,物理拷贝、音像产品的制作及其运输成本为平均每部6780万美元。,"The average costs of physical copy, production of audio and video products and transport reached US$67.8 million for each film."
1819,正确估计所需拷贝和音像产品的数量很重要，尤其是在采取了“可退货”销售政策的DVD市场。,"It is very important to make a correct estimation of the number of copies and audio and video products to be made, especially in the DVD market that adopts the marketing policy of accepting goods return."
1820,2005年时，梦工厂制作了500万套《怪物史莱克2》的DVD，但销售惨淡，直接导致其当季收入目标未能达成。,"In 2005, DreamWorks made 5 million DVD copies of Shrek 2 but found a poor sales market, which made the company fail to realize its income target of the quarter as a result."
1821,这29部电影还会支出平均3660万美元用于收入分成和补偿，基本上都由导演、制片人、编剧、主演等关键主创人员获得。,"An average amount of US$36.6 million needed to be taken out from these 29 films for revenue sharing and compensation among directors, producers, scriptwriters, protagonists as well as other cast and crew."
1822,对好莱坞大制片厂来说，收入分成的机制可以帮助其降低前期财务压力；而对主创人员来说，也是一种激励。,"For Hollywood studios, the revenue sharing mechanism could help them reduce financial pressure in the early stage, while it turns out to be an incentive for the cast and crew."
1823,这29部电影中，盈利的影片平均有9%的收入用于分成，最高的一部达到了18%，即使是亏损的影片也有平均5%左右的收入用于分成。,"Among these 29 films, profitable ones shared 9% of income on average and one even shared as much as 18%, while films that suffered losses also shared around 5% of income on average."
1824,值得注意的是，主创人员会要求参与“收入分成”，而非“利润分成”。,"It is noteworthy that the cast and crew would ask for share the ""revenue"" rather than the ""profit""."
1825,这是由于在好莱坞狡猾的会计系统的运作下，一些原本大赚的电影也可能变为亏损状态。,"Under operation of the tricky accounting system of Hollywood, some films that could have made a bundle may eventually turn out to be in the red."
1826,例如2010年，《哈利波特5》泄露出的一份报告显示，在电影发行两年之后，华纳仍宣称其亏损了1.67亿美元，让利润分成成了一句空话。,"For instance, a report revealed about Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix in 2010 indicated that Warner still claimed two years after distribution of the film that it lost US$167 million in the film, making profit sharing an empty talk."
1827,好莱坞还需要向由各类工作人员组成的公会支付一定的红利，这29部电影平均支付了1176万美元。,"Hollywood also needs to pay a certain amount of bonus to the union formed by various working staff, while these 29 films paid an average of US$11.76 million for that."
1828,此外，好莱坞电影公司的运营成本也会分摊到各部电影中，分摊到这29部电影的是平均1483万美元。,"In addition, the operating costs of Hollywood Pictures would also be shared by films, while these 29 films shared an average of US$14.83 million."
1829,在扣除销售税和影院分成后，片方可以收到北美票房的53%和国际票房的41%，票房收入约为1.69亿美元。,"After deducting the sales tax and gains shared by cinemas, the film company could receive 53% box office sales of the North America and 41% of the world, amounting to around US$169 million."
1830,再扣除用于影院发行的平均9800万美元的营销费用，只剩下约7000万美元。,"After an average marketing expense of US$98 million for distribution was deducted, there was only around US$70 million left."
1831,在家庭音像发行方面，这29部电影平均每部取得了1.343亿美元的收入。,These 29 films each generated an average income of US$134.3 million from distribution of home audio and video products.
1832,除掉平均2190万美元的营销费用和3050万美元的制作成本后，平均净收益为8190万美元，居收入首位，利润率相较影院发行要高很多。,"After deducting the average marketing expense of US$21.9 million and production cost of US$30.5 million, the net income stood at US$81.9 million on average, which topped the income list. Its profit rate was much higher than that of theatrical distribution."
1833,付费电视频道为这些电影创造的收入略高于免费频道，前者平均为1460万美元，后者为1330万美元。,"Paid TV channels created US$14.6 million of income on average for these films, a little bit more than the US$13.3 million created by free-to-air channels."
1834,29部电影中，有约一半的视频点播收入占比低于1%，即便是2011年之后发行的电影，该收入占比也只有4.1%。,"Among these 29 films, about half generated less than 1% of income from video on demand (VOD), and even films released after 2011 only generated 4.1% of income from this business."
1835,好莱坞在构筑这些超级大片的发行体系时，对视频点播仍持有比较保守的态度。,Hollywood still took a relatively conservative attitude toward VOD when building the distribution system of these blockbusters.
1836,衍生开发方面，这29部电影通过授权衍生品开发而创造的收入为平均1150万美元。,"As for derivative development, these 29 films generated an average income of US$11.5 million by authorizing derivative development."
1837,但有几乎2/3的衍生开发收入来自于最顶级的两部超级大片，并且只有1/3的电影在这方面赚得超过100万美元。,"Yet, almost two thirds of the derivative development income came from the top two super blockbusters, and only one third of them earned more than US$1 million from this."
1838,除了上述收入来源外，这些好莱坞大片还有来自飞机播映、音乐等的零碎收入，平均每部不超过270万美元。,"Apart from the sources of income mentioned above, these Hollywood blockbusters still had bits of income from aircraft broadcast and music, which averaged at US$2.7 million at most for each film."
1839,令人意外的是，根据Stephen统计，这29部好莱坞大片的平均利润为1480万美元，利润率仅为3.7%。,"Surprisingly, Stephen's statistics showed that these 29 Hollywood blockbusters generated US$14.8 million of profits on average, while the profit rate only reached 3.7%."
1840,再考虑到漫长的收入回收过程，这个利润率很可能难以打败通货膨胀。,"If the long revenue recovery process is taken into account, this profit rate could hardly beat the inflation."
1841,成本处于最低区间（1亿-1.25亿美元）的电影盈利表现最差，只有1/3挣到了钱。,"Films with costs in the lowest range between US$100 million and US$125 million delivered the worst performance in profitability, and only one third of them earned money."
1842,而成本处于最高区间（超过2亿美元）的电影有3/4都获得了盈利。,"However, three quarters of the films with costs in the highest range of above US$200 million made profits."
1843,核心提示：2014年，杜兰特与耐克公司签下10年价值3亿美元的合同，取代已经到期的7年6000万美元的合同。,"Core prompt: In 2014, Durant renewed his seven-year US$60 million contract with Nike by signing a ten-year contract worth US$300 million."
1844,杜兰特曾效力于NBA的俄克拉何马雷霆队，下一赛季他将身披金州勇士队战袍。,"Durant, who once played for Oklahoma City Thunder in NBA, will go to the Golden State Warriors in the next season."
1845,2015年，单是各类广告便为他带来了3600万美元的收入，他在俱乐部的工资则高达2000万美元。,"He earned US$36 million from advertising endorsement alone in 2015, while his salary in the club was as high as US$20 million."
1846,2014年，他与耐克公司签下10年价值3亿美元的合同，取代已经到期的7年6000万美元的合同。,"In 2014, he renewed his seven-year US$60 million contract with Nike by signing a ten-year contract worth US$300 million."
1847,此外，他还与西班牙对外银行、冰饮Sparkling Ice、酸奶冰淇淋Orange Leaf等建立了合作关系。,"Besides, he also established partnerships with Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, icy cold drink brand Sparkling Ice and yoghurt ice cream brand Orange Leaf."
1848,作为世界排名第一的网球选手，小德有近一半收入来自赛事奖金。,"As the world's number one tennis player, Djokovic has generated nearly half of his income from tournament bonuses."
1849,他拿下了2015年的温网和美网，2016年的澳网及法网冠军，完成了职业生涯的全满贯，去年的比赛奖金总额达到2180万美元。,"He won the Wimbledon Championships and the U.S. Open in 2015 as well as the Australian Open and French Open in 2016, achieving his Career Grand Slam. The total tournament bonuses amounted to US$21.8 million last year."
1850,他在2012年与优衣库所签下的5年代言合同是其主要的赛场外收入。,"He signed a five-year advertising endorsement contract with Uniqlo in 2012, which became his main source of income beyond the field."
1851,2014年，他开始为标致汽车代言，同时也与阿迪达斯、精工腕表和澳新银行合作。,"He became the advertising celebrity of Peugeot in 2014, and forged partnerships with adidas, SEIKO and ANZ Bank."
1852,日媒称，日本外相岸田文雄于8月11日启程前往菲律宾访问，并与该国总统杜特尔特举行会谈，加强双边合作。,"Japanese media said that Japan's foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, left for the Philippines to pay a visit on August 11 and held talks with Rodrigo Duterte, president of the country, to strengthen bilateral cooperation."
1853,日美两国在经济合作等方面急于向菲律宾接近，其意图是想防止菲律宾倒向中国。,Both Japan and the US are eager to keep close touch with the Philippines in the fields including economic cooperation with the intention to prevent the Philippines from swinging to China.
1854,据日本《经济新闻》网站8月11日报道，岸田将在菲律宾南部的达沃市与杜特尔特以及菲律宾外长亚赛举行会谈，这是日本内阁成员首次与杜特尔特会谈。,"According to the report of the website affiliated to Nihon Keizai Shimbun on Aug.11, Kishida will hold talks with Duterte and Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Perfecto Yasay, in Davao, a city in the south of the Philippines. This is the first talk held between a cabinet member of Japan and Duterte."
1855,岸田特意前往杜特尔特的大本营达沃市而非首都马尼拉，是希望尽早就南海问题与菲方确认合作关系。,"Kishida specially went to Davao City, base of Duterte, instead of Manila, the capital, so as to hope to confirm cooperative relationship with the Philippines on the issue of the South China Sea."
1856,克里7月下旬在参加完老挝举办的东盟相关会议后的第二天，便在马尼拉与杜特尔特会面，双方就尊重南海仲裁裁决达成了一致。,"Kerry, on the second day after participating in a relevant conference of the ASEAN held in Laos in late July, met with Duterte in Manila. Both sides reached a consensus on the issue of respecting the arbitration ruling on the South China Sea."
1857,杜特尔特对克里表示：“在进行任何磋商时，仲裁裁决都将成为基础。”,"Duterte told Kerry that ""the arbitration ruling will constitute the base when any negotiation is conducted."""
1858,克里当时表示将向菲律宾政府提供3200万美元援助，岸田也极有可能在11日的会谈中，再次表明为马尼拉南北通勤铁路建设等提供援助。,"Kerry indicated at that time that $32 million would be offered to the government of the Philippines as assistance. It is probable that for the second time, Kishida will express the intention to offer assistance to the construction of the North-South commuter rail in Manila during the talks on August 11."
1859,报道称，日美之所以急于接近杜特尔特，是由于菲律宾正加紧推动与中国的双边磋商。,"According to the report, the reason why both Japan and the US are eager to keep close touch with Duterte is that the Philippines is intensifying its effort to enhance the bilateral negotiation with China."
1860,报道称，美国和日本一直不断加强与菲律宾的合作，美菲2014年签订了新军事协定，时隔25年再次允许美军事实上在菲律宾国内的基地驻扎。,"The US and Japan have been strengthening their cooperation with the Philippines. In 2014, the US and the Philippines signed a new military agreement, which, in fact, again permitted the American troops to station in the Philippines 25 years later, the report said."
1861,黄兴国一行来到位于“8·12”事故现场的环境监测点，实地察看周边环境，了解监测数据情况。,Huang Xingguo and his party came to the environmental monitoring site at the scene of August 12 Accident to conduct an on-site observation of the surrounding environment and understand the monitoring data.
1862,去年9月5日至今，空气中特征污染物未检出，海水质量达到国家一类海水标准，土壤采样检测结果显示与环境背景值无显著差异。,"Since September 5 last year, particular pollutants in the air have not been detected and sea water quality has reached the national first-class sea water standard. Soil sampling test results indicate that there is no prominent difference in comparison with environmental background value."
1863,今年3月以来，每周监测一次，监测结果显示环境质量始终处于安全可控范围，得到来津检查工作的国家环保部专家的充分肯定。,"Since March this year, monitoring has been conducted weekly. The monitoring results show that the environmental quality is safe and controllable, which is sufficiently affirmed by the experts from the Ministry of Environmental Protection who came to Tianjin to inspect the work."
1864,里约奥运会的乒乓球男单金牌，令马龙实现个人职业生涯的大满贯。,The men's single gold medal of the table tennis at the Rio Olympics has made Ma Long realize the grand slam of his personal career.
1865,十年磨一剑，马龙坦言实现梦想非常高兴，也称赞张继科“既是对手也是兄弟”，是他的榜样和动力。,"Like spending a decade in grinding a sword, Ma Long candidly admitted that he was glad to realize his dream and paid a compliment to Zhang Jike, saying Zhang is both an opponent and brother and has become his model and motive force."
1866,马龙年少成名却大器晚成，经历了无缘参加伦敦奥运会单打后，28岁的他终于在里约夺得自己的奥运会首枚单打金牌。,"Though Ma Long rose to fame during his juvenile time, yet he is a late bloomer. Having experienced the men's single that made him to lose the luck to take part in the London Olympic Games, he finally won his first men's single gold medal of Olympics in Rio at the age of 28."
1867,赛后采访时马龙也表示，这枚金牌是职业生涯这么多年的一个“很好的结果”，“打这么多年球，梦想就是获得金牌，能实现非常高兴”。,"When interviewed after the match, Ma Long said that the gold medal is a ""very good result"" achieved in her career of so many years. ""I'm very pleased to realize the dream of winning a gold medal after I have played table tennis for so many years."""
1868,图是在从广州开往宁波的K210次列车上，列车员正在向外籍旅客介绍西湖绸伞等杭州特产，并讲解G20峰会相关知识。,"The photograph shows the K210 train bound from Guangzhou to Ningbo. The conductor is introducing to foreign passengers Hangzhou special local products, for example, West Lake silk umbrellas, and talking about related knowledge of the G20 Summit."
1869,随着杭州G20峰会的临近，网上关于杭州准备工作的讨论也热闹了起来。,"With the G20 Summit in Hangzhou around the corner, the discussion about the preparation for this summit in Hangzhou is beginning to warm up on the Internet accordingly."
1870,8月10日，菲律宾总统杜特尔特再次批评美驻菲大使戈德堡，指责其干涉菲律宾内政。,"On August 10, president of the Philippines, Duterte again criticized Goldberg, US ambassador to the Philippines, for interfering in the internal affairs of the Philippines."
1871,今年4月，在菲律宾总统竞选期间，戈德堡曾就人权问题指责杜特尔特，双方连续发声，言语冲突激烈。,"In this April, during the presidential campaign in the Philippines, on the pretext of the issue of human rights, Goldberg found fault with Duterte. Both sides continuously elucidated their own viewpoints and the speech conflict was intense."
1872,杜特尔特对戈德堡干预选举表示强烈不满，甚至威胁要在当选总统后断绝与美国的关系。,Duterte expressed his strong dissatisfaction with Goldberg's interference in the presidential election and even threatened to sever the relationship with the US after he is elected as president.
1873,5日，杜特尔特旧事重提，再次表达对戈德堡的不满，批评其干涉菲律宾内政。,"On the 5th day of the month, Duterte raked up old stories and again expressed his dissatisfaction with Goldberg, criticizing the latter for interfering in the internal affairs of his country."
1874,菲律宾总统新闻发言人曾说过，总统没有忘记以美国为首的西方殖民者为菲律宾带来的痛苦。,A press spokesman of the president of the Philippines once said that the president did not forget the suffering brought about by US-led Western colonists.
1875,7月底，美国国务卿克里访问菲律宾时，民众聚集在美国驻菲律宾大使馆外集会，手举标牌要求“美军滚出菲律宾”。,"At the end of July, when US Secretary of State Kerry visited the Philippines, the masses gathered outside the US Embassy to the Philippines and held a mass rally. Carrying placards, they demanded that ""American troops go away from the Philippines""."
1876,中国有着灿烂的文明、众多的人口，曾经长期处于世界发展前列，如今成为世界第二大经济体。,"With a splendid civilization and numerous people, China stood at the forefront of the world development for several centuries. Now the country has become the second largest economy in the world."
1877,当我们说出这个词时，其中不仅蕴涵着太多意义，也承载着太多内容。,"Speaking of the word, we realize that it not only implies too much meaning but also carries rich contents."
1878,毫无疑问，此时提出文化自信，是基于中国共产党、中国人民对自身文化价值的充分认同和对其生命力的坚定信心。,"Without doubt, the proposition of setting up cultural self-confidence is based on the sufficient identification of their own culture value as well as the firm confidence in its vitality on the part of the CPC and the Chinese people."
1879,很多人发现，在习近平一系列讲话、文章、演讲、访谈中，中国古代典籍、经典名句俯拾即是，彰显了高度的文化自信，引起了全世界的广泛共鸣。,"Many people have realized that in Xi Jinping's series of talks, articles, speeches and interviews, famous quotations from ancient Chinese books and records as well as classics are found everywhere, manifesting highly cultural self-confidence and arousing the widespread resonance all over the world."
1880,事实证明，伴随着当代中国崛起的，是中华文化影响力吸引力的不断增强。,"Facts have proved that along with the rise of contemporary China, the influence and attraction of the Chinese culture is increasingly being strengthened."
1881,中国100多年的近现代史早就向我们说明，道路、理论和制度无不植根于文化。,"The Chinese modern history of over 100 years has already told us that all the road, theory and system are rooted in the culture."
1882,我们曾向西方学习器物、制度与文化，也在这个过程中不断反思。,"Of course, for a time, we learned from Western countries about their implements, systems and cultures and kept rethinking in this process."
1883,在长长的探索后我们发现，中国走向现代化的坚定信心植根于中华民族的“精神基因”之中。,"After a long-term exploration, we have found that the firm confidence in China's modernization derives from the ""spiritual gene"" of the Chinese nation."
1884,在习近平的讲话和考察中，对包括儒家思想在内的中华优秀传统文化的论述不计其数。,"In Xi Jinping's speeches and investigations, the discussions on excellent traditional Chinese culture including Confucianism are beyond count."
1885,在中共中央政治局第十八次集体学习中，习近平更是强调，中国的今天是从中国的昨天和前天发展而来的。,"In the 18th collective study of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, Xi Jinping all the more emphasized that China's today is just the development of her yesterday and the day before yesterday."
1886,他还说，数千年来，中华民族走着一条不同于其他国家和民族的文明发展道路。,"He also said that for several thousand years, the Chinese nation has taken her civilization development path different from those of other countries and nations."
1887,我们开辟了中国特色社会主义道路不是偶然的，是我国历史传承和文化传统决定的。,"We have not occasionally blazed the socialist road with Chinese characteristics, which is determined by the historical inheritance and cultural tradition of our country."
1888,2010年，中国GDP正式跃居世界第二，但中国不只有经济成就。,"In 2010, China's GDP stood second in the world. However, China' achievements are more than economy."
1889,中共十八大以来，中国把建设社会主义文化强国摆到更加突出的位置，致力于开创文化发展新的“黄金时代”。,"Since the Eighteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China has attached more prominent importance to the construction of a powerful socialist cultural country, dedicated to initiating a new ""golden age"" of cultural development."
1890,无论优秀传统文化、革命文化还是社会主义先进文化，都展现着前所未有的生机活力。,"Either excellent traditional culture, revolutionary culture or advanced socialist culture is demonstrating unprecedented vitality."
1891,尽管中华文化源远流长，也有着非常强劲的发展势头，但也不可否认，其当下的影响和作用远未到达应有的高度。,"In spite of the fact that the Chinese culture is time-honored and has vigorous development momentum, it cannot be denied that its current influence and function are far from reaching its due height."
1892,虽然过去几百年里中国经历过一段失落的时光，但现在已经重回世界舞台，而且是以一种更强大的方式。”,"Though China has experienced a lost time in the past few hundred years, yet now she has returned to the world stage in a more powerful manner."
1893,在接受记者采访时，土耳其副总理穆罕默德·希姆谢克直言，中华文化曾为世界贡献良多。,"While accepting a reporter's interview, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek bluntly said that the Chinese culture has made a lot of contributions to the world."
1894,诚如希姆谢克所言，如今的中国正以全新的方式为世界作出贡献。,"Just as Simsek said, today's China is making contributions to the world in a brand-new way."
1895,近日，江宁板块迎来新一轮的涨价，下半年几家纯新盘首次入市，打算卖出3万/㎡的高价。,"Recently, the Jiangning area has witnessed a new round of real estate price rise. In the latter half of the year, several developers of purely new commercial residential buildings entered the market for the first time, intending to charge the high price of 30,000 yuan per square meter."
1896,而碧桂园·世纪城邦，紧挨江宁，首期均价7088元/㎡，目前首期已全部售罄。,"And the initial average price of Country Garden Century City adjacent to Jiangning is 7,088 yuan per square meter. At present, the commercial houses in the first phase have been sold out."
1897,交通方面，江宁板块现有地铁1号线、地铁3号线、S1号机场线。,"In transportation, at present, the Jiangning area boasts Metro Line 1, Metro Line 3 and Arport Line S1."
1898,而碧桂园·世纪城邦目前已接入至小龙湾地铁站及药科大学地铁站的业主班车，后期随着业主入住的增加，还将增加多个至地铁站的班次。,"Up to now, Country Garden Century City has accommodated scheduled buses to Xiaolongwan Metro Station and Pharmaceutical University Metro Station for proprietors. In the later phase, with the increase of proprietors who will live in the buildings, the number of scheduled buses to metro stations will be increased."
1899,除此之外，碧桂园·世纪城邦还拥有双高铁、禄口机场的交通配套。,"In addition, Country Garden Century City has the transportation facilities such as double high-speed rails and Lukou Airport."
1900,商业方面，江宁被分成七大商圈，分别是东山、九龙湖、百家湖、大学城、三山、岔路口和河定桥，而这七大商圈均离城邦不远。,"In business, Jiangning is divided into seven business areas, such as Dongshan, Jiulong Lake, Baijia Lake, University Town, Sanshan, Chalukou and Heding Bridge, which are not far away from Country Garden Century City."
1901,东郊奥莱整体规划40万方，计划入驻240余种国际时尚品牌，目前已经入驻100多家。,"Outlets in the eastern suburbs has an integrated planning area of 400, 000 square meters, planning to permit over 240 international fashion brands to be stationed. At present, over 100 such brands have entered there."
1902,南京东郊奥莱由顶级奥特莱斯开发管理经验的TOC公司和奥特莱斯发展公司运营管理，1:1复制美国奥莱，每周都会有数以万计的客户前来购物。,"Outlets in the eastern suburbs of Nanjing is jointly run and managed by The TOC Company with the top-notch development management experience of Outlets and The Outlets Development Company, which copies American Outlets in one-to-one proportion. Thousands of customers come here for shopping weekly."
1903,目前，城邦首期已经售罄，新品80-265㎡精装好房火爆认筹中，全城仅限300位享受额外98折优惠，早认筹，先选房。,"At present, the houses in the initial phase of Century City have been sold out. People are eagerly queuing up in lines for purchasing new delicately-decorated houses with housing area of 80 to 265 ㎡ each. Only 300 customers in the city can enjoy the extra 2% discount. Early registration means early selection of houses."
1904,另外需要注意的是，大学新生享受火车票的优惠区间为家庭所在地与学校所在地之间，超出区间则不能享受优惠政策。,"Another thing worth attention is that the range of the preferential railway tickets for college freshmen is between their homes and their universities. Otherwise, they cannot enjoy the preferential policy."
1905,同时，新生凭录取通知书只能购买一次学生票，已经购票的同学如果行程有变，最好选择改签，不要直接退票。,"At the same time, a freshman, on the strength of his or her letter of admission, can only purchase a student ticket once. Those who have bought their tickets had better choose to alter the tickets if their journeys change instead of returning their tickets directly."
1906,如果确实需要退票，可以让工作人员注明火车票已退，以保证可以再次购买学生票。,"If they really need to return their tickets and ask for refunds, they can ask staff members to indicate that the tickets have been returned so as to ensure to purchase student tickets again."
1907,大学新生凭录取通知书购买优惠火车票针对的只是新生本人，同行的其他人则不享受此等优惠。,Only a college entrant himself or herself can purchase a preferential railway ticket via his or her letter of admission. Other people accompanying him or her are not entitled to enjoy the discounted price.
1908,“尽管女性正在承担越来越多的社会角色，但相当多的女性在家庭和社会中缺乏与男性等同的话语权。”,"""Though females are playing more and more social roles, quite a number of them lack the speech right equivalent to that of males in family and society at large."""
1909,该专家表示，因此不少女性都不同程度的存在抑郁、焦虑的情绪，30至40岁是此类疾病的高发年龄段。,The expert said that hence quite a number of females have the feelings of depression and anxiety to different degrees and the high-incidence age-bracket of such diseases is from 30 to 40.
1910,当然，除了患者基数的加大，女性患者增多还源于人们对心理卫生的日益重视。,"Of course, in addition to the increase of the base number of patients, the increase of female patients stems from people's high attention to psychological health."
1911,徐向东表示，以往面对心理问题，生活中很多人群对于心理压力采取“硬扛”或回避的态度。,"According to Xu Xiangdong, facing mental problems, many people in life adopt the attitude of ""dogged resistance"" or avoidance toward psychological pressure."
1912,同时，由于普通市民缺乏对抑郁症、焦虑症的了解，误认为是患者闹情绪，而未能及时给予应有的理解和情感支持，也是就诊率偏低的主要原因。,"At the same time, due to the lack of understanding of depressive disorder and anxiety ailments, common citizens erroneously think that patients are in a fit of pique instead of giving them timely understanding and emotional support, which is also the main reason for a lower outpatient rate."
1913,“而今，随着人们对心理卫生问题的正确理解，和对心理健康的重视，不少患者及其家人能够正确面对病情。”,"""Today, with people's getting a proper understanding of psychological health and paying attention to mental health, many patients and their family members can face the disease in a right manner."""
1914,徐向东说，因此越来越多的患者愿意走进医院，接受专业人员的帮助。,"Xu Xiangdong said that as a result, more and more patients are willing to enter hospitals to accept the help of professionals."
1915,当地时间11日，中国外交部长王毅在乌干达首都坎帕拉与乌外长库泰萨会谈。,"On August 11, local time, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a talk with his Ugandan counterpart in Kampala, capital of Uganda."
1916,王毅在会谈后与库泰萨共见记者时应询表示，无论国际和地区风云如何变幻，非洲国家始终是中国最亲密的好兄弟，而中国始终是非洲国家最可靠的好朋友。,"When jointly meeting the press with Kutesa after holding talks, Wang Yi indicated that whatever the international and regional vicissitudes, African countries have always been China's closest good brothers and China has always been the most reliable friend of African countries."
1917,中国是安理会“五常”中向非洲派遣维和人员最多的国家，现有2400多名中方维和人员在南苏丹、马里等7个非洲任务区执行维和任务。,"Of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, China is a country that has dispatched the largest number of peacekeepers to Africa. Now, over 2,400 Chinese peacekeepers are implementing peace-keeping missions in 7 African task areas including South Sudan and Mali."
1918,仅仅在过去两年，中方就曾两次倡议召开南苏丹问题有关会议，积极支持伊加特斡旋努力，几度提出了中国倡议。,"In the past two years, the Chinese side has twice proposed to hold related conferences on the issue of South Sudan, actively supported the effort of the mediation by IGAD and put forth a China initiative for several times."
1919,中方支持非洲友好国家加强国防维稳能力建设，并通过双多边渠道向有关非洲国家和非盟等地区组织提供援助，支持其在达尔富尔、索马里等地的维和行动。,"The Chinese side supports friendly African countries to strengthen the construction of the ability to maintain stable national defense. In addition, China has offered assistance to relevant African countries and regional organizations such as the AU through bilateral or multilateral channels, supporting their peace-keeping activities in Darfur, Somalia and other places."
1920,中国积极参与联合国在亚丁湾和索马里海域打击海盗和护航行动。,China has actively taken part in the anti-piracy and escort operations conducted by the UN in the Gulf of Aden and waters off Somalia.
1921,自2009年以来，中国共派出23批护航编队，为6000多艘过往船只护航。,"Since 2009, China has dispatched a total of 23 escort fleet and convoyed over 6,000 vessels to and fro."
1922,中国一直支持和帮助非洲自己找到解决问题之道，而有些西方国家是将解决方案强加于非洲。,China always supports and helps Africa to find solutions to problems by itself while some Western countries impose their schemes on Africa.
1923,中国认为消除贫困是避免冲突和危机的钥匙，所以中国在非洲致力于加强友好交往，帮助非洲真正实现可持续的发展。,"China maintains that eradicating poverty is the key to avoiding conflicts and crisis. Therefore, China is dedicated to strengthening friendly exchanges in Africa so as to help Africa to realize sustainable development in a real way."
1924,库泰萨还重申，在安理会改革问题上，乌方坚定支持埃祖尔韦尼共识，这是非盟的共同立场。,"Kutesa reiterated that on the issue of the reform of the Security Council, the Ugandan side firmly supports the Ezulwini Consensus, which is a common stance of the AU."
1925,同时，中方也理解和支持非洲，主张优先纠正非洲国家遭受的历史不公。,"At the same time, the Chinese side also understands and supports Africa, advocating that priority should be given to rectify the historical injustice African countries have suffered."
1926,回到派出所后，民警首先为老人端上一碗绿豆汤让老人喝下，以免老人长时间在高温天气下中暑。,"After returning to the local police station, the policeman first of all offered a bowl of mung bean soup to the old man and told the latter to drink it up for fear that he might suffer heatstroke due to being exposed to the scorching weather for a long time."
1927,随后，民警与其进行耐心交流，终于得知这名老人叫陈某，86岁，是夏张镇南寨村人，由于年纪较大、意识模糊，自己逛着逛着便找不到家了。,"Afterwards, the policeman patiently talked with the old man. At last, he knew that the old man surnamed Chen is 86 years old, a villager of the village of Nanzhai, Xiazhang Town. Due to his old age, the old man was not sober enough so that he could not find his home as he was wandering."

1929,9日傍晚，一群高空架子工安静地坐在光谷步行街的台阶上休息。,"At dusk on August 9, a group of scaffolders working in high-altitude environment were quietly sitting on the steps of Optical Valley Pedestrian Street to have a rest."
1930,这群架子工，被称作“日薪工”，就是雇请他们的老板，在当日干完活后现场兑现工资。,"Also called daily-salary workers, the scaffolders employed by their boss received their salary on the site after completing their work that day."
1931,日渐长高的城市，离不开这群架子工的付出，他们的工作，看似没有技术含量，却很危险。,"The city with more and more high rises cannot do without the efforts made by the scaffolders. Their work, which seems to have no technical content, is very dangerous."
1932,当日上午，他们身穿工装，戴好安全帽，腰别扳手、手拿镙栓枪，在楼宇外侧的钢架上往来穿梭。,"On the morning that day, wearing work clothes and safety helmets, with wrenches in their waists and bolt guns in their hands, they shuttled on the steel frame outside buildings."
1933,来自黄陂的熊国银边说边拿出3天的工钱共1500元向记者展示，说是要寄给老婆。,"While talking, Xiong Guoyin from Huangpi took out 1500 yuan, his three days' pay, saying that he was going to send the money to his wife."
1934,据了解，这些日薪工，按劳动强度每日所得在300-500元之间。,It is known that each of the daily-salary workers can earn 300 yuan to 500 yuan a day according to his labor intensity.
1935,一名熟练的架子工，每天经手的钢管有120根左右，每截钢管8公斤，他们每人每天经手的钢管就重达1吨左右。,"An experienced scaffolder deals with about 120 steel tubes every day, each of which weighs 8 kg. In other words, each scaffolder does with steel pipes weighing as much as 1000 kg a day."
1936,这个工期要结束了，50多岁的吴师傅边点钱边说，自己苦点累点，就为家人过好一点，说到家人时，他浅浅地笑了。,"With the construction duration coming to an end, Master Wu who is over 50 years old was counting his money, saying that he could endure the hardship in order to let his family lead a better life. Speaking of his family, he chuckled."
1937,明日上午，市公安局将在火车站广场举办火车站区域交通环境提升征求市民意见活动。,"Tomorrow morning, the Municipal Public Security Bureau will hold the activity of soliciting opinions from citizens on the improvement of the traffic environment on the square of the railway station."
1938,但是，作为展示西安对外形象的窗口，火车站区域的交通环境仍存在着许多不尽如人意的地方。,"However, as a window showcasing the image of Xi'an to the outside world, there are still a lot of unsatisfactory phenomena as far as the traffic environment around the railway station is concerned."

1941,号称韩国历史上最严厉反腐败法的《金英兰法》将于下月施行，这部法律要求公职人员接受宴请人均费用不得超过3万韩元（约合181元人民币）。,"Known as the sternest anti-corruption law in the history of the Republic of Korea, the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act will come into force next month. According to the law, the expenses per capita of a civil servant who accepts a banquet shall not exceed 30,000 Korea won (approximately RMB 181 yuan)"
1942,韩联社10日报道，这条规定让不少原先专门招待政界人士和高级公务员的韩国高档餐厅面临挑战。,"According to the report by Yonhap on August 10, this stipulation poses a challenge to many first-class Korean restaurants that were originally going to exclusively entertain political figures and senior civil servants."
1943,不少餐厅调整餐费标准，推出更廉价的套餐，有的则干脆关张、改行。,Quite a number of restaurants have to adjust the standard of table money and promote more inexpensive set meals. Some restaurants have closed down or switched to other industries once and for all.
1944,韩联社报道，不少韩国餐馆的老板如今正因《金英兰法》为今后业绩犯愁。,"Many Korean restaurant bosses are worried about their future business because of the law, Yonhap reported."
1945,在首尔仁寺洞，自1969年营业至今的“山川”餐厅常有政界人士、政府官员、媒体记者和商人光顾。,"In Insadong of Seoul, a restaurant which has been doing business since 1969 is often patronized by political figures, government officials, media reporters and merchants."
1946,饭店老板告诉韩联社记者，多年来，他们以向顾客提供高档食品和私人就餐环境而自豪。,The boss of the restaurant told the reporter from Yonhap that for many years they have been proud of offering luxury food and private dining environment to customers.
1947,过去10年间，饭店一直提供高规格的套餐，但“为符合（《金英兰法》所设定的）餐费上限，我们将被迫改变几十年的传统，这真是艰难决定”。,"In the past ten years, the restaurant has offered high-specification set meals. However, ""in order to satisfy the upper limit of table money set by The Improper Solicitation and Graft Act, we will have to change the tradition of several decades, which is really a difficult decision."""
1948,“炭火烤肉村”以牛肉烧烤为主，其总经理金基福说，餐厅招牌菜“韩牛”的价格在5万韩元以上。,"""Charcoal Fire Barbecue Village"" mainly offers beef barbecue. According to its general manager, the price of ""Han-u"" (Korean beef), a signature dish of the restaurant, is over 50,000 Korean won."
1949,“我们预计自10月起销售额会大减，正在考虑把套餐中的韩牛换成进口牛肉”。,"""We predict that from October on, the sales volume will greatly reduce so we are considering replacing Han-u in set meals with imported beef."""
1950,坐落在首尔钟路区的“有情”饭店曾因前总统卢泰愚、李明博等政要的光顾而闻名，却于上个月关张。,"Located in Jongno district, Seoul, the restaurant which was well-known for the patronage by political VIPs such as former presidents Roh Tae-woo and Lee Myung-bak closed down last month."
1951,饭店老板说，随着韩国部分政府机构迁至世宗市，饭店营业额遭受巨大冲击，估计《金英兰法》施行后，客人将更少。,"The boss of the restaurant said that as partial Korean government departments have been moved to Sejong, the restaurant's volume of business has suffered a great shock. It is estimated that after the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act takes effect, the number of guests will be even smaller."
1952,这家饭店不久后将改行经营越南米线，人均餐标在1万韩元左右（60元人民币）。,"Before long, the restaurant will divert to engaging in Vietnam rice noodles and the per capita dining standard is around 10, 000 Korean Won (RMB 60 yuan)."
1953,韩国餐饮服务业联合会预计，《金英兰法》施行后的第一年，韩国酒店行业的收入预计将同比减少4.15万亿韩元（250亿元人民币）。,"According to the prediction of the Korean Catering Service Industry Association, in the first year after the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act is put into force, the income of hotel industry in S. Korea will reduce by 4.15 trillion Korean Won (RMB 25 billion yuan) year on year."
1954,面对可能带来的经济损失，韩国总统朴槿惠10日在一场内阁会议上说，重要的是在保持《金英兰法》核心部分的同时尽可能地减少其带来的负面效应。,"Facing the possible economic loss, South Korean President Park Geun-hye said at a cabinet conference on the 10th day that what is important is to reduce its negative effects as far as possible while sticking to the core part of the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act."
1955,她说：“一旦这部法律施行，社会的透明度和公平性都将有所提升，经济的有效性也将增加，韩国的经济增速也可能因此提升。”,"She said, ""Once the law is put into force, the social transparency and fairness will be more or less improved and the efficiency in economy will increase, too. Therefore, the economic growth of S. Korea will speed up."""
1956,日常行车时，我们常常会通过隧道，有时甚至是超长隧道或隧道群，隧道是否安全对于大家来说非常重要。,"While driving vehicles in our daily life, we often go through tunnels, sometimes even super-long tunnels or tunnel groups. So, whether tunnels are safe is important to us."
1957,同时规定，任何单位和个人不得破坏、损坏、非法占用或者非法利用公路隧道及其附属设施。,"Meanwhile, it is stipulated that no unit or individual shall destroy, damage, illegally occupy or take advantage of highway tunnels and their subsidiary facilities."
1958,养护工程施工需封闭交通或长时间占用行车道时，除紧急情况外，管养单位应在项目开工前15天，联合公安交警部门向社会发布施工及交通管制信息。,"If traffic needs to be closed or a carriageway is occupied for a long time due to the maintenance project, except for emergency situation, the management and maintenance unit shall issue to the public the information of construction and traffic control together with the traffic police department 15 days ahead of time."
1959,很多司机都遇到过隧道内堵车的情形，有人还会在隧道内吸烟来打发时间。,Many drivers have encountered the situation in which traffic jams took place in tunnels. Some drivers are accustomed to smoking cigarettes in a tunnel to kill time.
1960,当公路隧道内出现车辆排队滞留时，公安交警部门应视情况采取禁止车辆驶入、疏导分流等措施，并及时公布拥堵信息。,"When a highway tunnel is experiencing traffic congestion in the form of vehicles queuing, the traffic police department should take measures such as preventing vehicles from entering, guiding and diverting the traffic according to specific situations and issue the information of traffic jam in a timely way."
1961,发生交通事故时，要立即进行交通管制，通过巡逻喊话等措施，严防发生次生事故。,"When a traffic accident takes place, it is imperative to carry out traffic control immediately to keep secondary accidents from happening through measures such as patrol and propaganda."
1962,公安机关可根据公路隧道安全保护要求，结合公路隧道技术条件，指定危化品运输车辆通行线路、通行时间，或禁止危化品运输车辆通行，并向社会公告。,The public security organ can designate the route and the time for vehicles loaded with dangerous chemicals to pass or prohibit such vehicles from passing according to the requirements of the safety protection of highway tunnels and the technical conditions of highway tunnels and issue the notice to the public.
1963,中新网8月12日电国家统计局新闻发言人盛来运今天表示，辽宁的城镇调查失业率数据高于全国平均水平，由于它的经济在调整，内部压力是比较大的。,"According to chinanews.com on August 12, Sheng Laiyun, press spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics said today that the surveyed urban unemployment rate in Liaoning is higher than the national average level. Since its economy is experiencing adjustment, the interior pressure is rather big."

1965,从大环境角度来讲，国际经济处于深度调整，复苏比较缓慢，对中国的出口，包括对辽宁省的出口都会带来较大的压力。,"Judging from the over-all situation, since the international economy is under deep adjustment, its recovery is relatively slow, which will bring about a large pressure on China's import including the import of Liaoning province."
1966,从国内来看，中国正处在结构调整的关键时期，传统产业过剩和市场有效需求成长不足的矛盾还是比较大，传统产业调整的阵痛还在释放。,"Domestically, as China is in the critical period of structural adjustment, the contradiction between the surplus of traditional industries and the inadequacy in the growth of market effective demand is rather acute and the throes caused by the adjustment of traditional industries are still being released."
1967,所以这一轮调整中，恰恰是重化工产品价格调整深度最深，所以不可避免的给辽宁经济带来下行压力。,"Therefore, in this new round of adjustment, it is the price of the products of heavy and chemical industries that is undergoing the deepest adjustment, thus inevitably bringing downward pressure on the economy of Liaoning."
1968,在“十二五”期间，由于城镇化的发展，房地产的扩张，辽宁的基础设施发展的比较好，房地产基数也比较高。,"During the 12th Five-Year Plan, due to the development of urbanization and the expansion of the real estate, the development of infrastructure in Liaoning was sound and the base of its real estate was fairly high."
1969,进入“十三五”以后，这一轮房地产的调整，由于它原来的基数比较高，从数据表现来讲要比其他地区下降得多。,"After entering the period of the 13th Five-Year Plan, since its original base number was high, in terms of data manifestation, this round of adjustment has much more been reduced than other region."
1970,盛来运总结指出，辽宁的经济调整是有特殊的经济原因，既有周期性因素影响也有结构性因素影响，还有基数效应的影响，总体是在调整过程中。,"Sheng Laiyun summarized that the economic adjustment of Liaoning has its special economic reasons, including not only the influence of cyclical factors, but also that of structural factors and even that of base effect and that generally it is in the process of adjustment."
1971,盛来运还介绍，辽宁的城镇调查失业率数据高于全国平均水平，由于它的经济在调整，内部压力是比较大的。,"Sheng Laiyun also revealed that since its economy is being adjusted, the fact that the urban unemployment rate of Liaoning is higher than the national average level indicates that its interior pressure is rather big."
1972,从近两个月数据观察看，辽宁经济有企稳的迹象，指标降幅在收窄。,"According to the observation of the data in the recent two months, there is an indication that the economy of Liaoning will be stabilized and the index reduction degree is becoming narrow."
1973,我们相信在各方面的共同努力下，包括辽宁在内的东北地区的经济会再现往日老工业基地的雄风。,"We believe that through the joint efforts of all aspects, the economy in the northeastern region including Liaoning will display the vitality of the former old industrial base for the second time."

2020,初级医生罢工：呼吁新的劳工行动,Junior doctors strike: Calls for fresh industrial action
2021,初级医生代表号召联盟批准其针对新合同纠纷采取新的劳工行动。,Representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract.
2022,英国医学协会初级医生委员会将要求其全体成员自九月初开始支持更多的劳工行动。,The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early September.
2023,初级医生委员会表示，部长们未解决对于合同的忧虑。,The JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract.
2024,初级医生与医科学生于7月份投票抵制与英国医学协会达成的合同交易。,Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BMA.
2025,参与投票的成员中，58%反对该合同交易。,It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the ballot.
2026,初级医生委员会主席 Ellen McCourt 在周四晚间于推特上发表的一封致成员信中表示，对于导致合同遭到抵制的问题，政府“一贯保持沉默”。,"In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, the JDC's chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained ""persistently silent"" on issues which, she said, had resulted in the contract being rejected."
2027,她表示：“鉴于此，初级医生委员会执行委员会已投票全盘驳回提议的新合同并呼吁就所有担忧重新进行正式协商。”,"She said: ""In light of this, the JDC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re-negotiations on all of your concerns."""
2028,针对政府的沉默态度，初级医生委员会执行委员会已于今日正式要求英国医学协会理事会召开特别会议批准旨在从九月初开始升级劳工行动的一项长期计划。,"In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September."
2029,该纠纷已导致初级医生今年共参与六次罢工，包括英国国家医疗服务体系历史上的首次全面罢工。,"The dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first all-out stoppages in the history of the NHS."
2030,英国医学协会初级医生领导者 Johann Malawana 博士在英国医学协会所推荐的合同议定条款遭到投票抵制之后辞职。,"The BMA's junior doctor leader, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract, which the BMA had recommended."
2031,"在54,000名初级医生与医科学生投票之前的会议中，他曾对英国医学协会成员表示，该交易不错，因此应该予以接受。","He had told BMA members the deal was a good one that should be accepted, during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students."
2032,投票后，卫生部长 Jeremy Hunt 表示，该合同将在英格兰医护人员中强制实施。,"Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in England."
2033,俄罗斯与土耳其：“格格不入联盟”？,Russia and Turkey: An 'alliance of misfits'?
2034,一个手势结束一场危机。,It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
2035,俄罗斯与土耳其领导人周二进行会见，双方握手并宣布正式结束长达八个月的口水战与经济制裁。,The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions.
2036,然而，当弗拉基米尔·普京在一座圣彼德斯堡宫殿金碧辉煌的大厅中迎接土耳其总统时，我有种强烈的感觉：此次和解是安卡拉最希望看到的。,"But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most."
2037,是的，双方确实握手了。,"There was the handshake, yes."
2038,然而，即使是按照普京先生一向内敛的标准来看，普京也只是浅浅微笑，几乎未流露出热情之意。,But Mr Putin's smile looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards.
2039,据报道，雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安则五次提到“好朋友”普京。,"Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his ""dear friend"" Mr Putin - five times, according to one report."
2040,我记不清了。,I lost count.
2041,同时，他承诺与俄罗斯的关系将回归至危机发生前的水平，甚至达到更高水平。,"He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but even higher."
2042,次日，此间一家报纸写到，埃尔多安先生则表现的好像什么都没发生一样。,The next day one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
2043,但是，我认为他的热情暗示了某些相反的东西。,"To me, his enthusiasm implied the opposite."
2044,然而，普京先生持续冷淡的态度说明他什么都没有忘记。,But a lingering coolness emanating from Mr Putin showed that Russia's leader has forgotten nothing.
2045,实际上，他在开场白中提到的第一件事便是此次危机的原因：土耳其于叙利亚边境击落一架俄罗斯战机。,"In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border."
2046,莫斯科当时的反应很激烈。,Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
2047,普京先生针对该事件进行猛烈抨击，指责安卡拉在背后暗算莫斯科。,"Mr Putin lashed out, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back."
2048,来自所谓朋友的攻击更让人难以接受。,"The offence was even greater, coming from a supposed friend."
2049,双方很难，甚至不可能重新建立真正的信任。,"Rebuilding real trust will be hard, perhaps impossible."
2050,自11月份开始，俄罗斯民意也有所扭转。,Russian public opinion has also turned since November.
2051,数月来，被政府控制的媒体对安卡拉进行了令人震惊的全力进攻。,"For months, state-controlled media conducted a staggering, all-out offensive against Ankara."
2052,突然之间，土耳其人似乎要为所有事情负责。,"All of a sudden, it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything."
2053,其中，最严重的是来自高级官员的指责：埃尔多安先生的家人从所谓伊斯兰国控制的叙利亚地区的非法石油交易中获利。,Most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdogan's own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
2054,他已断然否认该种说法。,He's denied that emphatically.
2055,然而，圣彼德斯堡传来的消息显示，是时候该向前看了。,But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it's time to move on.
2056,毕竟此次会面的前提是普京收到土耳其总统埃尔多安的道歉。,"After all, this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan."
2057,俄罗斯可以宣布胜利了。,Russia could claim a victory of sorts.
2058,对于安卡拉来说，休战的好处显而易见。,For Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear.
2059,首先，埃尔多安在上个月政变失败后险些被赶下台，因此他需要所有朋友的支持。,"First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup."
2060,不断的恐怖袭击显然已对他造成很大打击。,Repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
2061,同时也有经济动机。,There is also an economic motive.
2062,俄罗斯制裁对土耳其打击很大，尤其是禁止每年可输送几百万俄罗斯游客至土耳其海岸的包机服务。,"Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year."
2063,该数字已大幅下滑近90%。,The number has slumped by almost 90%.
2064,随着航班恢复，俄罗斯的旅行社与包机公司必将松一口气。,"As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume."
2065,他们将迎来季末地中海旅游潮。,They're banking on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
2066,国家电视台甚至在本周预测，一旦土耳其农产品进口重新放开，水果及蔬菜的价格将下降。,"And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again."
2067,莫斯科报纸 Vedemosti 的一篇报道称：“游客去了，番茄回来了。”,"""Tourists that way, tomatoes back here,"" as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it."
2068,对于莫斯科来说，此次访问也具有额外的政治价值。,But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
2069,安卡拉对于西方世界对接管意图的微弱反应感到愤怒。,Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover.
2070,此外，安卡拉对于加入欧盟谈判的缓慢进展及普京的插手长期感到不满，普京热衷于利用政治寒意以及削弱土耳其与西方世界的关系。,Add to that its long-standing grudge at the snail's pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at Turkey's ties with the West.
2071,由于在政变失败后拥护当选当局，俄罗斯领导人必将获得安卡拉的加分。,The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
2072,注意，这对于一直对政权更迭怀抱根深蒂固恐惧的莫斯科来说是一种馈赠。,"Mind you, that's a given for Moscow which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change."
2073,因此，在这个金碧辉煌的海边宫殿所举行的会面使俄罗斯与土耳其两个被西方世界拒绝与虐待的国家结成盟友，一位分析师将其描述为“格格不入联盟”。,"So the summit at this glitzy, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an ""alliance of misfits"": two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West, joining forces."
2074,然而，尽管公开和解，但双方仍存在重大分歧。,"Still, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have major differences."
2075,叙利亚是关键因素之一。莫斯科近日在叙利亚扮演和事佬的角色，而俄罗斯与土耳其却支持相反派别。,"The key one is Syria, where Moscow has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides."
2076,可以预见到的是，在经过近三个小时的初步谈话后，两位总统在发布会上表示，尚未谈及那个话题。,"It could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn't even touched on the topic."
2077,土耳其总统刻意回避关于双方分歧的问题，而普京则予以强调。,"Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them."
2078,双方就如何在叙利亚问题上求同存异未达成明确共识。,There is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria.
2079,在北大西洋公约组织成员国土耳其击落俄战机所带来的数月公开敌对及引发大型灾难的可能下，两国领导人再次重启对话肯定是件好事。,But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again.
2080,苏格兰皇家银行将不再为苏格兰以外客户服务,Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland
2081,据苏格兰皇家银行首席执行官透露，银行将简化为一个后勤部门。,"The brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive."
2082,苏格兰皇家银行将不再为苏格兰以外的客户服务。,Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
2083,罗斯·麦克尤恩告诉英国广播公司苏格兰分部，苏格兰皇家银行品牌曾经致力于其全球雄心壮志。,Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions.
2084,但八年前濒临倒闭，不得不接受救助从那时开始便放弃了那样的追求。,It has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out.
2085,那段时间，品牌策略师使用‘RBS’来保护其它消费金融品牌。,"During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands."
2086,集团曾耗费数百万英镑以赞助橄榄球六国赛和温布尔顿网球锦标赛冠军安迪·穆雷等方式赞助国际体育赛事。,"It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray."
2087,但是现在，正确的做法是让更多的国家品牌崭露头角。,"But now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore."
2088,苏格兰皇家银行将为苏格兰客户所用，但不会回复原样。,"Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be initialised."
2089,在英格兰和威尔士，所有在总部及证券交易所以外的提法将更改为国民西敏寺银行。,"In England and Wales, all RBS references, outside head office and the stock exchange listing, will be changed to NatWest."
2090,阿尔斯特银行品牌已用于爱尔兰共和国与北爱尔兰自治区的客户。,The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
2091,还有一些其它更突出的较小私人银行品牌，例如顾资银行、Adam &amp; Co、 Drummond 与 Holt's Military Bank。,"There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam &amp; Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank."
2092,麦克尤恩先生曾在因弗内斯郡客户与员工的参观之旅中接受采访。,Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
2093,他告诉英国广播公司苏格兰分部说：“苏格兰皇家银行品牌将最终成为我们的投资者品牌，同时也是员工受雇品牌之一，因为目前更大意义上我们已成为一个拥有众多品牌的银行。”,"He told BBC Scotland: ""The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands."""
2094,由于该银行本身成为一个国际品牌，RBS也成为全球品牌。,"As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand."
2095,目前，我要说的是，我们不再重点关注全球，我们已将目光转向本土。,"I'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations."
2096,每一个品牌代表着各自所在行业的不同，而我们的员工通过不同品牌为客户服务。,"Each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands."
2097,苏格兰皇家银行已表明不会继续赞助六国锦标赛；同时，已努力提升不同品牌在体育赛事赞助的形象。,"RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship."
2098,首席执行官表示：“现在到了成为一家多品牌银行的时候，因为私下我们一直在探求如何成为一家更好的服务于客户的银行。”,"""The time is right for us to move to the bank of brands, because underneath (we've been asking) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers?"" said the chief executive."
2099,如果三年前我们立志成为一家拥有众多品牌的大银行将备受嘲讽。,It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd said we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there.
2100,目前我们重点关注客户需求，并且我相信您已注意到了这些变化。,"But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change."
2101,我认为我们可以重新启动这些品牌，而且现在时间正合适。,"We can bring those brands back up again, so I think the time is right."

2110,我对自己在纽马基特取得的成绩感到高兴，因为30年前我就是从这里起步的。,I'm very pleased for it to have happened at Newmarket because this is where I landed 30 years ago.
2111,"这不是一场大规模的赛马会，也不是英国皇家爱斯科赛马会 (Royal Ascot)，这只是一个有着20,000名观众的普通的周五晚上。","It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people."
2112,我很欣慰，也很谦恭。,I'm relieved and very humble.
2113,戴图理在获胜后牵来了 Predilection，引起了全场欢呼,Dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in Predilection after victory
2114,"在障碍赛领域，有两名骑师取得了这一成就，他们分别是冠军骑师理查德·约翰逊 (Richard Johnson) 和现已退役的20届冠军麦考伊 (Anthony McCoy) 爵士，其中麦考伊爵士在其破纪录的职业生涯中取得了超过4,300场胜利。","Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career."
2115,"柏葛是九届德比赛冠军，在其职业生涯中共取得了4,493场胜利","Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins"
2116,戴图理是当代最棒的骑师之一，所以他取得这一里程碑式成就也就不足为奇了，在他之前取得这一成就的人不多。,Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him.
2117,他时尚而健硕，但是真正让他在称重室中脱颖而出的却是他在战术上的理性。,"He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room."
2118,他是一位了不起的马术大使，多年来，他的热情和魅力为这项运动吸引了大量粉丝。,"He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years."
2119,"几周前，我在 Epsom 跟戴图理说，如果他不仅仅是一个周末与大赛骑师，他应该已经能取得6,000场胜利了！","I said to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he'd have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey!"
2120,说真的，戴图理堪称英国三十年来最好的马术获胜者，这一点太重要了。,"Seriously though, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to see."
2121,他性格活泼，这对英国赛马来说是好事，但是除此之外，他还是一位不可思议的骑师。,"He's a lively character which is good for British racing but more than that, he's an incredible jockey."
2122,戴图理以其标志性的跳跃下马动作庆祝这一里程碑,Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying dismount
2123,从跳跃冲线到跳跃下马，二十年来，戴图理一直是英国平地赛领域的典型代表。,"From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of British Flat racing for two decades."
2124,他的职业生涯如过山车一般。,It has been a rollercoaster ride.
2125,他获得了多场大赛的冠军，其中包括1996年在英国皇家爱斯科赛马会取得的著名的“七连胜”，但是，他也遭遇了坠机事件，还因服用禁药遭到禁赛。,"Stacks of big-race winners, including his famous 1996 'Magnificent Seven' at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban."
2126,三年前，当他在六个月禁期结束后重回赛场时，曾一度很吃力。但是，他表现出了惊人的性格优势，并终于重回巅峰，给那些持怀疑态度的人当头一棒。,"Three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-month suspension, but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best."
2127,他或许做不了太长时间了——戴图理之前曾说过，他希望至少能参赛到50岁前。,"And he may not be done for some time - Dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50, at least."
2128,俄罗斯总统普京解除谢尔盖·伊万诺夫办公厅主任职务,Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
2129,俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京 (Vladimir Putin) 出乎意料地解除了谢尔盖·伊万诺夫 (Sergei Ivanov) 的总统办公厅主任职务。,Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
2130,多年来，伊万诺夫先生一直是深得普京先生信任的核心集团的一分子。,Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
2131,现年63岁的伊万诺夫如今已被任命为环境与交通问题特别代表。,The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues.
2132,克里姆林宫的一份声明称，普京先生已“宣布解除伊万诺夫的俄罗斯总统办公厅主任一职，”但是没有给出原因。,"A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr Putin had ""decreed to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration,"" but gave no reason."
2133,2012年开始担任伊万诺夫先生副手的安东·瓦伊诺 (Anton Vaino) 已获任命为他的接任者。,"Mr Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor."
2134,瓦伊诺先生现年44岁，是一名前外交官。,"Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."
2135,他1972年出生在爱沙尼亚首都塔林，毕业于著名的莫斯科国立国际关系学院 (MGIMO)，在东京大使馆工作过。,"Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy."
2136,后来，他管理总统草案和政府员工，克里姆林宫网站（使用俄语）如是说。,"Later he managed presidential protocol and government staff, the Kremlin website says (in Russian)."
2137,获任命后，他对普京先生说：“谢谢您的信任。”,"On being appointed, he told Mr Putin: ""Thank you for your trust."""
2138,我认为本政府最重要的任务就是支持国家元首起草法律和控制指令实施。,I think the administration's most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented.
2139,普京先生周五告诉俄罗斯电视台说，伊万诺夫先生自己要求辞职并推荐了瓦伊诺先生来接任自己。,"Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him."
2140,这样的笑容令人信服吗？,Do the smiles convince?
2141,莫斯科对此举感到不解。,This is a move that has mystified Moscow.
2142,长期以来，谢尔盖·伊万诺夫一直是普京最亲密的助手之一，跟普京一样，也在苏联安全局（克格勃）工作过。,"Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB."
2143,作为办公厅主任，他曾是该国最具影响力的人士之一。,As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
2144,在国家电视台播出的一次与普京总统的会面上，两人均称是这位办公厅主任自己要求辞职的。,In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request.
2145,尽管在镜头前满面笑容，可是几乎没人信服——特别是在议会选举之前的这个时候。,"But despite the smiles for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before parliamentary elections."
2146,所以，这是在某种权力争夺中落败导致的吗？,So is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle?
2147,尚无从得知。,No-one knows yet.
2148,但是，官方说法——一个曾被视为总统候选人的人选突然间选择执掌俄罗斯的环境政策——引来了众多怀疑。,"But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism."
2149,"克里姆林宫网站上引述了伊万诺夫先生与普京先生的对话，他说：""是的，2012年初，我曾在一次对话中请求你予以我这个难做的职位，甚至可以说是麻烦的职位，四年的任期。""","In remarks to Mr Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said ""it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years."
2150,"""结果是，我已担任总统办公厅主任四年八个月啦。""","Well, it turns out that I've been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months."
2151,伊万诺夫先生于2011年12月担任此职。,Mr Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
2152,在此之前，他担任副总理和国防部长。,He served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister.
2153,他是俄罗斯安全委员会的一员，还跟普京先生一样，也是国家安全局前成员。,"He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service, like Mr Putin."
2154,20世纪90年代末，当普京先生出任联邦安全局（FSB，前身为国家安全局）局长时，伊万诺夫先生被任命为他的副手。,"In the late 1990s, when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr Ivanov was appointed as his deputy."
2155,普京先生上台后，他又指定伊万诺夫先生为他最信任的五人之一。,"When Mr Putin came to power, he named Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most."
2156,外界曾一度认为伊万诺夫先生可能会在普京先生第二任期结束后出任俄罗斯总统，因为三连任是违反宪法的。,"It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's second term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional."
2157,但是这一职位最终归属于普京的另一位亲密助手德米特里·梅德韦杰夫 (Dmitry Medvedev)。,"But that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev."
2158,在三年半后重新任职总统之前，普京先生担任俄罗斯总理一职。,"Mr Putin became prime minister, before returning to the presidency just three-and-a-half years later."

2160,Banff 的一位居民发现有鱼惊现自家花园，随后发出了求助。,A Banff man has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in Banff.
2161,Kevin Bain 认为这75条鱼可能是被海上龙卷风刮来的沙鳗。,Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels deposited by a waterspout.
2162,Bain 先生居住在距离大海约500米的地方，他在 Periscope 上发布了这一奇怪场景的视频，希望有人能为他解释为何会出现这些两英寸长的鱼。,"Mr Bain, who lives about 500m from the sea, posted footage of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope someone could shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish."
2163,昆斯费里大桥现已通至法夫,Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
2164,该斥资13.5亿英镑的项目计划于2017年5月完工,The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017
2165,工程师们已经把昆斯费里大桥 (Queensferry Crossing) 的北桥面和高架桥连接到一起，也就是说大桥如今已通至法夫。,Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
2166,位于每座大桥三个桥头堡附近的四处“桥面风机”合龙现已接近竣工，而该项目为首个合龙的大桥。,"It is the first of four closures between the ""deck fans,"" which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers."
2167,"起始于法夫的这段大桥长600米，重30,000公吨。","The bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes."
2168,"它使用了10,000公吨钢材、20,000公吨混凝土和46根斜拉索。","It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay-cables."
2169,该斥资13.5亿英镑的项目计划于2017年5月完工。,The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017.
2170,经济部长基思·布朗 (Keith Brown) 今天参观了现场，成为首批登上大桥的人之一。,Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge.
2171,"他说：""这是昆斯费里大桥建造过程中的一个历史性时刻。""","He said: ""This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queensferry Crossing."
2172,"我们都见证了在如此宏大项目上的工程作业，光是建造该大桥的这一段就使用了超过30,000公吨混凝土和钢材。","We're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge."
2173,尽管该桥的规模和重量都很巨大，但是完成高架桥和桥面之间的合龙却需要精细作业，需要非常精准的装配。,Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up.
2174,总的来说，近79%的总桥面现已安装完成，最后一段桥面的混凝土桥面今天在 Rosyth 浇注，也就是说所有桥面都已做好就位准备。,"Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now in place, the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today, meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge."
2175,"昆斯费里大桥建造公司项目总监 Michael Martin 说：""不管是哪个大桥项目，第一次合龙都是一个重大里程碑。""","Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project director said: ""The first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone."
2176,就该了不起的项目而言，此次合龙展现出前沿的土木工程技术。,"On this fantastic project, this closure represents leading edge civil engineering."
2177,安装最后一段路面板并将之连接至扩大的北桥堡路面板之后，接下来需要完成北侧或者接近陆地一侧的剩余缺口合龙。,"After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or landward - side."
2178,完成该项作业需把北部高架引桥南移700毫米。,This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.
2179,这是一次规模巨大的作业，同时也是一次非常精密的作业。,"This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation."
2180,"说它规模巨大，是因为高架桥长222米，重约6,000公吨，需要拉出一个约3%的斜度。","Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3%."
2181,说它精密，是因为工程团队需要确保偏差非常之小，每边只有几毫米。,Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way.
2182,令人欣慰的是，一切都进展得很顺利。,"Happily, it all went very well."
2183,西蒙·拜尔斯摘得女子体操全能冠军,Simone Biles nails all-around gold in women's gymnastics
2184,忘掉压力。,Forget the pressure.
2185,忘掉炒作。,Forget the hype.
2186,西蒙·拜尔斯 (Simone Biles) 不受这一切的影响。,Simone Biles is immune to all of it.
2187,跳马时充满活力。,Dynamic on vault.
2188,平衡木上游刃有余。,Effortless on beam.
2189,自由体操动作惊艳。,Jaw-dropping on floor.
2190,整体表现非常精彩。,Brilliant all over.
2191,现在，终于成为了奥运冠军。,"And now, finally, an Olympic champion."
2192,这位19岁的美国体操运动员周四摘得了全能冠军，充分在奥运赛场上展示了她在体操方面领先世界的天赋。,"The 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the all-around title on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spotlight."
2193,她以62.198的总分远超银牌得主、“终极五人组”(Final Five) 队员莱斯曼 (Aly Raisman) 和铜牌得主俄罗斯选手穆斯塔芬娜 (Aliya Mustafina)。,"Her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and ""Final Five"" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina."
2194,来自美国的西蒙-拜尔斯于周四在巴西里约热内卢举的2016年夏季奥运会的艺术体操女子个人全能决赛上进行了平衡木表演。,"United States' Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday."
2195,拜尔斯帮助美国队在奥运会女子体操个人全能上实现了四连冠，她个人在本届奥运会上共夺得五枚奖牌，进一步印证了她是这一代，也可能是有史以来，最优秀的体操队员。,Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
2196,当看到自己总分的那一刻，拜尔斯忍不住流下泪水。她终于结束了这一漫长的旅程。,She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended.
2197,拜尔斯因此跻身像迈克尔-菲尔普斯 (Michael Phelps) 一样的“几十年一遇运动员”的行列，他们将各自领域的体育项目提升到新高度：,The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:
2198,拜尔斯最近三年一直称霸赛场，共夺得15枚世界锦标赛奖牌，其中包括十枚金牌。怀揣志向的她每日刻苦训练，以达到更高的精确度。1984年奥运冠军玛莉·卢·雷顿 (Mary Lou Retton) 称：“拜尔斯是我见过的最棒的体操运动员。”,"Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her ""the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."""
2199,在巴西还有最后一场比赛，但这场比赛与其说是拜尔斯与其他体操选手的竞争，不如说是她自己与巨大期望压力之间的较量。,"One last test awaited in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations."
2200,如果拜尔斯没有满载金牌回到她位于德克萨斯州斯普林的家，大家一定会非常失望。,"Anything less than heading back to her family's home in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment."
2201,来自美国的西蒙·拜尔斯（左）与莱斯曼相互拥抱，她们在8月份（周四）巴西里约热内卢举办的2016年夏季奥运会的艺术体操女子个人全能决赛上分别获得金牌与银牌。,"United States' Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug."
2202,拜尔斯于周二斩获第一枚金牌，给即将退役的国家队教练卡罗利 (Martha Karolyi) 的欢送会奉上一份惊喜的厚礼。,Biles earned the first one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's going away party.
2203,尽管拜尔斯坚称自己在常年占据冠军宝座的过程中并没有计划未来，但事实不完全是这样的。,"While Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true."
2204,拜尔斯自由体操当中的一段——包括她标志性的翻腾串连的那一段，配的是拉丁音乐，而这段音乐正是她在与里约奥运会场馆仅有一街之隔住所里常听的。,A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
2205,这绝非巧合。,It's not a coincidence.
2206,这个在婴儿时期被祖父母收养，并在一次体育馆实地考察旅行时被教练艾米·伯尔曼 (Aimee Boorman) 的母亲发现的女孩现已成长为中坚力量。,The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force.
2207,自从2013年夏季以来，拜尔斯就没有在全能比赛中失手过，只要想赢，她就一定会赢。,"She hasn't lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to."
2208,穆斯塔芬娜两次旋转后的稍稍领先只是一个幻觉。,"Though Mustafina took a small lead through two rotations, it was a mirage."
2209,平衡木与自由体操两个项目的卫冕世界冠军拜尔斯埋伏以待。,Balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait.
2210,她的平衡木得分15.433，自由体操得分15.933。,She went back in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor.
2211,在等待最后比分出来的时候，莱斯曼轻轻抱了一下拜尔斯。当拜尔斯得知自己取得梦寐以求的成绩后，顿时留下了眼泪。,"Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality."
2212,莱斯曼的表现有点像是对四年前的复仇，当时她并列第三，但在决胜局中输给了穆斯塔芬娜。,"Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker."
2213,但这一次，这位被美国人戏称为“奶奶”的22岁队长遥遥领先。,"This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call ""grandma"" was well ahead."
2214,她在自由体操结束后向人群飞吻，宣告回归，但这样的回归以前有时却看起来存在疑问。,"She blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise, overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt."
2215,拜尔斯才19岁。从本周早些时候起，其消息就在推特上病毒般传播开来。就拜尔斯而言，其人生已被赋予了全新意义。,"As for Biles, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning:"
2216,“身中数弹”的6岁 Mahaj Brown 在费城枪击案中幸免,"Mahaj Brown, 6, ""riddled with bullets,"" survives Philadelphia shooting"
2217,警方称，一名六岁的男孩在费城遭到枪击，这也是本周该市第二个中枪的六岁儿童。,"Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week."
2218,孩子的祖父母向 CBS Philadelphia 证实，遭枪击的孩子是 Mahaj Brown。,The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
2219,他们说，Brown 的腹股沟、腿、胳膊和腹部等部位有多处枪伤，但是孩子在送医途中是清醒的。,"The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital."
2220,“他遭了不少罪，小小的身体被子弹打得千疮百孔，”他的祖母 Delores Melendez 对电视台说。,"""He just took a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets,"" his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station."
2221,我简直不敢相信。,I just can't believe it.
2222,这名男孩在医院的情况很危急，已经接受了多次手术。,The boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
2223,他的家人告诉电视台说，孩子有望康复。,Family tells the station he is expected to recover.
2224,他原本要开始在当地一所小学读一年级了。,He was set to start first grade at a local elementary school.
2225,Brown 是 Germantown 地区遭到枪击的四人之一。,Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section.
2226,其他遭到枪击的三人中，两人29岁，一人32岁。,Also shot were three men: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year old.
2227,据 CBS Philadelphia 称，其中一名29岁的受害者情况危急；另两名受害者情况稳定。,"One of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition; the other two victims were listed in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia."
2228,电视台称，这名孩子与那名29岁的情况危急的受害者是在汽车前座上被发现的。,"The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports."
2229,另两名受害者不在车上，警方正在调查是否受伤人员中就有枪手。,The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.
2230,调查人员告诉 CBS Philadelphia，看起来像是多名枪手交火。,Investigators tells CBS Philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen.
2231,现场发现了不少攻击性武器的弹壳，由此可推断他们使用的是不同的攻击性武器。,"Assault weapon-style shell casings, traced to different assault style weapons, littered the scene."
2232,由此判断，这无疑是一场持续战。,It appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle.
2233,街道两边的人行道上都有弹壳。,"There were casings in the street, on both sides of the sidewalk."
2234,“所以，由此可见当时现场有多名武装人员处于激战状态，”费城警察局长Anthony Ginaldi 对电视台说。,"So it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged,"" Philadelphia police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station."
2235,该地区有不少房屋及车辆受损。,Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck.
2236,尚未实行抓捕行动，据说，警察在调看监控录像。,No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.
2237,周二，还有一名六岁儿童（女孩），在位于 West Oak Lane 社区的家门口玩耍时，被流弹射中胳膊。,"Another 6-year-old, a girl, was hit in her arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood."
2238,她目前正在康复，警察仍在追捕嫌犯。,"She is recovering, and police are still searching for a suspect."
2239,为何我们需要西蒙、加布丽埃勒和劳瑞,"Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"
2240,我就是这样评价今年的女子奥运体操队的，原因不止一个。,That's what I call this year's Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team and for more reasons than one.
2241,首先，从1984年起，我去了每一届夏季奥运会，但美国从未这般占据霸主地位。,"First, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant."
2242,其次，这支体操队有三名优秀的体操运动员——西蒙·拜尔斯 (Simone Biles)、加布丽埃勒·道格拉斯 (Gabby Douglas) 和劳瑞·埃尔南德斯 (Lauren Laurie Hernandez)，她们一直激励着众多有色人种女孩。,"And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren ""Laurie"" Hernandez, who have been inspiring so many young girls of color."
2243,这支队伍的组成令所有人都倍感自豪，因为里面包含了犹太教的阿里·莱斯曼 (Aly Raisman) 和天主教的麦迪逊·科希安 (Madison Kocian)。,"The make-up of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is making everyone proud."
2244,这支队伍终于看起像美国队了。,"This team looks, finally, like America."
2245,它还巩固了黑人及拉丁裔女性在这项运动中的巅峰地位。,It also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport.
2246,过去四年里，首屈一指的女体操运动员一直是非裔美国人。,"For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African-American."
2247,去年，西蒙和加布丽埃勒分列第一、第二位。,"Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2."
2248,这太厉害了。,This is powerful.
2249,上届奥运会，加布丽埃勒·道格拉斯“出人意料”地成为了奥运冠军，这令美国欢呼不已。,"Last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered."
2250,如今，全世界都能见证三届世界冠军西蒙·拜尔斯、道格拉斯和劳瑞·埃尔南德斯精彩绝伦的表现。他们把常规的体操技巧演绎得出神入化。,"Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, yet masterful gymnastics routines."
2251,周四，西蒙帮助美国队在女子个人全能项目上实现四连冠。,"On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women's individual all-around event."
2252,她的队友阿里·莱斯曼斩获了银牌。,And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.
2253,我们登上了这项运动的巅峰，但在全美体操教学课堂上却并非如此。,"We are witnessing the top of the sport, but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country."
2254,西蒙、加布丽埃勒和劳瑞进入奥运代表队的途径跟阿里及麦迪逊一样。,"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team."
2255,她们是“终极五人组”(Final Five)，因为下届奥运体操队将由四名体操运动员组成，这是 Marta Karolyi 最后一年执教。,"They are the ""Final Five"" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year coaching."
2256,但是现实却是，体操是一项费用昂贵的运动，体操运动员主要在私人体操俱乐部进行训练，她们的父母需要支付训练、设施、差旅、服装、比赛及旅馆费用（包括教练及体操运动员和家人的相关费用），并且费用清单还在不断增加。,"But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on."
2257,大部分的体操俱乐部坐落在可为该项产业提供支持的富裕的郊区。,Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business.
2258,体操运动员的所有训练都在这些俱乐部完成，对体操运动员的家庭而言是一笔长期的昂贵开支。,"These clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training, and it's a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families."
2259,拜尔斯的教练艾米·伯尔曼 (Aimee Boorman) 和埃尔南德斯的教练 Maggie Haney 自这两名体操运动员开始练体操起一直执教她们。,"Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics."
2260,我们必须将更实惠、更可及的体操训练带给无数深受西蒙、加布丽埃勒和劳瑞影响的年轻女孩。,"We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie."
2261,20年前，我成立了自己的体操基金会。,I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
2262,"在我的组织中，我们在黑人住宅区向15,000余名城市青年（主要是黑人和西班牙裔美国人）提供免费、廉价的体操，并培养出全国乃至世界冠军。","At my organizations, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics, based in Harlem, for over 15,000 urban youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions."
2263,9月份，我们将扩大到底特律（我的家乡），向那些值得获得这一学习机会并将从这项了不起的奥运运动中受益的年轻人提供高品质体操。,"In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport."
2264,体操有助于培养身体的力量、灵活性及协调性，还有助于培养吃苦耐劳的精神、自律性及决心。,"Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."
2265,这些可为一个人的健康、学业及工作成功带来终身益处。,"This combination provides life-long benefits for good health, success in school and work."
2266,受这支队伍的鼓舞，成千上万名年轻女孩将学习体操，这真的很棒。,It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great.
2267,参加运动意义重大，对女孩来说尤其如此。,"To participate in sport is so important, especially for girls."
2268,这是一个激动人心的时刻。,This is such an exciting time.
2269,感谢西蒙、阿里、劳瑞、加布丽埃勒及麦迪逊在赢得奥运团体金牌过程中所精彩展现出来的“女孩力量”，也感谢她们激励如此多背景各异的年轻女孩开启通向健康、强大、成功之路。,"Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of ""Girl Power"" in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy, strong and successful young women."
2270,驳回杰里米·亨特提议后，初级医生计划发起进一步罢工,Junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
2271,"部长们起初希望通过接受英国医学协会 (BMA) 官员修改后的合同来结束这场由变化引发的纠纷，但是37,000名参与投票的初级医生中，有58%反对该合同。","Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it."
2272,7月，亨特先生透露计划强制实行合同，他说英国国家医疗服务体系 (NHS) 目前处于“真空地带”，稍有延误便会损害员工和患者的利益。,"In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in ""no man's land"" and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients."
2273,新合同首先提到修改初级医生通宵与周末工作惯例，以改善非正常工作时间的护理情况。,"The first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract, which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours."
2274,昨天晚上，BMA 初级医生委员会主席 Ellen McCourt 博士在一份声明中说道：“初级医生对拟议的合同仍有着严重担忧，尤其担心它会加剧当前的劳动力危机，也未能公平地对待所有医生。”,"Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's junior doctors"" committee chair, said in a statement last night: ""Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly."""
2275,距离首批医生签署新合同仅剩八周时间了，我们需要取得进展，时间不多了。,"With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out."
2276,BMA 努力通过谈判解决纠纷，但是大家却不愿意参与，有时政府则以沉默应对。,"Efforts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and, at times, deafening silence from the government."
2277,尽管如此，就在上个月我们还是得到了杰里米·亨特的承诺，他说自己的大门始终敞开。,This is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open.
2278,“杰里米·亨特现在需要采取行动了，取消强制执行，解决初级医生”担心的问题。,"""Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the imposition and address junior doctors"" concerns."
2279,如果他不这样做，初级医生明确表示他们已经准备好采取进一步的劳工行动了。,If he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action.
2280,"上次罢工发生在4月底，导致近13,000台常规手术和100,000例预约延期，因为护士和会诊医生为纠察线上的医生打掩护。","The last strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line."
2281,部长们起初希望通过接受 BMA 修改后的合同来结束这场由变化引发的纠纷。,Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials.
2282,"BMA 希望为合同所涉及的54,000名初级医生争取更好的周末工资。","The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract."
2283,NHS Employers 首席执行官 Daniel Mortimer 呼吁初级医生不要再上演任何罢工了。,"Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes."
2284,Mortimer 先生说：“劳工行动收效甚微，相反却会对已然倾注全力的队伍和服务造成压力，导致患者、护理人员及其家人的担心、忧虑及混乱。”,"Mr Mortimer said: ""Industrial action achieves little or nothing, but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry, distress and disruption for patients, carers and their families."""
2285,过去两个月里，我们不断与初级医生委员会进行谈判，并和卫生部及其他部门一起积极回应他们对监护人角色和举报揭发的担忧。,"Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing."
2286,雇主们希望继续积极探讨其他重要话题——如部署、培训的灵活性、针对那些在职业生涯中断后重上岗之人的其他培训、培训成本、对课程提纲的共同认知、进修假和医疗领域的性别工资差异，这些说明了雇主、英格兰健康教育组织 (Health Education England) 和卫生部对11月、2月及5月与 BMA 达成的协议很重视。,"Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, costs of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May."
2287,每天2英镑的药物可降低心脏病发作威胁,The £2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat
2288,相关官员建议将一种每天2英镑的药物推广给更多患者并且要延长服药时间，之后数以千计的心脏病患者将从这种药物中受益。,"Thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £2-a-day drug, after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer."
2289,抗凝血药替卡格雷 (ticagrelor) 可降低心脏病患者的心脏病复发风险。,Anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease.
2290,这种药物在心脏病发作后持续服用12个月，可降低中风或心脏病再次发作的风险。,"The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack."
2291,英国国家医疗服务体系 (NHS) 下属监管机构国家卫生与临床优化研究所 (NICE) 建议患者持续服药四年，以便进一步降低心脏血管疾病的风险。,"NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems."
2292,但是现在，NHS 监管机构 NICE 建议给患者持续服药四年，以便进一步降低心脏血管疾病的风险。,"But now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems."
2293,"在英格兰，每年有大约140,000人罹患心脏病，其中有四分之一会继续遭遇心脏病复发或出现中风。","Some 140,000 people have a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke."
2294,心脏病发作和中风是脂肪物质在动脉壁沉积形成斑块导致的。,Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque.
2295,如果斑块断开，就会导致血栓，进而阻碍血流入心脏，导致心脏病发作。,"If the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack."
2296,如果血栓移动，就会进入血流，阻碍血流入大脑，导致中风。,"And if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke."
2297,已经经历过一次心脏病发作的患者，心脏病再次发作的风险更高。,People who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another.
2298,替卡格雷由英国公司阿斯利康 (AstraZeneca) 制造，以倍林达 (Brilique) 为商品名进行销售，可通过减少血栓的形成来降低发病风险。,"Ticagrelor, which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely."
2299,今日发布的 NICE 指导草案建议患者服用90 mg 的替卡格雷12个月时间，之后的三年每天服用60mg替卡格雷和两次阿斯匹林。,"The draft NICE guidance, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years."
2300,NICE 卫生技术评估中心主任 Carole Longson 教授说：“尽管有有效的二级预防治疗，但是有多达四分之一有过心脏病发作史的患者会再次发病或中风，通常会造成严重后果。”,"Professor Carole Longson, director at the NICE health technology evaluation centre, said: ""Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."""
2301,对复发的恐惧会对一个人的生活品质造成很大的负面影响。,Fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
2302,证据表明，替卡格雷与阿司匹林一起服用可有效降低那些经历过心脏病发作之患者心脏病复发及中风的风险。,"The evidence shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack."
2303,替卡格雷的临时推荐将为成千上万受益的人们提供更多的治疗选择，对此我们深感欣慰。,In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it.
2304,由于有关替卡格雷在三年后的疗效及安全，特别是出血风险的信息很有限，该指导草案并不建议在这一期限之后继续用其治疗。,"Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period."
2305,电脑文化使“选举舞弊”盛行穆斯林地区,PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish

2309,这位原社区事务大臣、现任反贪一把手表示，拿宗教立场恫吓选民的做法影响恶劣，警方应被获准在投票站外设立警戒线，以此来保护心惊胆战的选民。,"The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters."

2316,这份报告是在东伦敦发生 Tower Hamlets 选举丑闻后，唐宁街要求发布的。,The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.
2317,去年，一家特别选举法庭裁定在任市长拉赫曼存在一连串的腐败和违法行为，应遭到革职。,"Last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices."
2318,该法庭发现，拉赫曼“非常可笑地滥用”穆斯林社区的宗教情感，并对剑指他种族歧视和伊斯兰恐惧症的指控闭口不谈。,"The court found Rahman ""cynically perverted"" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia."
2319,据说，拉赫曼“在竞选时宣称给他投票是忠诚穆斯林教徒的宗教义务。”,"Rahman, it was said, ""ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."""
2320,多达300张选票存在疑点，可能是选民假冒他人投票的。,"Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation, where a person votes while posing as someone else."

2323,埃里克爵士（照片中）就清理投票机制给出了多条建议，其中就包括带好身份证件，以证实自己的身份,"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are"
2324,他在报告中说：“证据表明，资深成员，特别是巴基斯坦和孟加拉国背景社区中的资深成员向一些少数族裔社区的弱势群体，尤其是妇女和年轻人，施加压力，让他们按照自己的意愿投票。”,"His report says: ""Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background."
2325,“由于对种族划分和宗教‘政治正确性’过度敏感，他们担心国家机构会对这样的行为视而不见。”,"""There were concerns that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of ""politically correct"" over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."""
2326,埃里克爵士提出了50条清理选举机制的建议，包括严禁政治活动家处理邮寄投票文件以阻止“投票收获”。,"Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop ""vote harvesting."""
2327,该报告还要求严查登记信息以防止选民名册被用于移民和福利诈骗。特雷莎·梅 (Theresa May) 也在考虑这份报告。,"The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud."

2339,“拉赫曼及其选举干事存在不少腐败及违法行为，因此遭到了选举法庭的撤销资格处分，”他说。,"""The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices,"" he said."
2340,依照刑事证明标准，他在很多方面无可置疑是有罪的。,He was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds.

2342,埃里克爵士说：“去年法庭对 Tower Hamlets 判决给大家敲响了警钟。”,"Sir Eric said: ""Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call."

2419,接着，用前臂和肩膀夹住枪，然后用你的肘部击打袭击者面部。,You then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.
2420,接下来用膝盖顶其腹股沟，当袭击者因疼痛而弯下身子时，扭转他手中的枪，用枪管和后备枪组打他的脸，保持武器一直对准他。,"A knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker doubles up in pain, you twist the gun from his hands, smack him in the face with the barrel and back up, keeping the weapon trained on him."
2421,如果枪手从前面靠近，也采用类似技巧——让你的身体不在火线范围内，夺取枪并扭转枪口，以便枪手不能开火。,"For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire."
2422,与此同时，将重量压在枪上并击打袭击者的胸部，并从他紧握的手中扭转枪口，然后将枪口对准他。,"At the same time, put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him."
2423,听起来很复杂？,Sounds tricky?

2490,法国法院驳回拆除丛林难民营中商店的请愿书,French court rejects bid to demolish shops at Jungle refugee camp
2491,法国一家法院驳回了加莱政府意在拆除“丛林”难民营中几十家临时搭建的商店及餐馆的请愿书。该难民营中目前居住着上千名难民。,A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living.
2492,在该法院本周的听证会上，加莱政府辩称法国政府应有权拆除该难民营内总计72间临时搭建的商店。民众在难民营中的这些商店里销售从香烟到能量饮料在内的商品、提供理发服务，还在临时搭建的餐馆中以50美分（40便士）的价格卖茶或以几欧元的价格售卖基本餐点。,"At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants."
2493,加莱省长办公室认为这些地方应被拆除，因为它们是不缴税的平行经济，还存在火灾和卫生隐患。,"The Calais prefect's office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax, and because they carried fire and sanitation risks."
2494,人道主义团体却对法院表示这些商店和餐馆极为重要，因为国家支持的协会及其他团体所提供的免费食物根本无法满足该难民营不断增长的难民的需求。,"Humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp."
2495,他们称，这些临时搭建的商店和餐馆经常为有需要之人提供庇护所及免费食物。,They argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need.
2496,里尔一家法院裁定，没有法律依据来驱逐这72间临时商店的经营者，但表示加莱省长的担忧“完全可以理解”。,"A Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns ""were totally understandable."""
2497,Jean·François Molla 法官表示，这些杂货店、咖啡馆及餐馆的作用远不止简单地向那些“生活在极其危险条件下”的难民提供食物。,"The judge, Jean-François Molla, said the groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that ""live in extremely precarious conditions."""
2498,他说，这些地方是难民和志愿者之间平静的汇合点。,He said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
2499,其中一个遭到拆除威胁的地方就是该难民营的“Jungle Book Kids”咖啡馆，该非营利性小店每天提供200份食物、英语及法语课，还为该难民营中数百名无人陪伴的弱势未成年人提供庇护建议。,"One of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids"" Cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp."
2500,170000多人签署了请愿书来保护这间咖啡馆。,"More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids"" cafe."
2501,一封给《卫报》(Guardian) 的信中写道，关闭这间咖啡馆“将是这些儿童（很多儿童只有八岁）的一场大灾难。”,"A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure ""would be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom are as young as eight."""
2502,Help Refugees 和 L'Auberge des Migrants 这两家慈善组织周五预计，丛林难民营中的难民数量已突破9000，这也是继夏季难民人数激增以来的最高水平。,"Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer."

2509,她感激地说：“我原以为爸爸去世了，我和哥哥都上不成大学了，没想到县里及时为我们解决了困难。”,"""I thought my elder brother and I cannot afford the college study after my father passed away. It never occurred to me before the county government helped us so timely."" She said gratefully."

2519,"相关部门负责人称,从“暂住证”到“居住证”的转变,意味着北京对非京籍常住人口将从“管理”转为多方位服务。","A responsible person of the relevant department said that the transition from the ""temporary residence permit"" to ""residence permit"" means that Beijing will shift its administration for non-permanent residents from the ""management"" to multi-directional services."

2527,因此，高污染、大能源、多占地的问题还没有从生产生活方式转变上得到根本性应对。,"Therefore, the problem of high pollution, heavy energy consumption and land occupation has not been fundamentally addressed in the transformation of production and life styles."
2528,一方面，从江苏省各级各类生态环境创建成效来看，以绝对优势位居全国首位；但另一方面，资源环境承载压力大。,"On the one hand, Jiangsu tops in the whole country from the perspective of the establishment achievement of ecological environment of all levels and classes. But on the other hand, the resource and environment pressure is heavy."

2550,"2016年1月1日前已取得环评的现有排污单位,暂不征收有偿使用费。","On January 1, 2016, the current pollutant discharging unit which obtained environmental impact assessment shall be exempt from expenditure of compensated use."
2551,"“有偿获得排污权并不等于获得了违法排污的权力,并不能随意地排放污染物。”","The obtaining of compensated emission right is not equal to the obtaining of illegal discharge, so companies cannot discharge pollutants at will."
2552,"青岛市环保局副局长汉红燕介绍,如果违法排污、超标排污仍然要按照相关的法规予以处罚,不可能允许违法企业通过购买排污权的方式来规避处罚。","Han Hongyan, deputy director of Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau, introduces that companies of illegal and excessive sewage must be punished in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations.

2555,"有了经济利益的驱动,减少污染物的排放就从政府的强制行为变为企业自觉的市场行为,从而真正达到保护环境、保护自然、保障公众健康的目的。","With the economic interests drive, to reduce pollutants' discharge has shifted from the government's mandatory behavior into a conscious market behavior, so as to truly protect the environment, nature and public health."
2556,"排污权又称“排放权”,是排放污染物的权利,指排放者在政府分配的额度内,依法享有的向环境排放污染物的权利。","Emission right, also known as ""dumping right"", means the right to discharge pollutants. It refers to the right for emitters to discharge pollutants to the environment in line with the law within the quota assigned by the government."
2557,这种权利实质上是排污者对环境容量资源占有、使用和收益的权利。,"This right is essentially the right of the emitters to occupy, use and benefit from environmental capacity resources."
2558,"下一步,在污染物排放总量不超过允许排放量的前提下,内部各污染源之间通过货币交换的方式相互调剂排污量。","Next, under the premise that the total discharge of pollutants does not exceed the total allowable emission volume, the internal resources of pollution began to swap discharge capacities via currency exchange."

2563,根据协议，停火不包括对“伊斯兰国”“支持阵线”等联合国安理会认定的恐怖组织的军事打击。,"Under the agreement, the ceasefire does not include a military strike against terrorist organizations including ""Islamic State"" and ""Salvation Front "", which were identified by the United Nation Security Council."
2564,俄将在该基地继续建设相关军事基础设施，俄军人的生活条件也会得到相应保障。,Russia will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure in the base and the living conditions of the Russian soldiers will be protected correspondingly.
2565,他还说，如果不对极端主义势力进行打击，这些势力会扩展到俄罗斯。,"He also said that if the extremist forces were not hit, these forces will be extended to Russia."
2566,虽然俄罗斯与西方没有在共同打击叙极端主义势力方面达成协议，但俄会在此方面加强与叙利亚、伊朗、伊拉克等方面的合作。,"Although Russia and the West did not reach an agreement on the cooperation against the extremist forces of Syria, Russia would strengthen cooperation with Syria, Iran and Iraq in this regard."
2567,2015年9月，俄罗斯应叙利亚政府邀请开始对叙极端主义势力进行军事打击。,"In September 2015, Russia, at the invitation of the Syrian government, began a military strike against Syrian extremist forces."
2568,今年3月15日，俄驻叙主要军事力量开始撤离，但俄方承诺会继续保留驻赫迈米姆空军基地和驻塔尔图斯海军基地。,"On March 15 this year, Russia's major military forces began to evacuate, but the Russian side promised to continue to retain the military base in Heimi Mimi and the naval base in Tartus."
2569,在老宅新生和成功乡创的案例中，何培均做了很好的示范：传承一间百年古宅，同时也讲述一块土地的传承故事。,"In the case of renovating old houses and successful startup in his hometown, He Peijun is making a good example: to inherit a 100-year old house and tell a story about the land heritage."
2570,如今，每年平均有10万人次会聚到竹山，或是带来各种各样的创意，或是寻求内心的宁静。,"Today, 100,000 people on average visit Zhushan each year, bringing a variety of ideas or seeking inner peace."
2571,其实，乡村和城市的关系应该是相互陪伴，就像母亲和孩子一样，没有强弱之分，没有需要谁来统治谁，应该是很温暖的。,"In fact, the relationship between the village and the city should companionship with, just like mother and child. No matter strong or weak. There is no need for any party to be governed by the other party. Such a relationship is warm."
2572,乡村开发没有什么固定的模式，但靠乡村自发的改变难乎其难，最重要的一点应该是让对的人到乡村去。,"There is no fixed pattern of rural development, but it is quite difficult to just rely on spontaneous rural changes. One of the most important changes is to let the right people go to villages."

2574,随着智能手机的普及，手机越来越好玩，刷微信、发微博乃至玩游戏、逛淘宝都成常态，很多人似乎须臾离不开手机，连开车的时候都停不下来。,"With the popularity of smart phones, mobile phones become more and more funny. WeChat, microblogging and even games, shopping on Taobao have become normal. It seems that many people cannot leave the phone for a moment, and cannot stop even when driving."
2575,《道路交通安全法》明令禁止开车玩手机，并将它定义为“妨碍安全驾驶行为”。,"According to ""Road Traffic Safety Act"", mobile phones playing are banned and defined as ""behavior preventing safe driving""."
2576,遗憾的是，因违法者众、取证难等原因，这种现象并没有受到应有惩处，法律规定几乎成了摆设。,"Unfortunately, due to some reasons such as the large number of illegal cases and difficulty in obtaining evidences, those people have never been punished and make the laws become a kind of decoration."
2577,如果交管部门都能下定决心向开车玩手机行为“宣战”，将这一措施常态化，这种违法行为就一定能受到遏制。,"If the traffic control department can be determined to declare war to the mobile phone playing behavior while driving and normalize such measures, such illegal behaviors will surely be curbed."

The revenue per mu increases every year and the income of professional farmers also have room for growth every year."
2586,股份量化到每一个村民，苏南农村集体经济改革的最大亮点就在于明晰农村集体经营性资产产权并探索政经分开。,"With shares quantifying to each villager, the highlight of the rural collective economic reform is to be clear about the property rights of rural collective management and exploring political and economic separation."
2587,2015年7月，无锡市锡山区安镇街道14个农村经济合作组织与所在村村委会“分账管理”，村委会履行农村公共事务管理，合作组织则主要从事经营。,"In July 2015, on Anzhen Street of Wuxi Xishan District, 14 rural economic cooperation organizations worked with the village committee to implement ""sub-account management"". The village committee implemented rural public affairs management while the cooperative organizations were mainly engaged in business."
2588,两个机构两本账，互不“搭界”，防止村干部参与集体资产经营发生腐败现象。,"With two accounts for two institutions, this can prevent the village cadres from participating in collective asset management corruption."
2589,江苏省农委副主任祝保平介绍说，江苏下一步将继续推动社区股份合作制改革，鼓励农民联合发展，建立村级的民主权力运行机制。,"Zhu Baoping, deputy director of the Jiangsu Provincial Agriculture Committee, said that the next step of Jiangsu government is to continue to promote the reform of community cooperation system, encourage farmers to jointly develop and establish a village-level democratic power operation mechanism."
2590,祝保平：进一步把改革往前推进，搞社区股份合作，把资产量化到社员，固定到农户，形成明确的产权。,"According to Zhu Baoping, they should further move forward the reform, engage in community shares cooperation, quantify the assets to members, fix it to farmers and produce clear property rights."
2591,通过互联网+，落实他的知情权，决策的参与权及民主管理的监督权，三个权利落实给农户，确实让它变成规范的股份合作的运行机制。,"Through the Internet +, we shall provide farmers with the rights to know, participate in decision-making and democratic management and turn such rights into standardized mechanism of cooperation."

2605,厦门姑娘张彬彬：“手型漂亮”开始射击之路职业生涯几经“逆转”,"Xiamen girl Zhang Binbin: ""handsome hands"" encourage her to start shooting career, which saw several ""reverse"""
2606,厦门翔安区东园村的张东红前几天刚把家中29寸的老电视，换成了65寸的大电视。,"Zhang Donghong, a villager of the East Park Village, Xiamen Xiang'an District, changed his 29-inch old TV into a 65-inch TV just a few days before."
2607,这位普通农民的女儿，就是11日晚为中国斩获里约奥运会女子50米步枪三姿决赛银牌的张彬彬。,"The ordinary farmer has a daughter, named Zhang Binbin. She is the one to win sanzi final silver medal of Olympic Games Women's 50-meters rifle games for China in the evening of the eleventh."
2608,11日夜，就在这部新电视前，张东红夫妇和几十位亲戚好友，一起见证了女儿一路奋起直追，从几乎预赛就被淘汰到差点大逆转的神奇过程。,"In the evening of the 11th day of the month, just in front of this new TV set, the Zhang Donghong couple and their dozens of relatives and friends have witnessed the magic process for the couple's daughter to catch up and reverse from almost being eliminated in the preliminaries to almost winning."
2609,在当日的比赛中，张彬彬一度排名中下游，似乎距离决赛十分遥远。,"At the game, Zhang Binbin was ranked in the middle and lower reaches and it seemed she was still quite far away from the final."
2610,但父母和亲朋好友没有放弃，不停地刷着文字直播，看到随着其他选手完赛，张彬彬名次一路提升，最终锁定决赛席位，其家中顿时爆发从一阵欢呼。,"But her parents and friends did not give up, kept watching the live and saw other players finish the game. Zhang Binbin raised her ranks all the way and finally came to the final. At this time, a burst of cheers broke out in her home."
2611,决赛中，张彬彬又是在一度排名靠后的情况下，最后几枪越打越稳，仅以落后冠军0.2环成绩夺得银牌。,"In the final, Zhang Binbin also started from lagging behind and shot more stably and won the silver medal with just 0.2 rings behind the champion."
2612,今年已经27岁的张彬彬，在16年的射击生涯中，其实有几度都差点与这块来之不易的银牌擦身而过。,"This year, the 27-year-old Zhang Binbin, in the 16-year shooting career, has actually missed the silver medal for several times."
2613,其母张小龙告诉记者，就在他们犹豫时，张彬彬找来了同村的几个“小说客”。,"According to her mother Zhang Xiaolong, her daughter sent a few ""little persuaders"" from her village at their hesitation."
2614,这些“小说客”是当年同时被推荐参加集训的同村小孩，其中还有张彬彬的表姐。,"These little persuaders are girls and boys of her village who were recommended to attend the training at the same time, including Zhang Binbin's cousin."
2615,就在进入厦门队后不久，张彬彬又一度因为家庭困难等原因，主动回到翔安的学校读书。,"Just after coming to Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin once again took the initiative to return to Xiang'an school because of her family difficulties."
2616,但是在其启蒙教练张亚杰反复做工作后，张彬彬又回到了厦门队。,"But after the repeated efforts of her enlightening teacher, Zhang Binbin returned to Xiamen team."
2617,而进入省队后，张彬彬又曾因为迟迟进不了国家队，一度因为看不到希望而再度回到家里。,"And after she came into the provincial team, Zhang Binbin returned home because she found it almost hopeless to enter the national team after a long time."
2618,这次，不仅张亚杰教练，厦门射击射箭运动中心和福建省队的领导和教练都来到家里，最终劝说张彬彬回到省队。,"This time, not only the coach Zhang Yajie, but also the leaders and coach of Xiamen shooting archery sports center and Fujian provincial team came to her home. With their efforts, Zhang Binbin was finally persuaded to return to the provincial team."
2619,就如同昨天的比赛，这位厦门姑娘的用坚持实现了射击之路上的一个个逆转。,"Just at yesterday's game, the Xiamen girl achieved several reversals of the shooting with her insistence."
2620,“每个教练挑选队员的方法不一样，当时我看到彬彬的手长得很漂亮，就一下子相中了。”,"""Each coach has his own method to choose the potential player. I decided to take her once I saw her beautiful hands."""
2621,张东红也回忆，在集训测试中，女儿虽然成绩不是最好，但打出的环数很稳定，这也是张彬彬吸引教练的重要原因。,"Zhang Donghong also recalled, in the training test, although the results of her daughter were not the best, her rings were very stable, which is also an important reason for Zhang Binbin to attract coaches."
2622,在训练张彬彬的过程中，张亚杰印象最深的，则是这位农家女孩的投入。,"During the training process of Zhang Binbin, it was the input of this farmer girl that impressed Zhang Yajie most."
2623,他回忆说，张彬彬进入厦门射击队一年后多，队里进行立射的持久举枪训练，要求队员半个小时不能动。,"He recalled that after Zhang Binbin came into the Xiamen shooting team more than a year later, the team carried out a long shot of gun training, requiring players not to move for half an hour."
2624,张小龙告诉记者，女儿一直是个安静乖巧的孩子，从小就喜欢画画和自制手工玩具，,"Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that her daughter has always been a quiet and well-behaved child, with the hobby of painting and producing toys."
2625,“原来我会在家里做做衣服、缝缝补补，彬彬就会捡一些边角料自己做娃娃。”,"""I used to make clothes and do some sowing jobs. Binbin picked up some scraps to make her own dolls."""
2626,她说，女儿常常会自己缝制手工玩具，加上她擅长画画，从娃娃的五官到衣饰，总能做得栩栩如生。,"She said, her daughter often sewed hand toys. Plus, she is good at painting and could make animated toys from the doll's facial features to clothing."
2627,作为运动员，张彬彬和家人聚少离多，只有节假日才能回家，平时多靠电话联系。,"As an athlete, Zhang Binbin and her family are separate more than being together. As she can only return home during festivities, she mainly contacts family members by phone in other time."
2628,父母说，无论是见面还是打电话，张彬彬很少说自己的辛苦，更多的是跟父母聊些开心的事。,"According to her parents, no matter meeting in person or talking by phone, Zhang Binbin seldom talked about her hard work but more about some happy things."
2629,平时见不到女儿，父母在家中将女儿小时候的画作以及历年的荣誉都细心收存着。,"Because they cannot often see their daughter, they put away the paintings of her childhood and honors of consecutive years."
2630,张小龙将女儿的动漫画作展示给记者，“如果没有当射击运动员，她应该还会继续画画”。,"Zhang Xiaolong showed the animation show of her daughter to the reporter, ""She should keep drawing instead if she did not become shooter."""
2631,而在张彬彬家二楼客厅，有一个柜子内放满了她所获得的奖章、奖牌和证书。,"In the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin, there was a cupboard filled with medals and certificates."
2632,张东红将奖牌和奖章整齐摆放，证书则统一放进了文件夹保存，“这些都是彬彬十几年心血换来的荣誉，我们都很珍惜。”,"Zhang Donghong put away the medals neatly and placed all certificates into files for storage. ""This is honor made by Binbin after a dozen of years' efforts. We feel quite cherished."""

2643,她指自己把钻石藏在内衣里，连续几日上厕所、洗澡都带着，走路睡觉都十分紧张。,"She buried the diamond in her lingerie and carried it all day along, including when she went to toilet and took bath."
2644,她称在安特卫普所买的钻石，购入价为每克拉约五万五千元，同品质的钻石在厦门的零售价约十一万一千元。,"She said the diamond she bought in Antwerp was priced about RMB 55,000 per gram and diamond of the same quality was retail-priced about RMB 111,000 in Xia'men."
2645,她日前以购入价加两成，把代购的钻石全部售出，一次过大赚二十万元。,"Recently, she sold the diamond with 120% more than the price she bought and earned two hundred thousand yuan."
2646,据内地海关规定，钻石非旅客于行程中的用品或必需品，故属于货品范畴，出入境时需申报，否则或列作走私，情况严重可被判入狱。,"According to the provisions of the Mainland Customs, diamonds are neither supplies nor necessities during the trip and thus belong to the scope of goods. So such diamond should be declared at entry and exit. Otherwise, it shall be classified as smuggling. People may be sentenced to jail."
2647,据外媒报道，当地时间10日，英国首相府唐宁街宣布：英国首相特蕾莎·梅将到瑞士度过暑假，但没有透露具体的休假地点。,"According to foreign media reports, on the 10th day of the month of the local time, the British Prime Minister's Downing Street announced that British Prime Minister Teresa Mei will go to Switzerland to spend the summer vacation, but did not disclose the specific place."
2648,有媒体称，在英国公投脱欧后，英国新首相选择到欧洲大陆上的“中立国”瑞士度假，带有某种政策象征性。,"According to some media, after the British referendum off Europe, the new British Prime Minister chose to spend her vacation on the ""neutral country"", Swiss on the European continent. This is symbolic."
2649,英国《卫报》评论称，瑞士这个中立国所代表的象征性在英国首相第一次度假地的选择上发挥了作用。,"The British ""Guardian"" commented that the symbolic neutrality nature of the Swiss played a role in the choice of the British Prime Minister's first resort."
2650,英国《每日电讯报》评论指出，特蕾莎·梅选择到瑞士度假，这是撒切尔夫人后，首次再有英国首相到瑞士度假。,"British ""Daily Telegraph"" commented that Teresa Mei chose to take a vacation in Switzerland. This is the first time that the British Prime Minister chose to go vacation in Swiss after Margaret Thatcher."
2651,两位女首相的选择和布莱尔和卡梅伦两位男首相喜欢到较热的地方度假形成了反差。,"The choice of these two female prime ministers is quite a contrast to the hot place which Blair and Cameron, the two male prime ministers like to go to."
2652,据悉，英国新首相特蕾莎·梅将在8月24日返回伦敦，之后等待她的是一系列重要工作和活动。,It is reported that the new British Prime Minister Teresa Mei will return to London on August 24. A series of important work and activities will be waiting for her.
2653,英国议会将于9月5日复会，辩论的议题中包括网上要求的举办第二次脱欧公投事宜。,The British parliament will resume on September 5. The subject matter covers the second Brexit referendum required by the internet.
2654,6月23日英国公投决定脱欧，但英国新首相不愿在年底前启动里斯本条约有关成员国脱欧的第50款内容。,"On June 23, the British held a referendum for Brexit, but the British new prime minister did not want to start the article 50, which is involved with the Lisbon Treaty before the end of the year."
2655,黄山市现存非物质文化遗产项目1325个，种类和数量均居全省第一。,"There are 1,325 existing intangible cultural heritage projects in Huangshan. Its number and quantity ranked first in Anhui province."
2656,由于徽文化非遗传承主要依赖口传面授，许多非遗濒临失传，运用数字化技术保存和保护势在必行。,"As the inheritance of intangible cultural heritage projects of Anhui province mainly relies on oral and face-to-face passage, many intangible cultural heritage projects are on the verge of failing to be handed down from past generations. So the application of digital technology for conservation is imperative."
2657,根据省人大常委会今年工作要点安排，常委会计划听取审议专项工作报告，并开展实施银行业监督管理法、服务地方经济发展情况专题询问。,"According to the work plan of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress this year, the Standing Committee plans to listen to the deliberation of special work report, and carry out the implementation of banking supervision and management law and special inquiry of serving local economic development."
2658,8月中旬，常委会将组织两个调研组赴部分市开展调研，为专题询问作准备。,"In mid-August, the Standing Committee will organize two research groups to conduct research in some cities to prepare for the special inquiry."
2659,花建慧指出，省人大常委会听取和审议垂直管理部门专项工作报告并开展专题询问，在我省尚属首次，是加强和拓展人大监督工作的积极探索。,Hua Jianhui pointed out that this was the first time that the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress listened to and deliberated on the special work report of vertical administration department and carry out special inquiries. It is the active exploration for enhancing and exploring the supervision work of the Provincial People's Congress.
2660,在新疆喀什的演习导演部，随着总导演的一声令下，武警驻喀什、和田、阿克苏三地的各部队迅速按照导调指令，实施机动集结，开赴演习作战地。,"In the director department of Kashi, Xinjiang, with the order of the director, the armed police in three regions, namely Kashi, Hotan and Aksu, followed the order quickly, implemented motor-driven and left for the exercise combat zone."
2661,中国的火星计划来了,China's Mars program is coming
2662,我国火星探测任务要一次实现环绕、着陆、巡视，这种形式在国外从没有过。,"China Mars exploration mission aims to achieve surrounding, landing and patrolling at one time, which has never occurred in foreign countries."
2663,我国的火星探测发射目标是想一步环绕、着陆、巡视，这个任务具有相当大的难度。,"China's Mars exploration launch target is to step around, land and patrol at one time. Such task has considerable difficulty."
2664,因为火星探测要26个月才能遇到一个时间窗口，所以专家们正在严密地制定工程计划，争取在2020年这个窗口发射我国第一个火星探测器。,"Because the Mars probe can encounter a time window in 26 months, experts are closely working on the project plan and try to launch the first Mars probe in 2020."
2665,据许达哲介绍，尽管我国的飞行器已经进入了深空，但是完成火星探测任务仍不可或缺，探测火星意味着中国从真正意义上迈入深空探测时代。,"According to Xu Dazhe, although China's aircraft has entered a deep space, it is still essential to finish the task of Mars exploration. The detection of Mars means that China has stepped into the deep space exploration era in a true sense."
2666,“每隔两年或三年，才有一次火星距离地球最近的机会，在这个时间点上发射火星探测器，对运载火箭来说是最省能量的。”,"""Every two or three years, there is a chance that Mars is closest to Earth. And at this point, it is most energy efficient to launch the vehicle."""
2667,“考虑到火星探测器的质量，将由我国长征五号运载火箭来完成发射任务。”,"""Taking into account the mass of Mars detectors, it will be the job of China's Long March 5 carrier rocket to complete the launch mission."""
2668,我国的火星探测任务要一次实现环绕、着陆、巡视，这种形式在国外是从没有过的，国外曾拟一次实现环绕和着陆，但着陆失败了。,"China's Mars exploration mission aims to achieve surrounding, landing and patrolling at one time, which has never occurred in foreign countries. There was one time of surrounding and landing before in foreign countries, but the landing failed."
2669,火星探测涉及的技术领域非常多，特别之处还在于，虽然火星车是一个空间探测器，但与一般空间探测器相比，它又具有鲜明的特点。,"Mars exploration involves a lot of technical areas. In particular, although the rover is a space detector, it has a distinctive feature compared with the general space detector."
2670,也就是说，火星探测器要具备确定行驶路线、发现障碍危险的能力。,"In other words, the Mars probe should be capable of determining the driving route and equipped with the ability to find obstacles."
2671,中国航天科技集团五院研究员庞之浩说，人类之所以对火星探测如此青睐，是因为探测火星具有重要的科学、技术等多方面意义，甚至关系到人类的未来。,"According to Pang Zhihao, a researcher of the fifth institute of China's Aerospace Science and Technology Group, the reason for human being to favor Mars exploration is because Mars detection has significant scientific and technical meanings and it even matters to the future of human beings."
2672,目前火星已成为除地球以外人类研究程度最高的行星，人类利用空间探测器进行火星探测的历史几乎贯穿整个人类航天史。,"Currently, the Mars has become the planet with the highest degree of human research. The history of human beings to use space detectors for Mars exploration almost goes across the entire history of human space exploration."
2673,因此，人类希望有朝一日在火星建立居住基地，最终向火星移民，把它变成人类的第二家园。,"Therefore, the human beings hope that one day on the Mars to establish a base of residence, and ultimately to Mars immigration, it turned into a second home of mankind."
2674,大量迹象还表明，火星以前很可能与目前的地球一样，只是经过几十亿年的演化才变成大气层稀薄、温度较低、水源枯竭等样子。,"A large number of signs also show that the Mars is likely to be the same as the current Earth, only after billions of years of evolution into the atmosphere thin, low temperature, water depletion and so on."
2675,因此，探测或载人登陆火星进行研究，可以为防止地球变成人类难以生存的第二个火星提出预案。,"Therefore, the detection or manned landing on the Mars for research can help propose a pre-arranged planning to prevent the earth from becoming the second Mars which is difficult for human beings to inhabit."
2676,截至2016年6月，全球共进行了114次月球探测，43次火星探测。,"As of June 2016, the world conducted a total of 114 lunar explorations, including 43 Mars detection missions."
2677,不过，从20世纪90年代至今，人类共进行了18次火星探测，而月球探测只进行了14次。,"However, ever since the 1990s, a total of 18 human explorations have been carried out and only 14 lunar detections have been conducted."
2678,目前有5个火星轨道器和2辆火星漫游车在工作，但只有1个月球轨道器和1个月球着陆器在工作。,"There are currently five Mars orbiters and two Mars rovers at work, but only one lunar orbiter and one lunar lander are at work."
2679,世界航天大国都制定了以火星系统为目标的探测计划，由此可见，当今的火星探测比月球探测还热。,World space powers have developed a detection plan with the Mars system as target. So we can see the current Mars detection is hotter than that of moon detection.
2680,2013年11月5日，印度发射了第一个火星探测器“曼加里安”，成为亚洲第一个成功探测火星的国家。,"On Nov. 5, 2013, India launched the first Mars probe ""Mangalian"", and has become Asia's first country for successful detection of the Mars."
2681,“曼加里安”用于研究火星表面、大气和矿物特征，探寻火星上是否有甲烷和生命迹象。,"""Mangalian"" is used to study the surface, the atmosphere and mineral characteristics of the Mars and explore whether there are signs of methane and life on the Mars."
2682,这次任务最难的地方，就是探测器进入火星大气后气动外形和降落伞减速只有一次机会,The hardest part of the mission is that the probe just has one chance before entering the Martian atmosphere for aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration.
2683,据中国航天科技集团公司五院总体部的火星探测器总设计师孙泽洲介绍，火星探测任务面临着许多技术挑战。,"According to Sun Zezhou, the chief designer of a Mars detector of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the Mars exploration task is confronted with many technical challenges."
2684,火星大气气压很低，只有地球表面大气压力的1%，具有很高的不确定性。,"The atmospheric pressure of the Mars is very low, only 1% of the Earth's surface atmospheric pressure, with high uncertainty."
2685,有关它的变化和风暴时特性等因素，科学家们还没有透彻的认识。,Scientists have not had a thorough understanding of Mars factors such as its changes and storm characteristics.
2686,火星在夏季常形成类似地球沙尘天气的尘暴，这会导致火星车接收的太阳光能量急剧下降，必须为火星车设计“休眠”模式，让其耐心地等待尘暴过去。,"A dust storm similar to the Earth's dust is often formed in the Mars in the summer, which will lead to a sharp decline in solar energy. So a ""sleep"" mode must be designed for the Mars rover and let it wait patiently until the disappearance of dust storms."
2687,同时，火星大气对太阳光照还有削减作用，这为火星探测的能源供给带来难题。,"At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a reducing effect on sunlight, which poses a problem for the energy supply for Mars detection."
2688,这就要求探测器的太阳翼面积更大，而且需不断调整，努力对准太阳方向。,"This requires that the detector's sun wing area to be larger, and need to constantly adjust, and strive to align with the sun direction."
2689,还有，火星表面重力只有地球的38%，但是比月球表面的重力大多了，因此探测器需要更大的功率。,"In addition, since the gravity of the Mars is only 38% of that of the earth and much higher than that of the Moon surface, so the probe requires higher power."
2690,“这次火星探测任务最核心、最难的地方，就是探测器进入火星大气后气动外形和降落伞减速的过程，只有一次机会，必须确保成功。”,"""The core and the most difficult part of the Mars exploration mission are the aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration process after the probe enters Martian atmosphere. There is just one chance to ensure success."""
2691,孙泽洲说，由于地球与火星距离遥远，整个过程无法由地面实时控制，所以必须依靠探测器自主完成。,"According to Sun Ze, it must rely on the detector to complete the entire process because the distance between the Earth and the Mars is quite large."
2692,由于没有那么多的推进剂来抵消那么高的速度，所以登陆火星时，减速要依靠火星大气的作用，然而火星大气难以在地面模拟。,"Because there is not so much propellant to offset the high speed, the slowdown should rely on the atmosphere of the Mars while landing the Mars. However, it is quite difficult to simulate the atmosphere of the Mars on earth."
2693,庞之浩说，总体来讲，探测火星的方式与探测月球的方式相似，也是“绕、落、巡、回”，最终实现载人登陆火星的目标。,"Pang Zhihao said, in general, the way to detect the Mars is similar to the way to detect the moon. The entire process is also ""surrounding, landing, patrolling and returning"" to achieve the goal of manned landing on the Mars."
2694,由于火星距离地球比月球距离地球要远得多，所以探测火星需要攻克一系列更复杂的技术难关。,"Because the distance between the Mars and the earth is larger than that between the Moon and Earth, it needs to overcome a series of more complex technical difficulties before the Mars detection."
2695,据台湾媒体报道，台“行政院长”林全昨天上午宣布，“政党及其附随组织不当取得财产处理条例”自今天起生效。,"According to Taiwanese media reports, Lin Quan, the head of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, announced yesterday morning, ""Ill-gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations by political parties and their accompanying organizations"" will take effective since today."
2696,国民党副主席詹启贤则表示，“一个一百多年历史的国民党，有社会的承诺跟责任，不会这样就倒闭”。,"KMT Vice Chairman Zhan Qixian said, ""Kuomintang, with a hundred years of history, will step down otherwise without social commitment and responsibility."""
2697,林全强调，如果政党、附随组织或受托管理人等违反条例所定禁止处分的规定，委员会将依职权调查并“依法”处分、裁罚。,"Lin Quan stressed that if the political party, accompanying organization or trustees are in violations of the regulations which prohibit provisions ban, the Commission will investigate and punish ""according to the law""."
2698,林全也宣布不当党产委员会的副主委人选，将由台“廉政署副署长”洪培根担任。,"Lin Quan also announced that Hong Peigen, ""Deputy Director of the Independent"", will serve as the vice chairman of the Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee."
2699,他说，由顾立雄担任不当党产委员会主委是不二人选，借用洪培根过去查察相关重大案件的经验，将作为委员会清查相关不当党产案件的基础。,He said that Gu Lixiong will be the most appropriate candidate for the Ill-gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations. The experience of Hong Peigen who dealt with the major cases will serve as the foundation for the committee to uncover the related Ill-gotten Party Assets.
2700,詹启贤认为，今天只要还有党产，没有人会给你社会捐款，若党产统统被充公收走，国民党刚好可请求社会支持与赞助，“今天真的没有了才有机会去要”。,"Zhan Qixian said that, as long as there are party assets today, no one will give you social donations. So if the party were all confiscated away, then Kuomintang can just ask for social support and sponsorship, ""You will have chance to go when there are no assets."""
2701,詹启贤也强调，就算不当党产条例上路后，国民党党产没被完全充公、没收，剩下的仍会依承诺捐出去，让党产准归零，党要一切从零开始。,"Zhan Qixian also stressed that even if the Ill-gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations goes into effect and the Kuomintang party assets are not fully confiscated, the rest will continue to be confiscated as promised, the party asset will go null and the party will start from scratch."
2702,原标题：“走廊医生”兰越峰诉央视主持人王志安名誉侵权一审败诉,"Original title: Suit launched by ""corridor doctor"" Lan Yuefeng against CCTV host Wang Zhi'an for reputation infringement fails in instance judgment"
2703,法制晚报讯因央视主持人王志安在新浪微博上发表针对“走廊医生”事件的言论，兰越峰将王志安及北京微梦创科网络技术有限公司诉至法院。,"The legal evening news: Because the CCTV host Wang Zhi'an published his remarks against the ""corridor doctor"" event on microblogging, Lan Yuefeng brought Wang Zhi'an and Beijing Micro Dream Chuangke Network Technology Co., Ltd. to the court."
2704,昨天下午，海淀法院对该案进行了宣判，判决认定王志安及微梦公司不构成侵权，驳回了兰越峰的全部诉讼请求。,"Yesterday afternoon, Haidian court sentenced the case and the verdict said that Wang Zhi'an and Micro Dream Company did not constitute the infringement and dismissed the Lan Yuefeng for all the claims."
2705,2014年初，央视记者王志安调查发现，尽管在医院走廊里坐了600多天的兰越峰被媒体塑造为被体制打压的悲情英雄，但这些报道存在大量不实信息。,"At the beginning of 2014, CCTV reporter Wang Zhi'an found after his survey that although Lan Yuefeng was sitting in the corridor for more than 600 days and was shaped as the tragic hero suppressed by the media, these reports had a lot of false information."
2706,2014年3月29日，央视新闻调查制作的《走廊医生》节目播出。,"On March 29, 2014, the ""corridor doctor"" program produced by CCTV news survey broadcasted."
2707,兰越峰向媒体举报的各种所谓过度医疗的信息，均没有证据支持。,All information about the so-called over-medical treatment reported by Lan Yuefeng to the media do not have any evidence support.
2708,王志安也在实名认证的微博中，描述“兰越峰之所以走到这一步是性格使然、其带有明显的偏执人格等”。,"In the microblogging with real-name certification, Wang Zhi'an also said that the reason for Lan Yuefeng to become this is because of his stubborn characters and paranoid personality""."
2709,兰越峰提出要求王志安删除微博、向其致歉并赔偿精神损害抚慰金10万元。,"Lan Yuefeng claimed that Wang Zhi'an should delete the microblogging and apologized to him and made compensation of 100,000 yuan for the mental damage solatium."
2710,在当时的庭审中，双方就王志安是否侵犯了兰越峰的名誉权进行了激辩。,"At the time of the trial, the two sides argued whether Wang Zhian violated the reputation right of Lan Yuefeng."
2711,12日看点：田径开赛中国队很忙女足冲四自行车盼突破,"Highlight of the 12th day of the month: at the beginning of Track and Field Events, the Chinese team is quite busy and the women's football association aims to become the top four of the bicycle games"
2712,自行车有望实现奥运金牌“零突破”，而女足姑娘将挑战两次世界冠军得主德国队，期待爆冷冲进四强。,"The bicycle game is expected to realize the ""zero breakthrough"" in the Olympic gold medal while the Women's World Cup girls will challenge Germany team, the world champion winner for twice and are expected to become the top four."
2713,王镇近两个赛季状态突出，去年北京田径世锦赛收获银牌，今年5月团体竞走世锦赛上又升级个人项目冠军。,Wang Zhen was quite outstanding in the two races. He won silver medal for the athletics world championship held in Beijing last year and was upgraded to the individual project champion in the world championship this May.
2714,据外媒报道，27岁的韩国射箭女选手张慧珍在女子射箭个人赛中获得金牌，继团体赛后再获奥运会金牌，成为双冠王。,"According to foreign media reports, Zhang Huizhen, the 27-year-old Korean archery female player won the gold medal in the women's archery individual tournament. This is the second scoring of Olympic gold medal following the team competition. This made she become a double winner."
2715,张慧珍被认为是一名大器晚成的选手，她曾遗憾未获上届伦敦奥运会的入场券，如今却骄傲地站在了里约奥运的最高领奖台上。,"Zhang Huizhen is considered as a late bloomer. She regrets about not winning the last session of the London Olympic Games tickets before, but now she proudly stands on the top of the Rio Olympic podium."
2716,张惠珍在在巴西里约桑巴大道体育馆举行的女子射箭个人赛决赛中以总比分6-2击败德国的丽萨·翁鲁，获得了金牌。,"Zhang Huizhen won the gold medal in Lisa Wenglu, a total score of 6-2 in the women's archery finals at the Samba Boulevard in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."
2717,她在小学四年级时才第一次射箭，直到27岁的2014年才在世界杯赛上首次获得个人赛金牌，是一位成名较晚的选手。,She did archery for the first time in the fourth grade of primary school. She won the first individual tournament gold medal when she was 27 in 2014. So she is a late bloomer.
2718,张惠珍回忆道，“上中学以前没有什么水平，以至于无法参加全国的比赛。,"Zhang Huizhen recalled, ""My performance before high school was too bad to enable me to participate in the national competition."
2719,张惠珍在四年前的伦敦奥运会选手选拔赛上仅获第四名，憾失奥运入场券，只能坐视同事兼好友奇甫倍夺两枚金牌。,"Zhang Huizhen was ranked the fourth at the London Olympic Games qualification trials. Unfortunately, she lost the Olympic admission and can just watch her colleague and good friend Qi Pubei score two gold medals."
2720,张惠珍在女子射箭个人赛颁奖仪式结束后谈了自己的夺金感言，“直至最后都是尽可能地一发一发地射箭，可能是这带来了好结果，心满意足。,"Zhang Huizhen talked about his gold winning after the women's individual awards ceremony of archery. ""I tried to shoot one by one until the last. Maybe it is because this brings me good results and makes me contented."""
2721,28岁的韩国射箭“一姐”、伦敦奥运会射箭个人赛金牌获得者奇甫倍获得了铜牌。,"The 28-year-old Korean archery ""No.1"", and the London Olympic Games archery individual tournament winner Qi Fubei won the bronze medal."
2722,奇甫倍在半决赛中输给张惠珍，与墨西哥选手亚力杭德拉·瓦伦西亚展开铜牌争夺。,Qi Fubei was defeated by Zhang Huizhen in the semifinals and competed for the bronze medal with the Mexican player Alexandra Valencia.
2723,奇甫倍在确保铜牌后泪洒赛场，其间默默承受的冲金负担可想而知。,"Qi Fubei shed tears after she knew she won the blonde medal. At this time, we can know her pressure."
2724,首先是教练组在不断研究中积累了丰富经验，其次是科学的训练方式，这些都是需要长期积累的。,"Firstly, the coaching staff accumulated rich experience in his gradual study. Secondly, it needs scientific training, which should be accumulated over time."
2725,射箭队以军训、夜间穿越墓地等方法帮助队员集中注意力并保持平常心。,The Archery team helped the team players focus and remain unbiased via military training and going through the cemetery during night.
2726,尽管还没有被证实，但诸多消息源都表示，苹果2016年秋季发布会将在9月举行，iPhone7真要来了。,"Although not yet confirmed, it is said by many sources that Apple's 2016 autumn conference will be held in September, and iPhone7 would really be launched into the market."
2727,虽然苹果公司并未回应，但有关新iPhone的功能、配置已经陆续有消息放出，甚至网上连iPhone7“真机模型”图片都有了。,"Although Apple did not respond, there are news release about the function and configuration of the new iPhone. There are even the images of iPhone7 ""real machine model"" on the internet."
2728,新一代iPhone可谓“万众瞩目”，火热、紧俏、有钱无货……如果你想第一时间购买到正品，一定要选择一个好渠道，比如说，苏宁。,"The new generation of iPhone is really ""eye-catching"", hot and hard-to-get. If you want to buy the genuine product at the first time, you must choose a good channel, for example, Suning."
2729,这加剧了人们对于新手机的失望，“它加长了，却根本不能投射全息图像!这一代iPhone糟透了。”,"This has exacerbated people's disappointment of the new iPhone, ""It is lengthened, but cannot be used to cast holographic images! This generation of iPhone is so terrible."""
2730,iPhone7像其他iPhone一样，出生之前就伴随着无数秘闻。,"iPhone7, just like other iPhones, brings countless secret before birth."
2731,另外，还有多个消息源声称，新一代iPhone将取消3.5mm耳机接口，转而使用蓝牙连接和充电接口，这将为苹果增加第二个扬声器提供空间。,"In addition, there are a number of sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will have the 3.5mm headphone jack cancelled, and adopt Bluetooth connection and charging interface instead, which will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker."
2732,能佐证这一消息的另一证据是，早在2014年苹果就允许耳机厂商生产通过充电接口连接的耳机产品。,"Another evidence to support this news is that as early as 2014, Apple will allow headset manufacturers to produce headset products via producing charging interface."
2733,这些消息或真或假，答案直到苹果2016秋季发布会才能揭晓。,Another evidence to confirm this message is that Apple allows the headphone manufacturer to produce headphone via the connection of charge interface.
2734,但这并不妨碍业内人士看好iPhone7的前景——许多人认为，iPhone7将很有可能成为苹果对iPhone系列的最后一次大幅升级。,Whether these news are true or false will not be unveiled until the 2016 Apple autumn conference.
2735,虽然从不久前市场研究机构IDC公布的数据来看，iPhone的市场份额有所下滑。,"But this does not prevent the industry insiders to be optimistic about the prospects of iPhone7 - many people think that iPhone7 will be likely to become the last major upgrade of Apple's iPhone series, although it can be seen from the data released by the market research institution IDC that the market share of iPhone will decline to some degree."
2736,其中，高盛将苹果的股票维持“买入”评级，而BMO的分析师则认为iPhone7将收获一份历史性的销售成绩。,"Among them, Goldman Sachs ranked Apple's stock to be the rating of ""buying"" while BMO analyst thought that iPhone7 will obtain a historical high sales achievement."
2737,同时博通公司的CEO Hock Tan也表示，苹果未来的营收增加将有可能超过20%，而这完全得益于iPhone7的推出。,"Meanwhile, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also said that Apple's future revenue growth will likely be more than 20%, which is entirely due to the introduction of iPhone7."
2738,有7%的受访者表示他们有购买iPhone7的打算，而两年前计划购买iPhone6的人数比例只有4%。,"7% of respondents said they have the plan to buy iPhone7, while only 4% people had the plan to buy iPhone6."
2739,据了解，目前持有iPhone6或6Plus的用户群体有20%计划购买iPhone7，这是一个相当高的比例。,It is understood that currently 20% of user groups of iPhone6 or 6Plus have such a plan to purchase iPhone7. This is a quite high proportion.
2740,其次，有专家分析，大部分果粉都喜欢隔代更换自己的iPhone手机。,"Secondly, according to expert analysis, most of the iPhone fans like to replace their own iPhone mobile phone."
2741,据统计，在所有的iPhone用户中，有大约26%的用户已经2年没有更换手机了，也就是差不多有1.2亿的用户的iPhone已经用了2年。,"According to statistics, among all iPhone users, about 26% of users have not changed their phones for 2 years. That is, almost 120 million users of iPhones have been using the same iPhone for 2 years."
2742,有媒体称，iPhone7生产期间，台湾遭遇数次地震，“台积电生产设施的受破坏程度超出想象，并有可能对初期的iPhone7供应产生影响。”,"According to media, Taiwan witnessed several earthquakes during the production period of iPhone7. ""The destruction of TSMC production facilities is beyond imagination and may impact the initial supply of iPhone7."""

In order to regulate the management order of tourism FIT market, yesterday Urumqi City Tourism Law Enforcement Detachment worked with the law enforcement detachment of Urumqi Transportation Authority to investigate and deal with the non-normative travel vehicles existent in the tourism FIT market, and the low contract signing between the travel agency and tourists."
2779,昨天早上八点，在凯宾斯基酒店周围停了约10辆满载游客的大巴车，这些车辆大多都是前往天池一日游的散客团。,"At 8 O'clock of yesterday morning, around 10 buses packed with tourists parked around the Kempinski Hotel. These vehicles are mostly individual group that went for Tianchi One Day Tour."
2780,“你好，我是乌鲁木齐市旅游局的，你们跟这个旅行社签合同了嘛？”,"""Hello, I am from the Urumqi City Tourism Bureau. Did you sign with the travel agency?"""

2786,8月12日上午，国务院新闻办就2016年7月份国民经济运行情况举行新闻发布会。,"On the morning of August 12, the State Council Information Office held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in July 2016."
2787,国家统计局新闻发言人、国民经济综合统计司司长盛来运表示，7月份，国民经济部分指标增速有所放缓，但仍运行在合理区间。,"Sheng Yunyun, spokesman of National Bureau of Statistics and head of National Economic Statistics Division said that, in July, the part index number of national economy slowed relatively but still operated in the reasonable range."
2788,国家统计局发布的数据显示，7月份固定资产投资增速、进口总额等数据有所回落。,"According to the data of National Bureau of Statistics, the fixed asset investment growth, total imports and other data in July have come down."
2789,盛来运说，关于7月份的国民经济运行情况，我想借用总理曾经讲过的一句话“形有波动，势仍向好”，这能够比较好地概括7月份的经济运行的特征。,"Sheng Laiyun said, as for the national economy in July, I would like to use the words of Premier, ""the shape is volatile and the potential is still good"". This is a better way to summarize the characteristics of the economic operation in July."
2790,他解释“形有波动”是指7月份部分经济指标增速确实是有所回落。,"He explained that ""the shape of the fluctuations"" refers to the fall after rise of some economic indicators growth rate in July."
2791,因为7月份国内外经济仍处在深度调整之中，国际形势复杂多变，世界经济的复苏不及预期，所以出口压力还是比较大。,"In July, the domestic and international economy is still in the deep adjustment, the international situation is complex and volatile and the world economic recovery is less than expected, so the export pressure is still relatively heavy."
2792,从国内情况看，整个经济还处在调整的关键阶段，调整的阵痛在释放，经济面临不小的下行压力，所以有些指标有些波动。,"As for the domestic situation, the whole economy is still in the critical stage of adjustment, adjustment labor pains are releasing and the economy is under great pressure, so some indicators are still fluctuating."
2793,盛来运指出，7月份还有一个特殊情况，洪涝灾害比较严重，高温酷暑天气对一些地区的生产经营带来了一些影响。,"Sheng Laiyun pointed out that there was a special case in July, with serious floods, high temperature and hot weather which have brought some impact on production and operation of some areas."
2794,根据民政部最近发布的情况，全国6000多万人受灾，直接经济损失超过2000亿元。,"According to the recent report of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people were affected, with direct economic losses of more than 200 billion yuan."
2795,从工业、投资、交通运输相关指标看，这些地区不同程度受到影响。,"From the view of industrial, investment and transport-related indicators, these areas are affected to varying degrees."
2796,7月份的货物周转运量增速比上月回落3.6个百分点，洪涝灾害对这些地区的交通有一定的影响。,The cargo turnover growth rate in July fell back 3.6 percentage and floods on these areas have a certain impact on traffic.
2797,从这些因素来看，7月份部分指标出现波动也是很正常，也是在预期之中。,"From these factors, it is quite normal to have some fluctuations in some indicators. And such thing is expected."
2798,他表示，“势仍向好”指的是尽管经济增速有所回落，但是经济运行总体平稳，稳中有进、稳中向好的大势没有变。,"He said, ""The potential is still good"" means that despite the fallback of economic growth, the overall economic performance is stable and steady. And the good momentum has not changed."
2799,7月份CPI上涨1.8%，环比上涨0.2%;1-7月份CPI上涨2.1%，所以物价形势总体稳定。,"In July, CPI rose by 1.8%, with a month-on-month rise of 0.2%. From January to July, CPI rose by 2.1%, so the overall price situation is stable."
2800,根据重庆市气象局门户网对各区县高温天气的统计，除酉阳外，我市其余各地都能领取到不同程度的高温津贴。,"According to the statistics of hot weather in the districts and counties by the portal of the Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Meteorology, in addition to Youyang, the rest of the city can receive different degrees of high temperature allowance."
2801,目前全国至少已有28个省份明确了津贴发放标准，不过各省市发放的标准并不一样，而重庆则是按高温工作日津贴的方式领取高温津贴。,"At present, at least 28 provinces in the country have clearly defined the standard of the allowance, but the standards issued by provinces and municipalities are not the same, and people in Chongqing receive the allowance based on the count of high-temperature working days."
2802,35℃以上37℃以下的，按每人每天不低于10元标准发放；37℃以上的，按每人每天不低于15元标准发放。,"In case of temperature between 35 and 37 ℃, people can receive allowance of no less than 10 yuan per day. In case of temperature above 37℃, people are released with the allowance of not less than 15 yuan."
2803,40℃以上高温工作人员每月最多可领20元/天的津贴（劳动者已经依法享受高温作业岗位津贴的除外）。,"In case of temperature above 40℃, staff working in high temperature can receive up to 20 yuan per day of allowance (but for laborers who enjoy the high temperature job allowance)."
2804,按照这一标准，上个月高温天气天数最多的开州能领到330元，天数最少的城口则是80元，而酉阳最高温由于没达到高温标准外，所以没有高温津贴。,"In accordance with this standard, people in Kaizhou which has the highest number of high temperature can receive 330 yuan. And people in Chengkou with the least days of high temperature can receive 80 yuan. And the maximum temperature of Youyang did not meet the high temperature standards, so there is no high temperature allowance."
2805,以往不少单位会以清凉饮品冲抵高温津贴，市安监局表示这种行径不合乎现行办法。,"In the past, many companies adopt cool drinks as high temperature allowance. The city safety supervision bureau deemed that this behavior does not meet the current regulation."
2806,因高温天气停止工作、缩短工作时间的，用人单位不得扣除或降低劳动者工资。,Employer shall not deduct or reduce the wages of workers in case of terminating work and reducing working hours in high temperature weather.
2807,市人社局表示，员工遇到高温下作业却没收到高温津贴的，可通过企业所在的劳动争议调解机构争取合法权益，或拨打12333投诉。,"The city's Human Resources and Social Security Bureau said that if employees did not receive high temperature allowance while working under high temperature, they may fight for the legitimate rights and interests via the labor dispute mediation organization or dial 12333 for complaint."
2808,有用人单位拒不发放高温津贴的，劳动者可向用工所在地县级以上人力资源社会保障主管部门投诉。,"If the employing unit refuses to pay the high temperature allowance, the laborer may lodge a complaint with the competent department of human resources social security at the county level or above."
2809,同时由于高温津贴是工资的一部分，不是福利，要纳入工资总额、扣减个税。,"At the same time, because the high temperature allowance is part of the wage and not welfare, such allowance shall be included in the total wages, with tax deducted."
2810,因此高温津贴不在最低工资范围内，必须以现金形式发放，不能用饮料等实物代替。,"So the high temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage, it must be issued in cash and not substituted by physical objects such as drinks."
2811,新建成的乌鲁木齐站位于乌鲁木齐市高铁片区，整个建筑面积约有10万平方米。,"The newly built Urumqi station is located in Urumqi high-speed rail area, with the whole construction area of around 100,000 square meters."
2812,地上1、2层为进站、候车厅及办公、商业用房，地下1层是出站层。,"The layer 1 and 2 are for entrance, waiting room and office, commercial use while the layer -1 is for exit."
2813,目前，乌鲁木齐站是新疆最大的综合交通枢纽，集高铁、轨道交通、公交、出租等为一体，可实现各种换乘方式无缝对接。,"At present, Urumqi station is Xinjiang's largest integrated transport hub, integrated with high-speed rail, rail transportation, public transportation and rental as one. People can achieve a variety of seamless dockings."
2814,站台层南北两侧和出站层北侧共有3个售票厅，配置了39个人工售票窗口和34台自动售取票机。,"There are a total of 3 ticket offices on the north and south sides of the platform layer, equipped with manual ticketing windows and 34 automatic ticket machines."
2815,检票方面，在候车大厅东西两侧共有30个通道，旅客可根据车票上的检票口编号，进行快速查验、候车。,There are a total of 30 channels on the east and west side of the waiting hall. Passengers can check the ticket on the ticket number for quick inspection and waiting.
2816,如果需要帮助，可就近按动站内设置的41个呼唤按钮进行选择，就可以获得及时服务。,"If you need help, you can choose the 41 call buttons and get timely services."
2817,从7月1号起，老客站，也就是乌鲁木齐南站的旅客列车就分步开行到了乌鲁木齐站。,"From July 1 onwards, the old passenger station, that is, the passenger train of Urumqi South Station is shifted to Urumqi station."
2818,也就是说，所有动车和30对出疆列车都可以在乌鲁木齐站停车。,"In other words, all the CRH trains and the 30 pairs of other trains departing from Xinjiang can be parked at Urumqi Station."
2819,现在两个站均可以买票乘车，他们之间的列车通行时间在10分钟左右，旅客需要注意票面始发和终点站的具体站名。,"Now, passengers can buy tickets at these two stations. The train passing time between these two stations is about 10 minutes. Passengers need to pay attention to the detailed name of the initial and terminal station on the ticket."
2820,乌鲁木齐新客站的正式投入运营将成为新疆打造全国性综合交通城市的重要平台，推进“丝绸之路经济带”和新区建设。,"Urumqi new passenger station, after its official launching into operation, will become an important platform to build the national integrated transport city and promote the construction of ""Silk Road Economic Zone"" and the new district."
2821,格雷西亚是一只萌萌的雌性巨嘴鸟，浑身散发着热带雨林的气息。,"Gracia is a cute female toucan, exuding the breath of tropical rain forest."
2822,在中美洲国家哥斯达黎加，巨嘴鸟格雷西亚和它的故事早已家喻户晓。,"In Costa Rica, one of the Central American countries, Toucan Gracia and its story have long been known."
2823,8月10日的新闻发布会上，术后康复的格雷西亚终于亮相，向人们展示它崭新的3D打印塑料鸟喙。,"At the press conference on August 10, after postoperative rehabilitation, Gresham finally appeared and showed people its brand new 3D printing plastic beak."
2824,这只一年半前被人折断上喙、奄奄一息的巨嘴鸟，如今终于重获新生。,"This toucan, which had its beak broken and was dying just one year and a half ago, finally regained its new life."
2825,这一天不仅宣告着它已100%恢复健康，更是它搬进豪华鸟舍、与关心它的人类朋友们见面的日子。,"This day not only announced that it has restored health by 100%, but also signaled its moving into the luxury aviary to meet its human friends."
2826,初进新家的格雷西亚稍显腼腆，但不多时就变得活泼起来，在水盆里打滚嬉闹，用新喙吃葡萄。,"The newcomer Grecia was slightly shy initially, but soon became lively, rolling in the basin frolic and eating grapes with a new beak."
2827,为了提醒人们它曾经遭受的伤害，技术人员没有给它的新喙上色，而是保留了3D打印材料原有的白色。,"In order to remind people that it has suffered damage, the technical staff did not give it a new beak color, but to retain the original white color of the 3D print material."
2828,鸟喙外是一层薄薄的角质鞘，里面中空，只有一些细细的骨质支撑杆交错排列。,"The beak is a thin layer of horny sheath, which is hollow inside and only has some of the thin bone to support."
2829,虽然有这种内部加固成份，巨嘴鸟的喙还是脆弱，受到伤害时会破碎。,"Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's beak is fragile and may be broken when it is hurt."
2830,动物救助中心、鸟类学家和一家美国3D打印公司通力合作，为格雷西亚制作了好几个“试验喙”，终于造出最适合它的“完美喙”。,"Animal rescue center, ornithologist and a US 3D printing company worked together to prepare several ""test beak"" for Gracia and finally built a ""perfect beak"" for it."
2831,如今格雷西亚已能熟练使用新喙喝水、吃东西，甚至啄起细小谷粒。,"Now Gracia has been able to use the new beak to drink water, eat, and even peck fine grains."
2832,“最终成品的设计花了大约2个月，打印出来只需4、5个小时。”,"""The design of the finished product costs about two months and it just takes 4-5 hours to print it."""
2833,“3D打印并不是未来技术，它已经实实在在走进了你我的生活。”美国SG3D打印公司董事长托马斯·朗格在接受新华国际记者采访时说。,"""3D printing is not the future technology but really enters into your life."" Thomas Lange, the chairman of US SG3D printing company said in an interview with Xinhua International."
2834,2015年1月，在哥斯达黎加中部阿拉胡埃拉省格雷西亚的一个农场，浑身是血的巨嘴鸟格雷西亚被人发现。,"In January 2015, Gracia, lying on a farm in the town of Alajuela in the middle of Costa Rica, was found with blood covering on its body."
2835,当时它的上喙被一伙年轻人残忍折断，它完全无法进食，生命垂危。,"At that time, its beak was cruelly broken by a group of young people. It was completely unable to eat and dying."
2836,格雷西亚的惨状经媒体报道后，在哥斯达黎加内外引起如潮的反对虐待动物呼声。,"After the tragedy of the Gracia was reported by the media, there are a tide of animal anti-abuse call occurring inside and outside Costa Rica."
2837,人们要求设立更为严格的动物保护法、加大对虐待者的惩罚力度。,People demand to establish more rigorous animal protection law to enhance the punishment against abusers.
2838,人们自发前来，尽最大努力帮助格雷西亚尽可能恢复受伤前的生活。,People came spontaneously to try their utmost to help Gracia restore its life before hurting.
2839,甚至3D打印技术发明人查克·赫尔也参与到格雷西亚上喙的设计中来。,"Even the inventor of the 3D printing technology, Chuck Hull, is also involved in the design of the Gracia beak."
2840,“格雷西亚的情况很特殊，它的上喙剩余部分不足1厘米，所以给安装新喙带来许多困难。”,"""The situation of Gracia is very special, and its remaining part of the beak is less than 1 centimeter, so there are many difficulties in installing the new beak."""
2841,“我们先对格雷西亚扫描，然后设计、制作出一个稍长于它上喙剩余部分的延长假体，用粘胶固定在它的上喙上。”,"""We first scanned Gracia and then designed and produced an extended prosthesis slightly longer than the rest of its beak and fixed on its beak with glue."""
2842,“这样可以减少对格雷西亚造成进一步侵入性伤害。”朗格对新华国际记者说。,"""This can reduce the risk of further intrusive damage to Gracia,"" Lange told Xinhua International."
2843,在安装假体之前，工作人员每天都要为格雷西亚清理断喙，以防感染。,"Before installing the prosthesis, the staff cleared the broken beak of Gracia every day to prevent infection."
2844,远在千里之外，巨嘴鸟格雷西亚的故事感动了著名纪录片导演葆拉·埃雷迪亚和探索新闻频道制片人约翰·霍夫曼。,"Thousands of miles away, the story of the Toucan Gracia touched the famous documentary director Paula El Reidia and the news channel producer John Hoffman."
2845,他们记录下格雷西亚安装新喙过程中的点点滴滴，录制了一部纪录片《巨嘴鸟之国》，已于本月在动物星球频道上播放。,"They recorded a little bit of the process of installing a new beak, and recorded a documentary ""The Country of Toucan"", which was played this month on the Animal Planet Channel."
2846,纪录片《巨嘴鸟之国》向人们展示，一只小小的巨嘴鸟是如何让一个国家为之改变、如何让国民都参与到反对虐待动物当中来。,"The documentary ""The State of the Toucan"" shows people how a small Toucan has changed a country and how people get involved in the fight against torture of animals."
2847,核心提示：日本油企尤其对被称为“茶壶”的中国小型独立炼油厂崛起表示警惕。,"Core Tip: Japanese oil companies expressed vigilance to the rise of Chinese oil companies, especially known as the ""teapot"" of China's small independent refinery."
2848,参考消息网8月12日报道日媒称，日本最大的石油企业JX能源认为，“中国的出口扩大是行情低迷的原因之一。,"August 12 report on Cankaoxiaoxi website: Japan's largest oil company JX Energy believes that ""China's export expansion is one of the reasons for the market downturn."""
2849,日本油企尤其对被称为“茶壶”的中国小型独立炼油厂崛起表示警惕。,"Japanese oil companies expressed vigilance to the rise of Chinese oil companies, especially known as the ""teapot"" of China's small independent refinery."
2850,中国的石油产品品质因中国政府强化环保规定正在逐渐接近日本的油品。,China's oil products are gradually close to Japan's oil products because the Chinese government has strengthened environmental protection regulations.
2851,在获得原油进口许可之前，“茶壶炼油厂”一般从俄罗斯等地进口硫磺含量较高的重油进行提炼。,"Before obtaining the import license for crude oil, ""teapot refinery"" generally refines oil from the heavy oil, which has high sulfur content and is imported from Russia."
2852,生产出来的石油产品硫磺含量较高，油品不佳，成为造成环境污染的原因之一。,The petroleum products are poor in quality due to high sulfur content and become one of the causes of environmental pollution.
2853,在获得原油进口许可后，“茶壶炼油厂”能够进口硫磺含量较低的阿曼产原油和俄罗斯产原油，其石油产品的品质也出现提升。,"After obtaining crude oil import license, ""teapot refinery"" can import Oman crude oil and Russian crude oil, which have low sulfur content and improved petroleum products."
2854,东燃通用石油公司表示，“随着中国国内的石油产品品质标准不断提高，炼油设备的能力也出现提升。,"East Fuel General Oil Company said, ""With China's domestic oil product quality standards continuing to improve, the refining capacity of the equipment also increased."
2855,结果，中国对外出口的石油产品品质逐渐达到与（世界最高品质的）日本相同的水平”。,"As a result, the quality of oil products exported from China gradually rivalled that of Japan (the world's highest quality)."
2856,JX能源表示，“2015年底之后，中国开始向澳大利亚出口高品质的轻油”，在亚洲市场上与日本产品形成竞争。,"According to JX Energy, ""After the end of 2015, China began to export high-quality light oil to Australia."" Such light oil products are competitive with Japanese products on the Asian market."
2857,尽管“日本高品油”正在面临危机，但日本油企采取的应对策略仅为“关注市场行情的同时向有利润可图的地区出口”。,"Although the ""Japanese high quality oil"" falls into a crisis, the Japanese oil companies just adopted the strategy of ""exporting to profitable areas while being concerned about the market""."
2858,由于中国出口的石油产品对亚洲市场行情的影响巨大，对茶壶炼油厂的关注度也越来越高。,"As China's exports of petroleum products have a huge impact on the Asian market, teapot refinery got more attentions."
2859,2016年扬子晚报利群阳光助学行动自5月26日启动，经过两个月的报名，申请助学金的贫困学子总人数达800多人。,"2016 Liqun sunshine student support action of Yangtze Evening News started from May 26. After two months of registration, the total number of poor students applying for grants is up to 800."

2862,为确保助学行动公正、公开、透明，本报今日起分批公示学子基本信息，今天公示第1—100名，接受读者监督。,"In order to ensure that the student action is fair, open and transparent, the newspaper today announced the basic information of the students. The names of the first 100 students will be publicized today to receive the supervision of readers."
2863,利群阳光助学行动，是中国著名慈善品牌，扬子晚报利群阳光助学行动2003年起在江苏开展，资助贫困学子累计超过4000名。,"""Liqun sunshine student action"" is a well-known Chinese charity brand. Yangzi Evening News Liqun sunshine student action has been initiated in Jiangsu since 2003. More than 4,000 students have been supported."
2864,"该活动资助范围是高考本科录取新生,不含免学费专业；品学兼优，家庭贫困。","The scope of the fund covers college entrance freshmen, excluding tuition-free majors. Students qualified for the fund should have excellent study performance and family poverty."
2865,统计局表示，新西兰人口增幅此前仅在１９７４年和上世纪５０年代到６０年代早期的“婴儿潮”人口出生高峰时期超过２％。,"According to the statistics bureau, the population growth of New Zealand had previously exceeded 2% in 1974 and during the 1950s-1960s (""baby boom"")."
2866,截至今年６月，新西兰１２个月内移民净流入数量为６.９１万人，成为新西兰近年来人口增长的主要驱动力。,"As of June this year, New Zealand's net inflow of immigrants within 12 months was 69,100, making it the main driver of New Zealand's population growth in recent years."
2867,另外，在相同时间段，新西兰人口自然增长数量为２.８２万人。,"In addition, in the same period, New Zealand's population increased by 28,200."
2868,数据显示，最近１０年里，新西兰年均移民净流入数量为２.１８万人，年均人口自然增长数量为３.２３万人。,"Data shows that in the last 10 years, the average annual net inflow of immigrants in New Zealand is 21,800, with natural population growth of 32,300 people."
2869,从人口结构上看，大量移民涌入意味着１５岁至３９岁的“劳动年龄人口”比例逐步扩大。,"From the population structure point of view, a large influx of immigrants means that the ratio of ""working age population"" aged 15 to 39 years old gradually expanded."
2870,截至２０１６年６月的１２个月时间里，新西兰劳动年龄人口增长３.６％，达到１５８万人。,"As of June 2016, New Zealand's working-age population rose by 3.6 percent to 1.58 million."

A total of 338,000 tons of goods have been transported. Among them, 84 freight trains began operation in 2016, a year-on-year increase of 47%."
2876,据了解，中亚班列首趟运载的货物均为“陕西制造”，而如今，它已吸引大量的外地货源积极上列。,"It is understood that the first carriage of goods of Sino-Asia freight trains are ""Made in Shaanxi"". And now, it has attracted a large number of foreign sources."
2877,截至7月底，中亚班列集装箱到发量突破6.4万标箱，较2015年同期增长8%。,"As of the end of July, the volume of container received for Sino-Asia freight trains reached 64,000 TEU, an increase of 8% over the same period in 2015."
2878,随着中亚班列的加密开行，西安铁路局新筑车站货运量逐年提升。,"With the increase of the operation of Sino-Asia freight trains, the freight volume of the Xinzhu Railway Station of Xi'an Railway Bureau increased year by year."
2879,2015年，新筑车站全年货运吞吐量247.7万吨，截至2016年8月10日，货运发送量已经达到153.1万吨，较去年同期增长6.7%。,"In 2015, the cargo throughput of the Xinzhu Railway Station of the whole year reached 2.477 million tons. As of August 10, 2016, the volume of cargo has reached 1.531 million tons, representing an increase of 6.7% over the same period last year."
2880,为了满足未来发展需要，西安铁路局以新筑车站为中心的西安新筑铁路综合物流中心建设规划已经出台，全力打造现代化的新筑铁路综合物流园区。,"In order to meet the needs of future development, the Construction Planning of Xi'an New Integrated Logistics Center has been introduced, with Xi'an Xinzhu railway station as a focus, endeavoring to build a modern new railway integrated logistics park."
2881,印度一名大叔上周刚在迪拜国际机场经历飞机机腹着陆惊魂，本周就在同一座机场中了100万美元大奖。,A mid-aged man in India last week experienced airplane belly landing shock at Dubai International Airport. He won US$1 million award in the same airport last week.
2882,久居阿联酋迪拜的印度人穆罕默德·巴希尔·阿卜杜勒·赫达尔每次回国都有买彩票的习惯。,"Muhammad Bashir Abdul Hedar, who long lives in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, has a habit of buying lottery tickets every time he returns."
2883,他21岁的儿子在出生13天时因意外坠落导致瘫痪，他一直辛苦工作偿还儿子的医疗费用贷款。,His 21-year-old son suffered from paralysis due to accidental fall 13 days after his birth. He has toiled day in day out to repay his son's medical expenses loan.

2885,虽说现在已经立秋，可是“秋老虎”的威力似乎一点不比夏天差。,"Although now it is the beginning of autumn, the power of ""afterheat"" seems not to be weaker at all than that in the summer."
2886,紫外线不仅让同学们的皮肤变黑，更加会晒伤肌肤，如何让肌肤能顺利度过军训，不被晒伤？,"UV not only tans your skin but also sunburns it, so how to make the skin go through the military training, without sunburn?"
2887,防晒霜包装上一般都标有SPF和PA，SPF是指防晒指数，是针对UVB紫外线的，我们常见的SPF指数有15、30、50等。,"Sunblock is generally marked with SPF and PA on the package. SPF refers to Sun Protection Function and is targeted at UVB. The common SPF index includes 15, 30, 50, etc."
2888,标有PA的产品是针对UVA的，这样防晒品会发挥更加有效的作用，通常情况下，PA的强度用+来表示，多一个+表示有效防护时间延长。,"The product marked with PA is for UVA, so that sunblock will play a more effective role. Usually, the intensity of PA is represented with +. An extra + indicates extension of effective protection time."
2889,油性肌肤应选择渗透力较强的水性防晒用品，防晒喷雾也是不错的选择。,Water-based sunblock with a strong penetration is often applied to oily skin. Sunscreen spray is also a good choice.
2890,干性肌肤应选择霜状的防晒用品;中性皮肤一般无严格规定，敏感性肌肤擦上任何保养品都是一种负担，建议选纯物理性防晒产品。,Creamy sunscreen is often applied to dry skin. The classification of neutral skin generally has no strict rules. Any kind of skin care products are burden to the sensitive skin. So it is recommended to choose pure physical sunscreen products.
2891,切记提前半小时涂防晒霜，因为防晒产品需要时间才能完全渗入到皮肤。,"Remember to apply sunblock half an hour in advance, because sunscreen products take time to completely penetrate into the skin."
2892,军训日晒时间较长，防晒霜每隔两小时擦一次才能有持久效果，千万不要偷懒。,"Because you are exposed to sun longer during the military training, you have to apply the sunscreen products once every two hours to lengthen the effect. So keep doing it."
2893,由于皮肤刚受到日晒刺激的缘故，军训回来不要立刻用美白产品。,"As the skin has just been stimulated by the sun's sake, do not immediately use whitening products after returning from military training."
2894,军训暴晒后，如有条件可用毛巾包着冰块来冰镇被灼伤的皮肤以减缓局部燥热。,"After exposure under the blazing sun for quite a long time, please wrap the ice with towel to ease the sunburned skin and alleviate the local heat if condition allowed."
2895,在展会期间购买农机的农户，继续实行累加补贴政策，农户购买农机最高可得到40%的补贴。,The cumulative subsidy policy will be remain available for buying agricultural machinery during the exhibition and farmers can get agricultural subsidies of up to 40%.
2896,本届展会面向全球招商招展，特别是加大了对“一带一路”沿线国家和目标市场国家的邀请力度。,"This trade show attracts investment and exhibition worldwide. In particular, it enhances the invitation on countries and target market countries related to the Belt and Road Initiative."
2897,本届展会力争完成招商签约项目60个、引进资金220亿元，签订贸易合同160个以上，合同金额32亿元。,"This exhibition strives to accomplish 60 investment signing projects, introduce 22 billion yuan of fund, sign more than 160 trade contracts, which totaled 3.2 billion Yuan."
2898,据悉，“湘博会”之所以连续7年落户娄底，缘于湖南省娄底市制造产业基础雄厚，产业发展历史久远。,"It is reported that the reason for ""Hunan Fair"" to be settled in Loudi for seven consecutive years is the strong foundation of manufacturing industry in Loudi, Hunan, which boasted long history of industrial development."
2899,作为“湘博会”的主办地，娄底已与全世界90多个国家建立了贸易往来关系。,"As the host place of ""Hunan Exposition"", Loudi has established trade relationship with more than 90 countries around the world."
2900,“湘博会”成为当地培育特色产业发展、推动特色产业走出国门的重要平台。,"""Hunan Exposition"" has become an important platform for the local place to cultivate the development of characteristic industries and promote the ""going-out"" of characteristic industries."
2901,在有些夜晚，电离层充满自由电子，这意味着，无线电信号可以走得更远。,"During some nights, the ionized layer is full of free electrons, which means that the radio signal can go further."
2902,据美国《大众科学》月刊网站8月11日报道，美国空军对复制这一效应感兴趣。,"According to the report of Popular Science, an American monthly website, on August 11, the US Air Force was interested in copying this effect."
2903,虽然拥有稳定的大量自由电子的电离层可以帮助人们在某个大学广播电台的播送范围边缘收听这个电台，但这或许不是美国空军的兴趣所在。,"Although the stable ionizing layer with a large number of free electrons may help people listen to the radio at the edge of a university radio station, but this may not be the interest of the US Air Force."
2904,充满电子的电离层意味着，军方使用的无线电有着更大的播送范围，并且它或许会为全球定位系统（GPS）信号提供一些保护，使之免受太阳风暴的影响。,"Ionization layer full of electrons indicated the radio used by the military has a larger range of broadcasts. In addition, it may prevent the global positioning system (GPS) signal from the solar storm."
2905,最终目标可能是根据需求打造一系列立方体卫星，它们可以在需要的时候加强电离层。,The final goal may be to build a series of cube satellite according to the requirement. They may enhance ionization layer when necessary.
2906,但首先，这些同空军签订合同的团队必须证明有关科学原理会奏效。,"But firstly, the team that signed contract with the air force must prove that the scientific principles will work."
2907,行业数据显示，2015年煤炭产能总规模接近60亿吨，全国煤炭产能过剩18亿吨。,Industry data showed that the total size of coal production in 2015 was close to 6 billion tons and the national coal production overcapacity reached 1.8 billion tons.
2908,近十年来，国务院前后共发布过5次淘汰过剩与落后产能的通知。,"Over the past decade, the State Council has issued a total of five notices for the elimination of excessive and backward production capacity."
2909,虽然前4次没有针对煤炭行业，但目标行业直接与煤炭业产生关系。,"Although the first four notices are not directly involved with coal industry, the target industry is directly related with coal industry."
2910,去年11月到今年1月，秦皇岛5500大卡动力煤价格长期在370元/吨低位徘徊，90%的煤炭企业陷入亏损。,"From last November to this January, the price of Qinhuangdao 5500 kcal steam coal lingers at 370 yuan/ton and 90% of the coal enterprises fell into a loss."
2911,而2月份以来，煤价逐步回升，近期秦皇岛动力煤价格更是连续上涨四周，上升到16个月来的高点，一度攀升到每吨436元，比年初上涨近70元。,"And since February, coal prices gradually picked up, Qinhuangdao steam coal prices rose continuously for four weeks, rose to 16 months high, once climbed to 436 yuan per ton, up nearly 70 yuan per ton over the beginning."
2912,随着价格回升，各界担心随之产生：一批小煤矿会不会复工复产？,"With the price rising, come along the concerns of various industries: will a number of small coal mines resume production?"
2913,对此，中国（海南）改革发展研究院经济所所长匡贤明进行了分析与解读。,"In this regard, Kuang Xianming, head of the Economic Research Institute of the China (Hainan) Reform and Development Institute, conducted an analysis and interpretation."
2914,匡贤明：去产能引起了各方的高度关注，今天公布的煤炭行业去产能的成绩单也确实让大家感到比较担心。,Kuang Xianming: overcapacity cut roused the high concerns to various industries. The report card of the overcapacity cut of the coal industry announced today make everyone feel worried indeed.
2915,这三个表层的因素还是反映出了过去我们的增长方式转变相对滞后的原因，就是由政府主导的增长方式至今还没有得到根本性的转变。,"These three superficial factors reflect the reason behind the relative lagging behind of our growth pattern change. That is, the government-led growth has not yet been fundamentally changed."
2916,第二，这也与地方政府的推进力度直接相关，在去产能的过程中，资金和相应的配套措施都要到位，从这个方面看来，不同地区的差异确实比较大。,"Second, it is also directly related with the force of local government. During the overcapacity cut process, the funds and the corresponding supporting measures should be in place. From this point of view, the differences are indeed relatively large among different regions."
2917,第三，如果目前进度比较慢的一些省份要在下半年赶进度，它们可能会面临较大的风险。,"Thirdly, some of the provinces that are relatively slow in progress may face greater risks if they seek acceleration in progress in the second half of the year."
2918,在这种情况下，依靠中央奖补资金来推进去产能的进程可能会产生一定负面的影响。,"In this case, relying on the central allowance to raise funds to promote the process of production capacity may have a negative impact."
2919,首先，去产能不是简单的进行总量控制。,"First, the overcapacity cut is not a simple cap control."
2920,我们的目的是要通过淘汰落后的产能，推进结构的优化，重构整个煤炭行业的新业态。,"Our goal is to eliminate the backward production capacity, promote the optimization of the structure and restructure the new format of the entire coal industry."
2921,在部署去产能的过程中，地方政府一定要把去产能和煤炭产业的转型升级结合起来，大力发展相关的服务业。,"During the process of overcapacity cut deploying, the local government must combine the production capacity and the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry to develop the relevant service industry."
2922,第二，要想在今年年内完成今年的去产能任务，我们还是要充分发挥行政监督和行政监察的力量。,"Second, in order to complete this year's overcapacity cut task within this year, we must give full play to the power of administrative supervision."
2923,最后，我们要加强社会保障的兜底作用。,"Finally, we should strengthen the role of social security."
2924,因为市场直接涉及到就业的问题，所以我们要加强对员工和职工的就业技能培训。,"Because the market is directly related to the employment problem, we have to strengthen the employment skills training of employees."
2925,“排名下降的原因是外资对于中期内巴西GDP发展的预期恶化。”,"""The reason for the ranking decline is that Brazilian GDP growth is expected to worsen in the medium term."""
2926,2015年，巴西在全球直接投资中的参与度为3.7%，低于2014年的5.7%。,"In 2015, Brazil's participation in global direct investment was 3.7%, down from 5.7% in 2014."
2927,瑞信银行国际投资吸引力指数包括4个分项指数：基础设施、经济前景、商业环境和直接投资量。,"The International Investment Attractiveness Index of Credit Suisse Bank includes four sub-indices: infrastructure, economic outlook, business environment and direct investment."

2929,去年，在巴西的“绿地投资”(到国外投资设厂的投资模式)为179亿美元，同比减少了2.1%。,"Last year, Brazil's ""green investment"" (in the investment model of building factories abroad) was $17.9 billion, a year-on-year fall of 2.1%."
2930,“在巴西共有288个‘绿地投资’项目，而2003年至2014年的年平均量为314个”。,"""There are 288 'green land investment' projects in Brazil, with an average annual rise of 314 from 2003 to 2014""."
2931,不过，2016年上半年，在巴西的国际直接投资已达到338亿美元，和去年同期相比几乎增加了10%。,"However, in the first half of 2016, the international direct investment in Brazil had reached $33.8 billion, an increase of almost 10 per cent compared to the same period last year."

2953,宁泽涛在100米自由泳半决赛中的表现，已经让很多中国观众无语。,Ning Zetao's performance in the 100 meters freestyle semi-final has made a lot of Chinese audience speechless.
2954,可就在50米自由泳预赛中，宁泽涛再一次刷新了人们的“底线”。,"Actually, this 50-meter freestyle is not the subject of Ning Zetao. His performance and best achievement in Kazan World Championships also indicate it is not possible for him to make breakthrough in this project."
2955,其实50米自由泳并非宁泽涛主项，他在喀山世锦赛上的表现和最好成绩，也决定了他在这个项目取得突破的可能性不大。,"Sure enough, Ta Kung Pao, an authoritative media in Hong Kong, revealed that the biggest reason for Ning Zetao to lose is that he has lost interest in swimming."
2956,果然，香港权威媒体《大公报》透露，宁泽涛失利的最大原因，就在于他已经失去了对游泳的兴趣。,Many factors may have a great impact on his future ideas. He is now more interested in entering the entertainment circle.
2957,场外的许多因素，可能对他对未来的想法产生了很大影响，他现在对进军娱乐圈可能更感兴趣。,"After Kazan World Championships, Ning Zetao instantly become celebrity with his good look and excellent performance."
2958,喀山世锦赛后，宁泽涛凭借其超高颜值和好成绩，瞬间成为网红。,"As a result, ""national husband (a good match)"", ""fresh little meat"", ""gorgeous"", etc. have become his label."
2959,于是，“国民老公”、“小鲜肉”、“花样美男”等称呼也不断成为他身上的标签。,A variety of business activities came to him. He really have a golden flashing prospect.
2960,各种商业活动找上门来，美好的钱途，成为一条金光闪烁的大道。,"In this case, that Ning Zetao chooses to withdraw and joins the entertainment circle, is not only his freedom, but also a seemingly viable way."
2961,在这种情况下，宁泽涛即使选择在此时退役加入娱乐圈，不仅是他的自由，也是一条看似可行的道路。,"After all, he is only 23 years old. After a certain degree of study, he can perform some TV series with his popularity."
2962,毕竟他只有23岁，经过一定的学习，完全可以凭借其人气出演一两部电视剧。,But Ning Zetao needs to see whether he is qualified enough compared with his predecessors.
2963,但宁泽涛需要看看，自己和这些前辈相比，是不是具备了足够的资格呢？,"At the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, the already 21-year-old Liu Xuan came to the end of athlete career."
2964,2000年悉尼奥运会，已经21岁的刘璇已经来到了运动员生涯的末期。,The beautiful appearance of Liu Xuan makes her quickly remembered and also lays a foundation for her to join the entertainment circle.
2965,刘璇靓丽的外表让她迅速被人们记住，也奠定了她今后进军娱乐圈的基础。,"After retirement, Liu Xuan starred in a number of TV series, and in 2013 she set up her own studio."
2966,退役后，刘璇出演了多部电视剧，并在2013年成立了自己的工作室。,"Tian Liang participated in the single and double ten-meter match of two Olympic Games, and won 2 gold and 2 silver."
2967,田亮参加了两次奥运会的单双人十米台比赛，并获得了2金2银。,"But when he was defeated by his counterpart Hu Jia at the single 10-meter match in the 2004 Olympic Games, Tian Liang's competitive state slipped and it was said he was dismissed by the diving team."
2968,但在2004年奥运会单人十米台比赛中输给队友胡佳后，田亮的竞技状态出现下滑，并被爆出被跳水队开除。,"But when he took along his daughter to participate in the variety show ""Dad, Where Are We Going?"", he became a focus."
2969,而他和女儿参加“爸爸去哪”等综艺节目，更是让他赚足了眼球。,"The once gold generation Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and Chen Yibing all participated in a variety of variety show."
2970,曾经的体操黄金一代杨威、李小鹏以及陈一冰都高调参加各种综艺节目。,"It is worth mentioning that, Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng led the Chinese team and won champion in the 2008 Olympic Games men's team. Yang Wei even got his individual all-around gold medal twice and was called as the Almighty King."
2971,值得一提的是，杨威李小鹏当时带领中国获得了2008年奥运会男团冠军，杨威更是两次拿到个人全能金牌，被称为全能王。,And Chen Yibing has become a ring king while leading his team to win the champion in the 2012 Olympic Games men's team.
2972,而陈一冰则在率领中国拿到2012年奥运团体冠军的同时，也成为了吊环王。,"But after he was misjudged and lost the gold in the London Olympic Games, his magnanimous act won him so many funs."
2973,而在伦敦奥运会上遭遇误判痛失金牌的后，陈一冰大度的举动，也让他圈粉无数。,"However, these game players mainly focus on the venue, they just touch and then go at the variety show."
2974,但这些运动员目前的主要精力依旧在赛场，对于综艺节目也只是如蜻蜓点水般——碰下就走。,"However, no matter whether they are retired or active athletes, they need to provide outstanding performance to win in the entertainment circle."
2975,但无论是退役还是现役运动员，能够得到娱乐圈的青睐都需要有拿得出手的成绩做保障。,"After all, athletes have just stepped into a new area, so it is just a space state for them in case of capabilities and connection."
2976,毕竟运动员踏入一个新的领域，无论是能力还是人脉，均是一个空白状态。,"Even for Tian Liang and Liu Xuan, who are not new in the entertainment circle, common people always think of their performance at the Olympic Games when mentioning them."
2977,即使是田亮、刘璇这样混迹娱乐圈多年的“老人”，普通观众提起他们，更多的还是想到他们在奥运会上的表现。,And the introduction of Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng at the variety show is always Olympic Games Champion.
2978,而杨威、李小鹏等新人，在综艺节目出场时的介绍，无一例外都是“奥运冠军”。,"Compared with these people, Ning Zetao is slightly weaker for the title of Swimming World Championships."
2979,相比于以上几个人，宁泽涛一个游泳世锦赛冠军的名头还是略显单薄。,"Compared with these people, the title of Ning Zetao, a swimming world championship, is not so great."
2980,更何况，相比于田亮、刘璇、杨威等人的功成身退，宁泽涛若在23岁、运动生涯稍遇挫折就急流勇退，对其形象造成的负面影响大概也是不可估量。,"Moreover, compared with the withdrawal of Tian Liang, Liu Xuan and Yang Wei, etc. at their peaks, the withdrawal of Ning Zetao at 23 after some setback would cause immeasurable effects to the negative influence of his image."
2981,毕竟，提起运动员，人们的要求都是“不求百战百胜，但求不畏艰险”，宁泽涛距离这一点还差了不少。,"After all, at the mention of athletes, people's requirements on athletes are ""not seeking victory but for no fear of danger"". Ning Zetao lags far behind from this point."
2982,退一万步说，宁泽涛长得帅，完全可以依靠颜值获得万千脑残粉的支持。,"At the very least, Ning Zetao can totally rely on his great looks to win the support of thousands of huge fans."
2983,没点功力，只靠外表，想在娱乐圈混好，这难度不比好好训练找回应有的状态难吧。,It is a lot more difficult to be famous in the entertainment circle by just relying on good appearance than training.
2984,人生之路选择全凭个人意愿，但到底如何选择，宁泽涛心里应该有数。,"You have to listen to your inner voice on your life path. But as for how to choose, Ning Zetao should be quite conscious."
2985,从表面上看，网络社交平台扩大了交际圈，降低了人们的孤独感。,"On the surface, the online social platform expands our social circle and reduces people's loneliness."
2986,网络社交的势力范围越发广泛，不仅逐渐取代传统的电话联络，甚至渗入到线下真实的生活圈，悄然改变当下民众的社交生活。,"The sphere of influence of social networking not only replaces the traditional telephone contact, but also gets down to the offline living circle, quietly changing the current social life of the people."
2987,线上社交的好处是显而易见的，比如方便快捷，所以特别容易受到年轻族群的青睐。,"The benefits of online social network are obvious, convenient and quick, so it is particularly vulnerable to the favor of young people."
2988,一项针对大学生社交习惯的调查显示，57%的大学生每天使用手机的时间超过5小时，日常生活基本“机不离手”。,A survey of college students' social habits shows that 57% of college students spend more than 5 hours on mobile phone and is almost inseparable to his mobile phone during their daily lives.
2989,“社交网络具有低成本、传输速度快、多人同时交流等特点，符合当代大学生的需求。”,"""Social network features low cost, fast transmission speed and simultaneous communication among several people. This meets the requirement of modern college students."""
2990,扩大人际关系圈，更平等地对话，避免社交顾虑，才是我们越发深爱线上聊的主要原因。,"Expanding the interpersonal relationship circle, more equal dialogue, avoiding social concerns are major reasons for us to be fascinated with online chat."
2991,刚进公司的新人热爱跟同事线上交流，“因为才进单位大家不太熟，通过社交平台的点赞评论，关系才比以前近了许多”。,"New comers in the company love online exchange with colleagues. ""We are not familiar with each other when we just come to the company. The likes and comments on social platform makes people much closer to one another. """
2992,爱交友的也常用线上交流，“之前跟朋友因为一些误会有段时间没联络了，后来在一个大群里先对话几句才又热络起来。”,"People who love to make friends also love online communication. ""I lost contact with my friends due to some misunderstandings. We became familiar again after a few dialogues on the group chatting."""
2993,IT工程师吴言是深度网络社交爱好者，他大部分的社交生活都发生于线上，网络联系人更数倍于线下朋友圈人数。,IT engineer Wu Yan is a profound social networking lovers. His majority social life occurred online and his online contact is several times than that of offline friends.
2994,吴言自己也坦言在网络上更“如鱼得水”。,"Wu Yan himself admitted that the network is more ""in his element""."
2995,“可以在自己方便愿意的时候回复朋友，因为有很多斟酌字句的时间，表述也能更清楚。”,"""You can respond to your friends when you are willing, because there is a lot of time to think over the words and you can express it more clearly."
2996,“隐藏在ID之下的你来我往避免了面对面的人际碰撞，不仅有了回旋的余地，甚至给了彼此更多思忖言行的时间和空间。”,"""The communication hidden below one's ID can avoid interpersonal clash. This not only has room for maneuver, and even gives each other more time and space to thought and deeds."""
2997,“不同身份的人有了同样发言的权利和效率，现实生活中的种种社交顾虑，在网络空间似乎都一下消除。”,"""People of different identities have the same rights and efficiency to speech. Various social concerns during real life may be eliminated immediately on internet."""
2998,然而吴言的朋友小鹏却觉得，生活中的吴言是个“蛮无趣的宅男”。,"However, Xiaopeng, a friend of Wu Yan, thought that Wu Yan is a ""very boring otaku."""
2999,小鹏和吴言在一个大群里相识，因为两人都是积极发言者，很快就熟络起来了。,Xiaopeng and Wuyan meet each other in the group chatting. They two get familiar with each other because they are active speakers.
3000,小鹏觉得吴言跟网络上判若两人，言语枯燥，也不主动发表意见，翻来覆去就是几句“呵呵，好的，是吗”，要不就是“这个我要上网查一下”。,"Xiaopeng thought that Wuyan is quite different from the one on internet. He is quite bored and does not take the initiative to express his views. His words are repeated like this, ""Oh, yes, right"", or ""I will check it online""."

3054,黄伊琳是中南林科大风景园林学院2015级的学生。,Huang Yilin was a student of grade 2015 in the Landscape Architecture College of Central South University of Forestry and Technology.
3055,就读城乡规划专业的黄伊琳想去四川阆中参观学习当地的建筑设计，于是一家人便前往旅游。,"Majored in urban and rural planning, Huang Yilin wanted to visit Sichuan Langzhong and learn the local architectural design, so the family were bound for there."
3056,8月8日上午10点左右，黄伊琳的父亲在酒店休息，母女俩出来准备逛逛阆中古城。,"At around 10 a.m. on August 8th, Huang Yilin's father was having a rest in the hotel, while Huang Yilin and his mother went to stroll the Langzhong ancient city."
3057,刚走了没多远，突然看到一群人在大呼小叫，出于好奇便走上前去。,"Not walking too far, they saw a group of people shouting, so they approached for curiosity."
3058,眼看着“小男孩已不见了踪影，小女孩在水里拼命扑腾，江面上只露出她的小脑袋，不时往下沉”，小时候学过游泳的黄伊琳急急忙忙地跳下去救人。,"Seeing the ""little boy has just disappeared and the little girl desperately fluttered in the water, just with her little brain left above the water and keeping sinking"", Huang Yilin, who learned how to swim hurriedly jumped to rescue people."
3059,下水后，身高165厘米的黄伊琳发现竟踩不到底!,"After jumping into the water, the 165cm-tall Huang Yilin found that she cannot touch the bottom!"
3060,之前看上去平静的水面，底下却是激流!,The calm-looking river had rapids in the bottom.
3061,但她还是不顾一切地游向小女孩。,But she still desperately swam to the little girl.
3062,黄伊琳说，江水浑浊、湍急，不到5米的距离，几乎花光了她所有的力气。,Huang Yilin said the river was muddy and run fast. The only 5-meter distance almost wore her out.
3063,她拼尽全力把小女孩推到河堤边，“斜坡特别滑，我怕自己没有力气也沉下去了。”,"She tried her best to push the little girl to the embankment. ""The slope is particularly slippery, and I am afraid that I have no strength but to sink."""
3064,于是，黄伊琳向妈妈求救，听到女儿的呼救，水性不好的尹女士准备下水营救，被旁边的游客拦住。,"So Huang Yilin called to her mother for help. Hearing her daughter's call, Ms.Yin tried to rescue and was held up by other people."
3065,8月10日，黄伊琳跳江救人的事情传开后，尹女士在收到不少亲友慰问、称赞的同时，也受到不少亲友“问责”。,"On August 10, after the spread of the event of Huang Yilin's jumping into the river for rescue. Ms. Yin received the condolences and compliments of a lot of friends and relatives as well as the ""concerns"" of many relatives and friends."
3066,“现在回想起来真的很后怕!说实话，当孩子在河堤上快坚持不下去了，向我求救时，我的心都快碎了。”,"""Now, in retrospect, it's really scared! To be honest, when my child does not hold on to the riverbank, my heart is broken soon."""
3067,尹女士心有余悸地说，尽管很危险，但如果再次置身那样的场景，她依然会支持女儿的选择，她为女儿骄傲!,"Ms. Yin said with a lingering fear that, despite the danger, she will still support her daughter's choice and she is proud of her daughter even if she was placed in that scene again!"
3068,由于是被逼的，黄伊琳在学会游泳之后就很少主动再下水了，“没想到这项技能还真派上了用场”。,"Because she was forced to learn swimming, she seldom went to swim after mastering the skill. ""I did not expect this skill really to come in handy."""
3069,据黄伊琳班上的班长陈亦暘介绍，黄伊琳是班里公认的“学霸”，而且乐于助人。,"According to Chen Yiyang, her supervisor, Huang Yilin is the ""The Straight A Student"" well-known in her class and ready to help."

3084,9月1日起，60岁至64岁的老年人可以半价乘坐城区的公交车。,"From September 1, people aged 60 years old to 64 years old can take bus by half-price ticket."
3085,11日上午，济宁市公交公司IC卡销售中心，办卡窗口前几位老年人正在排队办卡，62岁的姚大爷拿到老年半价卡。,"In the morning of September 11, at Jining City Bus Company IC Card Sales Center, several elderly people are queuing to apply for a card. The 62-year-old Yao obtained his half-price card for the elderly."
3086,此前，济宁市老龄委、市财政局、市交通局下发《关于60—64周岁老年人半价乘坐城区公交车的通知》，该优惠政策从今年的9月1日正式实施。,"Prior to this, Jining Municipal Committee for Aging People, the Municipal Finance Bureau, and the Municipal Department of Transportation worked together to issue ""A Notice for 60-64 years old people to take bus by half-price ticket"". The preferential policy will be implemented formally since this September 1."

3093,群发诈骗短信达到一定数量，即使未诈骗得手，也可以诈骗罪论处。,People who sent a certain amount of mass fraud messages may be punished for crime of swindling even if they did not succeed in fraud.
3094,河南省南阳市卧龙区人民法院审理查明，２０１５年９月３０日至１０月４日，被告人李会旺先后在桐柏县、南阳城区利用伪基站设备发送诈骗信息。,"The court trial of Nanyang Wolong District People's Court of Henan province found that the defendant Li Huiwang sent fraud information through the pseudo-base station equipment in Tongbai county and Nanyang district between September 30, 2009 and October 4, 2009."
3095,同年，１０月５日１０时许，被告人再次来到南阳市卧龙区某宾馆房间内利用伪基站群发诈骗短信时，被公安民警抓获。,"In the same year, at 10 a.m. on October 5, 2009, the defendant once again came to a hotel room of Nanyang City Wolong District, where they sent fraud messages via a fake base station. He was arrested by the police."
3096,经评估，该伪基站设备在２０１５年１０月４日发送短信６２２２８条，造成６２２２８个手机用户人均通讯中断８秒以上至１０分钟以下。,"After the assessment, the pseudo-base station equipment sent 62,228 text messages on October 4, 2015. This resulted in 8 seconds to 10 minutes of interruption of 62,228 mobile phone users."
3097,法院经审理认为，被告人李会旺利用伪基站对不特定多数人发送诈骗短信共计６２２２８条，其行为已构成诈骗罪。,"After legal proceedings, the court held that the defendant Li Huiwang used pseudo-base station to send a total of 62,228 fraud messages to a specific number of people. His behavior already constituted a crime of fraud."
3098,对于辩护人提出的被告人被抓时系未遂犯、未造成后果，认罪态度较好，建议对其从轻处罚的意见予以采纳。,"As the defendant was attempted criminal, not resulting in terrible consequences and having good attitude toward admission of guilt while being caught, it is advisable to take the opinion of giving a lesser punishment."
3099,综合被告人犯罪性质、认罪态度等情节，以诈骗罪判处其有期徒刑４年零６个月，并处罚金１万元。,"Consider the comprehensive crime nature and the attitude toward admission of guilt of the defendant, he was sentenced to 4 years and 6 months of imprisonment, and fined 10,000 yuan."
3100,东北虎，目前被世界自然保护联盟(IUCN)濒危物种红色名录列为濒危(EN)物种。,Siberian tigers are currently classified as endangered (EN) by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List of Endangered Species.
3101,据吉林省林业厅介绍，1998年中美俄等国联合监测的数据显示，吉林省仅有野生东北虎4到6只、东北豹3到5只。,"According to the Jilin Provincial Forestry Department, the data jointly monitored by the United States and Russia and other countries in 1998 showed that Jilin Province only had 4 to 6 manchurian tigers and 3 to 5 Northeast leopards."
3102,据吉林省林业厅保护处处长于长春介绍，近年来吉林省不断加大对野生动物的保护，东北虎、东北豹在中国的种群数量正显著增长，分布区域不断扩展。,"According to Yu Changchun, the Director of Jilin Provincial Department of Forestry Protection, Jilin province has gradually enhanced its conservation on wild animals in recent years. The number of populations of manchurian tigers and Northeastern leopards is growing significantly"
3103,2015年最新监测数据显示，仅吉林省境内就监测到野生东北虎27只、东北豹42只。,The latest monitoring data in 2015 showed that 27 wild manchurian tigers and 42 Northeastern leopards were monitored within Jilin province territory.
3104,作为分布在中俄交界区域的世界野生动物保护旗舰物种，中俄两国间的合作对于野生东北虎、豹的种群恢复和繁衍意义重大。,"The cooperation between China and Russia is significant for the population restoration and reproduction of manchurian tigers and Northeastern leopards, which are flagship species for the wild animal protection in the Sino-Russia boundary area,."
3105,据吉林省林业厅介绍，此前吉林省已与俄罗斯建立了长期稳定的合作交流机制。,"According to Jilin Provincial Forestry Department, Jilin Provincial government has established long-term stable cooperation and exchange mechanism with Russian government."
3106,在11日结束的2016中国珲春虎豹保护国际论坛上，中俄两国林业部门和动物保护组织再次达成多项共识。,"At the 2016 China Hunchun Tiger and Leopard Protection International Forum which was terminated on September 11th, the forestry department and animal protection organization of China and Russia reached several consensuses for the second time."
3107,吉林省林业厅表示，加强中俄两国虎、豹保护合作，不仅是中国东北虎、豹保护面临的十分紧迫的任务，也是维系俄罗斯虎、豹种群健康的当务之急。,"According to the Jilin Provincial Forestry Department, the cooperation on enhancing the protection of tigers and leopards of China and Russia is not only quite pressing task for the protection of manchurian tigers and Northeastern leopards, but also a priority to maintain the population health of tigers and leopards of Russia."
3108,孙福坚身为党员领导干部，理想信念丧失，严重违反党的纪律，且党的十八大后仍不收敛、不收手、顶风违纪，性质恶劣、情节严重。,"Sun Fujian is a Party cadre, but he lost his ideal and belief by violently breaking the discipline of the Party after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. In addition, he is not astringent and breaks the rules. Such deed is vile and grave indeed."
3109,此案件发生后，经多家媒体报道后，成为焦点案件，社会影响极坏。,"After the occurrence of this case and a number of media reports, this has become the focus of the case, with extremely bad social impact."
3110,案件发生后，海口市公安局刑警支队领导高度重视，立即组织支队一大队精干警力主动出击展开侦查。,"After the case, Haikou City Public Security Bureau of Interpol detachment leaders attach great importance and immediately organize a detachment of elite troops to take the initiative to investigate."
3111,警方立即将该嫌疑人执行上网追逃，采取多种措施布控，并通过联系外地警方协查王某国的下落。,"The police immediately pursued and attacked the suspect on the internet and took a variety of measures to control. In addition, the police contacted their colleagues of other cities to investigate the whereabouts of Wang."
3112,由于该嫌疑人系盗窃惯犯，屡次被公安机关打击处理过，具有较强的反侦察能力，加上他长期吸毒，讯问中毒瘾时常发作，审讯工作非常困难。,"As the suspect is a stealing recidivism and repeatedly dealt with by the public security organs, he has strong anti-reconnaissance capabilities. In addition, due to his long-term drug abuse, the often drug addiction makes trial work quite difficult."
3113,格陵兰鲨又称小头睡鲨，广泛分布于格陵兰岛与冰岛周围的北大西洋海域，其在成年时所达到的身长为4至5米。,"Greenland sharks are also known as small head sleeping sharks, widely distributed in Greenland and the North Atlantic waters around Iceland. It has the length of 4 to 5 meters in their adult age."
3114,但它们的生长速度极其缓慢，有时1年只长约1厘米，这提示格陵兰鲨可能有着格外长的寿命。,"But their growth rate is extremely slow, sometimes only about 1 cm a year, suggesting that Greenland shark may have an extra-long life."
3115,传统的测年方法通常使用动物的钙化组织，一些鲨鱼中可以使用鳍脊，但这种钙化组织在格陵兰鲨中十分稀少。,"Traditional dating methods usually use calcified tissue of animals. Some fins can use fins, but this calcified tissue is very scarce in Greenland sharks."
3116,由丹麦哥本哈根大学的尤利乌斯·尼尔森领导的新研究转而使用格陵兰鲨的眼部晶状体进行放射性碳测年。,"A new study led by Julius Nelson of the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, turned to the use of Greenland shark's ocular lens for radioactive carbon dating."
3117,这种方法此前曾用于测定鲸鱼的年龄，但用来确定鲨鱼等鱼类的年龄还是第一次。,"This method had previously been used to determine the age of whales, but it is the first time to be used to determine the age of sharks and other fish."
3118,他们的分析显示，这头最大的鲨鱼寿命估计为392岁，误差为120岁。,"Their analysis showed that the life span of the largest shark is estimated at 392 years old, with the error of 120 years old."
3119,这就是说，这条鲨鱼年龄至少是272岁，最大可能达到512岁。,"That is to say, this shark is aged at least 272 years old. The maximum age may be 512 years old."
3120,此外，雌性的格陵兰鲨据称要到身长约4米时才能性成熟，换算成年龄也就是至少要到156岁才成年。,"In addition, the female Greenland shark is alleged to be sexually matured at about 4 meters in length. That is, it can only reach adulthood at least until the age of 156."
3121,研究人员因此在论文中写道，格陵兰鲨是地球上已知的、最长寿的脊椎动物，超过了以前的长寿冠军露脊鲸（211岁）。,"The researchers thus wrote in the paper that the Greenland shark was known as the vertebrate with the longest life span on the Earth, surpassing the age of the previous longevity champion black right whale (211 years)."
3122,一年以来，汇改成果显著，人民币汇率保持基本稳定，同时也为推动人民币国际化奠定了基础。,"Over the past year, the exchange reform results are significant, with RMB exchange rate remaining basically stable, but also laying foundation for promoting the internationalization of the RMB."
3123,从市场表现来看，一年来，人民币汇率双向浮动特征明显，汇率弹性增强，汇率预期总体平稳。,"From the point of market performance, over the past year, the two-way floating characteristics of RMB exchange rate is outstanding. The elasticity of exchange is expected to be strengthened and the exchange rate is expected to be generally stable."
3124,汇改至今，人民币对美元中间价超百点的上下波动屡屡出现，但过程升贬交替。,"Ever since the exchange reform, the fluctuation of RMB against the US dollar often appears, with ups and downs during the process."
3125,去年“8·11”汇改之前的最后一次汇改措施实施于2005年，十年间人民币对美元显著升值。,"Last year, the last remittance measure before ""8.11"" exchange reform was carried out in 2005. The appreciation of yuan against dollar was significant during the last 10 years."
3126,新汇改实施以来，人民币改变了之前升值状态，一年间人民币汇率中间价贬值约8％。,"Since the implementation of the new exchange reform, the previous appreciation state of RMB was changed. The central parity rate of RMB exchange rate in one year was about 8%."
3127,今年10月1日，国际货币基金组织将正式接纳人民币，成为ＳＤＲ（特别提款权）权重货币。,"This October 1, the International Monetary Fund will officially accept the yuan, which will become SDR weight currency."
3128,本周，中国海关总署公布的统计数据显示，今年前7个月，中国进出口总值13.21万亿元人民币，比去年同期下降3％。,"This week, China's General Administration of Customs released statistics show that the first 7 months of this year, China's import and export value of 13.21 trillion yuan, down 3% over the same period last year."
3129,而在7月当月，中国进出口总值同比仅下降0.9％，特别是出口同比增长了2.9％。,"In July, China's total import and export value fell by only 0.9% year on year. In particular, China's export value had a year-on-year rise of 2.9%."
3130,相关专家认为，尽管7月进出口有企稳迹象，但不应有过高预期。,"Relevant experts believed that despite the signs of stabilization in July, we should not have high expectations."
3131,7月，中国进出口总值2.09万亿元人民币，同比下降0.9％。,"In July, China's total import and export valued 2.09 trillion yuan, a year-on-year fall of 0.9%."
3132,其中，出口1.22万亿元人民币，增长2.9％；进口8730亿元人民币，下降5.7％；贸易顺差3428亿元，扩大34％。,"Among them, the export was valued 1.22 trillion yuan, up 2.9%; the import was valued 873 billion yuan, down 5.7%; trade surplus was valued 342.8 billion yuan, an increase of 34%."
3133,尽管进出口总值同比依然下降，但出口数据出现了增长，这也是自今年3月以来，出口实现连续第五个月增长。,"Although the total value of imports and exports fell year on year, the export data enjoyed growth. This is the fifth consecutive month for export to achieve growth since March this year."
3134,上海警方4个月擒贼3400余人打击“盗抢骗”团伙157个,"Shanghai police captured more than 3,400 thieves and combated 157 ""robbery fraud"" gangs in 4 months"
3135,在侦破案件的同时，警方还追缴赃款赃物合计人民币3300余万元。,"While detecting the case at the same time, the police also pressed for payments and recovered stolen goods totaling more than 33 million yuan."
3136,据盗窃团伙成员供述，他们通过包乘黑车方式从外地进入上海，随后分别下车作案，数小时后各自会合上车，再一同离沪。,"According to the theft gang members, they came to Shanghai in the way of chartering unlicensed taxi. Then they came down the taxi and gathered and took taxi several hours later. Finally, they left Shanghai together."
3137,作案过程中犯罪嫌疑人往往以一幢楼为单位，采用外墙攀爬，撬断防盗窗栅栏的方式从上至下“扫楼式”盗窃。,"During the crime offence period, the criminal suspects swept the floor for theft from top to below by climbing the external wall and breaking the window fence."
3138,日前，该涉案犯罪嫌疑人已被徐汇公安分局移送徐汇区检察院审查起诉。,"Recently, the suspect involved was transferred by Xuhui Public Security Bureau to Xuhui District Procuratorate for prosecution."
3139,警方提醒广大市民群众，外出时务必锁好家中门窗，对于防盗窗的选择，建议市民群众应当选择材质较硬的钢材。,"Police reminded the general public to lock the doors and windows before going out. In addition, citizens are recommended to choose the relatively hard steel material for anti-theft window."
3140,据中国之声《新闻晚高峰》报道，8月下旬，日本首相安倍晋三将赴肯尼亚出席第六届非洲开发会议。,"In late August, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will go to Kenya to attend the 6th African Development Conference, according to the Evening News Peak of Voice of China."
3141,非洲开发会议由日本主导，此前的五次会议均是在日本东京或者横滨举行，因此，本次会议也将是首次移师非洲。,"The African Development Conference was dominated by Japan, and the previous five meetings were held in Tokyo, Japan or Yokohama, so this meeting will be the first move to Africa."
3142,日本外务省官员就此表示，在非洲当地召开会议有助于引起非洲和欧洲各国对日本的关注。,Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said the meeting held in Africa will help to attract attentions of African and European countries to Japan.
3143,为了配合安倍晋三的此次出访，据共同社消息，日本自民党将向相关各国派遣议员团。,"In line with the trip of Shinzo Abe, according to Kyodo news agency, the Japanese Liberal Democrats will send parliamentary groups to the countries concerned."
3144,日本“入常”之路始于上世纪90年代初，而由日本发起的非洲开发会议同样始于1993年，这不是巧合！,"Japan's ""application to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council"" began in the early 90s of the last century while the African-sponsored African Development Conference also began in 1993. This is not a coincidence."
3145,非洲在联合国拥有53个席位，是联合国的重要票仓，日本要想“入常”，又怎么会舍弃非洲？,Africa has 53 seats in the United Nations and is therefore an important ticket bunker of the United Nation. How can Japan give up Africa if it wanted to join the United Nations Security Council?
3146,还将与各国相关人士就极端组织“伊斯兰国”及恐怖活动对策交换意见。,"It will also exchange views with national stakeholders on the extreme organization of ""Islamic State"" and terrorist activities."
3147,“西部组”将访问塞拉利昂、利比里亚、几内亚比绍等7个国家。,"""Western Group"" will visit seven countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea Bissau."
3148,日本外相岸田文雄近来也在联合国安理会上就此次非洲开发会议说明了意图。,"Fumio Kishida, the current Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan has also recently stated the intentions of the African Development Conference at the UN Security Council."
3149,安倍曾在此间宣布，为了撒哈拉沙漠以南非洲国家的稳定，将在5年内提供1000亿日元（约合人民币61亿元）的援助。,"Abe has announced here that in order to stabilize the stability of sub-Saharan African countries, it will provide 100 billion yen (about RMB 6.1 billion) in five years."
3150,观察人士普遍认为，一直以来，日本对非洲的慷慨主要有两个目的：一是增加日本在非洲的存在感；二是争取在入常问题上赢得非洲国家的支持。,"Observers generally believe that there are two purposes behind Japan's generosity toward Africa: first, to increase Japan's presence in Africa; second, to win the support of African countries on the application to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council."
3151,日本问题专家杨伯江分析称，“从政治方面，非洲虽然相对发展滞后，但是国家数量比较多，所以日本一向把它视为所谓的‘大票田’。”,"""In terms of politics, Africa is relatively lagging behind, but there are many African countries. So Japan has always regarded it as the so-called 'big ticket field,'"" said Yang Bojiang, an expert for Japanese issues."
3152,今后日本是不会放弃的，对于非洲的工作也不会就此终止，会不断加强。,Japan will not give up in the future and its work on Africa will not be terminated but gradually strengthened.
3153,经济方面，因为日本的生产能力比较强，但是国内市场相对有限，特别是目前在少子老龄化背景下，内需相对比较低迷。,"Economically, Japan enjoys a strong production capacity, but its domestic market is relatively limited. In particular, the domestic demand is relatively weak in the context of aging population."
3154,不过，从10年前的小泉纯一郎，到10年后的安倍，其间，日本曾多次发起的入常“冲刺”，却均铩羽而归。,"However, from Junichiro Koizumi, who was Japan's prime minister 10 years ago, to the present Abe, Japan has repeatedly launched the ""sprint"" scheme. However, all schemes were abandoned eventually."
3155,日本问题专家杨伯江认为，日本入常意图一目了然，但入常之路势必困难重重。,"Yang Bojiang believed that the intension of Japan to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council is be clear at a glance. However, the road is bound to be full of obstacles."
3156,日本要实现自己的目标，首先要和周边国家搞好关系，其中，无论在地缘政治争夺还是在民族争端以及历史认识问题上，日本需要有一个正确的态度。,"To achieve its own goals, Japan should firstly do a good job with the surrounding countries. And Japan needs to have a correct attitude no matter in geopolitical competition or in the national dispute or understanding of a historical problem."

3178,本次活动总统筹胡炎松表示，“我们不想把盂兰文化节布置得很恐怖，让人不敢接近，特别是小孩子。”,"""We do not want to make the Bon Culture Festival very horrifying, which may spook people, especially the children,"" said Hu Yansong, the chief responsible person of the event."

3181,据了解，香港潮人盂兰胜会已于2011年列入“国家级非物质文化遗产名录”。,"It is understood that the Federation of Hong Kong Chiu Chow Community Organizations is listed as ""national intangible cultural heritage list"" in 2011."
3182,１１日晚，中国国家京剧院携名剧《白蛇传》穿越千里来到墨西哥城，在墨国家美术宫为当地民众呈现了一场原汁原味的京剧盛宴。,"On the evening of the 11th day of the month, China National Peking Opera Theater took its famous TV play ""White Snake"" and traveled thousands of miles to Mexico City. They presented the local people with an authentic Peking Opera feast in the Mexican National Palace."
3183,作为“中拉文化交流年”重点演出项目，８月９日至２３日，中国国家京剧院在墨西哥首都墨西哥城以及科尔多瓦、华雷斯等５座城市演出７场京剧。,"As the key performance project of ""Sino-Latin American Cultural Exchange Year"", from August 9 to 23, China National Peking Opera Theater performed seven opera in the Mexican capital Mexico City and Córdoba, Juarez and other five cities."
3184,观众们跟着《白蛇传》情节的起承转合、演员的唱念做打，时而会心微笑，时而热烈鼓掌。,"The audience sometimes smiled and sometimes applauded for the changing and concluding of the ""White Snake"" episode and the actor's singing."
3185,１５年前曾观看过京剧演出的玛丽萨·希门尼斯·卡乔陪着女儿看完演出。,I watched the performance of Marissa Jimenez Kachie accompanying her daughter in the Peking opera performance 15 years ago.
3186,“这是一场精彩绝伦的表演，音乐、灯光、舞台表演都让我印象深刻，……我觉得很有必要让女儿也来了解中国文化和中国京剧艺术。”,"""This is a fantastic performance. Its music, lighting and stage performances are impressive to me ... ... I think it is necessary to let her daughter understand the Chinese culture and Chinese opera art."""

3191,刘赐贵赴三亚调研“双修、双城”要求提升城市建管水平,"Liu Cigui came to Sanya for the research of ""Double Restoration and Dual City"" and required to enhance the level of urban construction and management"
3192,12日上午，刘赐贵主持召开座谈会，听取了三亚市“双修”“双城”试点工作推进情况的汇报及各有关部门的意见建议。,"In the morning of 12th day of the month, Liu Cigui presided over a symposium, listened to the report of the progress of the pilot project of ""Double Restoration and Dual City"" and the suggestions and comments of the relevant departments."
3193,刘赐贵对试点工作中取得的阶段性成果和创造出的好经验、好做法给予充分肯定。,Liu Cigui provided fully affirmation for the stage results and good experiences and practice.
3194,刘赐贵强调，三亚要紧紧抓住历史发展机遇，以“双修”“双城”试点工作为重要抓手，在全省经济社会发展中充分发挥好示范带动的龙头作用。,"Liu Cigui stressed that Sanya should firmly grasp the historical development opportunities and take the pilot work of ""Double Restoration and Dual City"" as key content to give full play to the leading role of demonstration during the economic and social development in order to firmly grasp historical development opportunities."

3199,邓亚萍在14年的运动生涯中，共拿到18个世界冠军，成为中国奥运历史上第一个夺得四枚奥运金牌的人。,"In the 14 years of her sports career, Deng Yaping won a total of 18 world championships, becoming the first Chinese to win four Olympic gold medals in China's Olympic history."
3200,她在乒坛排名连续8年保持世界第一，是乒乓球史上排名“世界第一”时间最长的女运动员。,"She ranked first in the table tennis for 8 years to maintain the world's first and is a female athlete to rank as the ""the world's first"" for the longest time in the history of table tennis."
3201,2010年9月26日，任人民日报社副秘书长兼人民搜索网络股份公司总经理，正厅级干部。,"On September 26, 2010, she served as Deputy Secretary-General of People's Daily, general manager of People's Search Network Co., Ltd. and the department-level cadre."
3202,日前，她将和俞敏洪联手共同打造国内第一家体育产业创新创业平台。,"Recently, she will work together with Yu Minhong to build the first domestic sports industry innovation and entrepreneurship platform."
3203,中国体坛上也有这样一群明星教练：他们在运动员时代风光无限，为国家赢得无数荣耀；退役后将多年所学传授于后来者，培养出中夺冠军。,"There was also a team of star coaches in the Chinese sports circle. They were gorgeous in the era of athletes and won countless glory for the country. After retirement, they passed what they learned to the new comers and cultivated a great number of champions."
3204,作为中国男子体操首位世界冠军，黄玉斌退役后选择拿起教鞭。,"As the first world champion in Chinese men's gymnastics, Huang Yubin chose to pick up the pointer after retirement."
3205,从女队教练到男队教练，再到总教练，黄玉斌打造了一支“奥运金团”，更率队在北京奥运会取得了9金1银4铜的神话战绩。,"From the women's team coach to the men's team coach, to the head coach, Huang Yubin created an ""Olympic gold group"", and led to win 9 gold, 1 silver and 4 copper at the Beijing Olympic Games."
3206,此后，田亮一直广告代言不断，更是在近年扮演了“牛郎”、“雷锋”等重要角色。,"Since then, Tian Liang has been experiencing advertising endorsement. He has even served as a ""Cowherd"", ""Lei Feng"" and other important roles in recent years."
3207,很多NBA球员都证明了自己的实力。但是有人进步就有人衰落。,"Many NBA players have proved their strength. But whenever there is progress, there is decline."
3208,无论是因为年龄的增大还是出场时间被限制，每个赛季都有一些球员的表现会出现退步。,"Whether it is because of the increase in age or limited playing time, some players will have regressive performance each season."
3209,当然了，有些“退步”可能仅仅是数据的缩水，这些球员的实力可能并未下降。,"Of course, some ""retreat"" may only be data shrink, but the strength of these players may not have been reduced."
3210,即便韦德仍是联盟里最好的得分后卫之一，但是他在公牛的表现应该不会有热火那么好了。,"Even if Wade is still one of the league's best linebacker, his performance in the Bulls is not so good as that of the Heat."
3211,他和隆多组成的后场射程有限，当家球星巴特勒的三分命中率也只有32.8%，这让他们下赛季的进攻会打得很拥挤。,"The backcourt range of he and Londo is limited. The three-point hit rate of headed star Butler is just 32.8%, making their next-season offence quite challenging."
3212,来到了风城，闪电侠势必把球权更多地让给巴特勒和隆多，自己很可能在常规赛选择养生打法。,"After coming to Feng Cheng, the Red Star will definitely give the ball right to Butler and Rondo and he himself choose to play healthy in the regular season."
3213,奥卡福的情况比较尴尬，作为上赛季76人的第一选择，他在新赛季不得不和西蒙斯以及恩比德竞争上场时间和球权。,"Okafor's situation is more embarrassing. As the first choice of 76 people last season, he had to compete for playing time and ball right with Simmons and Enby in the new season."
3214,这一竞争可能不会来的很快，西蒙斯还需要适应NBA赛场，恩比德也要尽快从伤病中完全恢复，但是奥卡福能否在76人的长人阵中有位置还是个问题。,"This competition may not come soon. Simmons also need to adapt to the NBA stadium, and Enbi must also be fully recovered from the injury as soon as possible, but whether Okafor can have a position in the long array of 76 people."
3215,上个赛季，奥卡福32%的得分来自低位进攻，这一比例高于考辛斯、武切维奇和布鲁克·洛佩斯，同时他的使用率也高居联盟前40。,"Last season, 32% of the score of Okafor comes from the low attack. Such rate is higher than Cousins, Wuchevich and Brook Lopez, while his use rate is also the top 40 in the league."
3216,随着西蒙斯已经展现了出色的控球前锋潜质，恩比德也拥有着更适合NBA比赛的身材，奥卡福的地位恐怕很难再那么稳固了。,"With Simmons already showing a good point-forward potention, Enbi also has a better stature more suitable for NBA games and Okafor's position is hard to be so solid."
3217,过去两个赛季，汤普森的使用率已经稳定在了联盟前20，而这也是他生涯最出色的两个赛季。,"Over the past two seasons, Thompson's use rate has stabilized in the top 20 of the league and this is the best two seasons for his career."
3218,不过问题是，随着杜兰特的到来，汤普森的使用率一定会下降，这势必将影响他的发挥。,"But the problem is, with the arrival of Durant, Thompson's appearance ratio will surely decline, which is bound to affect his play."
3219,这一影响将不仅是出手次数的影响，汤神的持球进攻在下赛季肯定也会大大减少，这在某些方面也会降低对手对他的防守难度。,"This effect will not only be the impact of the number of shots, Thompson's holding attack in the next season will certainly be greatly reduced, which in some ways will reduce the opponent's defense difficulty."
3220,杜兰特的到来一定会让勇士队的球员们数据缩水，但这其中缩水最严重的恐怕就是汤普森了。,"Durant's arrival will certainly negatively affect the score of Warriors players, but the one with the most negative effect is probably that of Thompson."
3221,但这并不意味着汤神的水平退步，这更像是他为球队整体做出了牺牲。,But this does not mean that the level of Thompson steps backward. This is more likely that he made sacrifice for the team as a whole.
3222,帕克在上个赛季表现得比数据反映的要好些，不仅是因为他的篮下效率来到了生涯最高，他和阿尔德里奇的化学反应也让马刺队受益。,"Parker had a better performance than last season. This is not only because his basket efficiency came to the highest level, his chemical reaction with Aldrich also benefits the Spurs."
3223,邓肯退役，吉诺比利宣布再战一年，GDP的组合最终也走到了尽头，作为三个人里最年轻的一个，法国跑车的油箱里也没有多少油了。,"Duncan retired, Ginobili announced a second battles for a year and the combination of GDP eventually came to an end. As one of the youngest among three people, the oil tank of French sports car is not much left."
3224,在得到了第三枚总冠军戒指之后，只有贾巴尔、乔丹和拉塞尔比詹姆斯赢得了更多的常规赛MVP，而乔丹是唯一一个FMVP比詹姆斯多的人。,"After getting the third championship ring, only Jabbar, Jordan and Russell won more regular MVP than that of James, while Jordan was the only one who had more FMVP than that of James."
3225,哦，对了，詹姆斯刚刚为克利夫兰带来了过去52年里第一座职业体育冠军奖杯。,"Oh, yes, James has just brought the first professional sports championship trophy in Cleveland in the past 52 years."
3226,来到了职业生涯第14个赛季的詹姆斯需要更好的保证体力，为季后赛做好准备。,"Coming to the 14th season of his career, James needs to better conserve his strength and get ready for the playoffs."
3227,因此，在常规赛里，詹姆斯的数据很可能进一步下滑，他会把更多的重担分给欧文来承担，不过他仍然会轻松地成为联盟前三的球员。,"Therefore, in the regular season, James's capability is likely to further decline, he will give more weight to Owen to bear, but he will still easily become the league's top three players."
3228,“一定要把从国内学到的才艺在俄罗斯发扬开来”。,"""I must carry forward what I learned in China to apply to Russia""."
3229,当地时间12日，莫斯科华侨华人联合会主席黄静在看到中新网记者时激动的说道。,"On the 12th day of the month of the local time, Huang Jing, chairman of the Moscow Overseas Chinese Association said excitedly while she saw the reporter of Chinanews.com."
3230,前不久，她在国内参加了由中国国务院侨务办公室主办、暨南大学承办的“海外华人文化社团中华才艺(书法、绘画)培训班”。,"Not long ago, she participated in the ""overseas Chinese culture community Chinese talent (calligraphy, painting) training"" hosted by Chinese State Council Overseas Chinese Affairs Office and sponsored by Jinan University."
3231,刚刚参加培训班时，自己对于书画完全不知道从哪里下手，结果在培训班结束后，已经能画出和写出自己的作品。,"While participating in the training course just now, she did not know where to start in painting and calligraphy. As a result, after the end of the course, she has been able to draw and write her own works."
3232,自己回莫斯科后，一定要用所学到的知识和技能，为中华文化的传播和弘扬作出自己的贡献。,"After returning back to Moscow, I will use the knowledge and skills learned in China to Russia and make my own contribution for the cultural transmission and promotion of the Chinese culture."
3233,同时参加这一培训班的俄罗斯中华文化促进会秘书长那延伟也有相同感觉。,"At the same time, Na Yanwei, the Secretary-General of Russian-Chinese Culture Promotion Association who also participated in this training course had the same feeling."
3234,她说，自己在培训班老师的帮助下进步非常大，同时也感受到了作为“中华文化海外传播者”的重任。,"She said that she made great progress with the help of teachers of the training classes and she felt the heavy responsibility of being the ""overseas communicator of Chinese culture"""
3235,那延伟说，自己回俄后定要把中华传统文化在华人和热爱中国文化的俄罗斯人中间传播和弘扬下去。,"She said, after she came back to Russia, she would surely carry out the traditional Chinese culture among the Chinese and the Russians who love Chinese culture."
3236,今日19点35分，在中超第22轮率先开打的一场比赛中，重庆力帆客场挑战北京国安。,"At 19:35 today, in one match of the 22nd round of Chinese Football Association Super League, Chongqing Lifan Football Club challenged Beijing Guoan Talent Football Club in the visiting field."

3244,这也是卡尔德克在中超首发的赛事中就取得入球，力帆2:0领先。,This is also the time for Alan Kardec to score in the initial games of Chinese Football Association Super League. Lifan leads in 2:0.
3245,下半场刚刚开场费尔南多就以强行突破赢得右侧任意球，可惜小角度攻门打高。,"Just in the beginning of the next half, Fernando won any score on the right side by breaking off. It is a pity that he lobbed in small angle."
3246,在邓小飞被判定拖延时间领到黄牌后，替补出场的彭欣力因禁区前犯规也领到黄牌。,"After Deng Xiaofei received a yellow card in the delaying time, Peng Xinli who is alternative also received a yellow card because he fouled in front of the penalty area."

3262,英国队在七人制橄榄球赛中获得银牌，斐济队夺得金牌,Britain settle for silver in rugby sevens after Fiji masterclass sees them take gold
3263,在周四晚上的七人制橄榄球赛决赛中，英国队未能在斐济队面前延续之前的出色表现，被斐济队以43比7在里约蒂奥多罗体育场击败。,Great Britain's impressive run in the Rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
3264,斐济队凭借在控球、抢断、回避、配合、跑动和力量方面无懈可击的表现夺得金牌，这也是该国有史以来的首块奥运会奖牌。,"Fiji gave a masterclass in handling, off-loading, side-stepping, support play, running lines and brute strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour."
3265,银牌对于被击败的英国队而言也算是一个不小的安慰，这块银牌是英国代表团当天获得的第三块银牌。这一成绩足以让英国橄榄球队感到骄傲：他们在首次进入奥运会的七人制橄榄球赛上一路击败了新西兰、阿根廷和南非。,"Defeat came with the non-too shabby consolation of silver - Britain's third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural Olympic 7s tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way."
3266,当天早些时候，英国队以7比5险胜南非队，这可能影响了他们在决赛中状态。,"The bruising beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, may have come back to bite them in the final."
3267,但无论如何，现在的斐济队足以击败一支精神饱满的15人球队。,"But, regardless, Fiji on this form would have beaten a fit as a fiddle 15-man team."
3268,明天，至少有一个英国人将戴上一块金牌，这对于英国队而言可能是一种安慰，但也可能不是。这个英国人就是来自温布尔顿的斐济队主教练本·瑞恩，他曾担任英国队的主教练。,"It may be some consolation to GB - but probably not - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach is Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon."
3269,英国队能取得今天的成绩实属不易。,It has been some journey for GB.
3270,八年前，在瑞恩的执教下，他们在阿德莱得国际七人制橄榄球赛上未尝胜果。,"Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens."
3271,而现在，他们离冠军仅一步之遥。,"Here, they lost just one."
3272,虽然他们受到了巨大的打击，但也取得了十分惊人的进步。,This hammering will hurt but the progress is startling.
3273,斐济开场就占据优势，使英国队毫无招架之力。,"Fiji started magnificently, bouncing off GB tackles for fun."
3274,对于汤姆·米切尔和他的队友而言，这就像撞上了一连串正在行驶的公共汽车。当欧西·科林尼索冲入角旗区时，这支世界系列赛冠军球队已经以5比0的比分遥遥领先了。,It was like running into a series of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and co and the World Series champions went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau dived over in the corner.
3275,比赛仅仅过了四分钟，杰瑞·图怀又在右翼触地得分。,"With four minutes on the clock Jerry Tuwai added another down the right wing, which was converted."
3276,12比0，英国队几乎没有碰到过球。,12-0 and GB had hardly touched the ball.
3277,米切尔的强力阻截让巨人一般的里昂•那卡拉瓦没有第三次得分，但这仅仅是延缓了斐济得分的速度。,A superb Mitchell tackle stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third but it was only delaying Fiji.
3278,在7分钟时，亚萨·卫莱马鲁在右角触地。17比0，英国队雪上加霜。,On seven minutes Jasa Veremalua touched down in the right corner and GB were 17-0 to the bad.
3279,那卡拉瓦又得一分，而比赛……的上半场还剩1分钟。,Nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half.
3280,然后，瓦特莫·拉沃沃冲破英国队的防守，直达得分线。,Vatemo Ravouvou then burst through some more limp GB tackling and stormed to the line to score.
3281,中场休息时，比分已经是29比0。,The conversion made it 29-0 at the break.
3282,斐济人就好像生来就是打7人制橄榄球的，而英国队仍是初出茅庐。,"It was as if Fiji had been born to play 7s, while GB are still learning the trade."
3283,情况就是这样。,Which is pretty much how it is.
3284,英国队在下半场作出了巨大的改变并且在整整四分钟里冲击着斐济人的防线，就上半场而言，这一表现已经很好了。但之后斐济队打出精彩的配合，由乔舒亚·图埃索瓦再次得分。,"GB made wholesale changes at half-time and they plugged the Fijian dam...for all of four minutes, which by first-half standards was good, until Josua Tuisova went over after some brilliant Fijian interplay."
3285,丹·诺顿为英国队创造了得分的机会，他在左角触地，将比分更改为36比7，但比赛早已在南海岛国的掌控中，他们的球迷在站台上高声歌唱、挥舞旗帜、载歌载舞。,"Dan Norton grabbed a try for GB, touching down in the left corner to make it 36-7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands."
3286,斐济队的精彩表现令人不得不拍手称快。,It was hard not to admire Fiji's whole joyful approach.
3287,马塔·威廉在最后时刻阻止了斐济队的一次无所谓的进攻。,Mata Viliame iced the Fijian cake that didn't need icing with another try in the dying moments.
3288,终场哨声响起，斐济人拥抱在一起，而完败的英国队只能遗憾退场。,"The whistle went, the Fijians embraced and GB hit the turf, thoroughly beaten."
3289,当天早些时候，斐济队在半决赛中以20比5击败了日本队，而英国对在一场激烈的半决赛对决中险胜南非队。,"Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in their semi-final and GB edged South Africa in a tight semi-final of one try each - Britain's conversion the difference."
3290,上半场凯尔·布朗帮助南非队取得领先，但丹·诺顿在下半场凭借出色的脚法破门得分。,Kyle Brown put the Boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton with some dazzling footwork broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half.
3291,之后，英格兰队安东尼的兄弟马库斯·沃森用精彩的拦截确保了球队的胜利，最终英国队夺得银牌。,"A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-aside team, Anthony, secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal."
3292,海伦·格拉芙和希瑟·斯坦宁受身患癌症的教练的鼓舞，夺得赛艇金牌,Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach's cancer battle
3293,毫不夸张地说，这是最让人感动的一块金牌。,"There will not be a more emotive gold at these games, and that is saying something."
3294,从第一次划桨开始到现在，海伦·格拉芙和希瑟·斯坦宁已接受了220次惩罚性拉举训练，而她们在 Estacio da Lagoa夺得的这块金牌具有更非凡的的意义。,"From the first stroke to the last, 220 punishing heaves into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."
3295,虽然划桨的只有她们两人，但船上还有一个人——教练罗宾·威廉姆斯——的声音一直陪伴着她们冲击连续第二块女子双人桨奥运会金牌，这是英国首对达到这一高度的赛艇女子组合。,"Though they were the two pulling on the oars, there were three voices in that boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams ever present as they powered to a second successive Olympic gold in the women's pairs, the first females in the annals of British sport to scale such a height."
3296,她们已保持了39场不败纪录，具有绝对的优势。,"Their dominance was absolute, after all this was their 39th outing unbeaten, again unprecedented."
3297,我们所看到的是这两名天才运动员在水面上优雅前行，但这并不是这一胜利的全部。,"What we see, two brilliant athletes skating over the surface with the elegance of swans, does not wholly reflect the nature of the triumph."
3298,在每一块赛艇金牌的背后都有许多自愿帮助的人，正是他们的不断奉献创造了不同，而其中帮助最大的莫过于一位30个月前得知自己身患癌症、不知道自己能否活着看到这一天的教练。,"Behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference, and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer."
3299,正如他所说，死亡随时可能到来。,"As he said, it was touch and go."
3300,我患上了膀胱癌，他们为我做了手术。,I had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did.
3301,如果不做手术的话，癌细胞会扩撒到全身。,If they don't it goes everywhere.
3302,这样，情况会糟糕得多。,It would have been a pretty bad situation.
3303,这会略微改变你的看法。,It alters your outlook a bit.
3304,威廉姆斯在2013年12月被确诊为癌症。,Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
3305,幸运的是，他在2014年年初开始了治疗，将影响降到最低，虽然在这种情况下这么说可能并不合适。,"The trio were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season, keeping the disruption to a minimum, if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these."
3306,我需要拿到工资，因此我必须赶快好起来。,I needed to get paid so I had to get better quickly.
3307,这对我来说是一种激励。,It was an incentive.
3308,我住在医院里，虽然他们说走几步就足够了，但我还是每次绕着病房走上20英尺、30英尺、50英尺。,"I was in hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20ft, 30ft 50ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough."
3309,这就是一切的起点。,That's how it starts off.
3310,赛艇运动本身是一次旅程，而这让这段旅程变得更长一点。,Rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger.
3311,在夺金的那一刻，她们首先想到的是威廉姆斯。今天早上的威廉姆斯比平时略微健谈一些，这是为了克服他的焦虑。,"In the immediacy of victory their first thoughts were for Williams, who had spent a nervy morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own anxieties."
3312,曾是皇家炮兵团队长的斯坦宁之后将前往阿富汗，她表示：“我这周的心情很不好，可能有点极端，但这块金牌的确意义非凡。”,"Stanning, a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment with a tour of Afghanistan behind her, said ""I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe that's a bit extreme, but it means such a lot."""
3313,它反复告诉我这对于我而言有多重要，我、海伦以及罗宾付出了多大的努力。,"It just reiterates how much this means to me, how much me and Helen have worked and Robin as well."
3314,这是海伦、罗宾和我努力了三年的回报。,It's been a fantastic three years back with Helen and Robin.
3315,如果没有罗宾，我们还只是无名小卒，非常感谢他，他是全世界最棒的教练。,"Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thanks to him he's the best coach in the world."
3316,我不可能找到比他更棒的训练师和教练。,"I couldn't have asked for a better person to train with, or a better coach."
3317,海伦·格拉芙和希瑟·斯坦宁在五年中未尝败绩。,Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
3318,这对组合所设置的惩罚力度是她们的对手所无法比拟的。,The pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never match.
3319,即便是在最后的500米，新西兰队和丹麦队开始逼近时，斯坦宁和格拉芙仍有大量的体能储备。,"Even in the final 500 metres when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve."
3320,当时真是惊心动魄。,We were very much in the moment.
3321,海伦叫着：“保持节奏、保持节奏”。,"Helen was calling 'stay in the process, stay in the process'."
3322,不被对手所影响的确非常重要。,It's really important not to get carried away.
3323,我们有一个很好的开始，同时我们并没有期盼着做什么惊天动地的大事。,We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do anything amazing.
3324,我们没有去想今天的荣耀，我们只是想着划好每一桨和赢得这场比赛，并且我们做到了。,"We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race, which we did."
3325,这对组合花了一年时间决定自己的未来。,The pair will take a year before deciding their futures.
3326,格拉芙下个月将与电视探险员史蒂夫·巴克沙尔结婚。,"Glover has a wedding to attend next month, her own to television adventurer Steve Backshall."
3327,不过现在，她只想享受当下。,For now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
3328,我不想说这是我的最后一场比赛。,I didn't want to say this was my last race.
3329,这会给我带来太大的压力。,That would have meant too much pressure.
3330,在伦敦，我用了约六个月时间才意识到我是奥运冠军。,In London it took about six months to realise that I was an Olympic champion.
3331,这是一种全新的体验，而我感到十分紧张。,It was all so new and I was so stressed.
3332,现在已过去了约4分钟。,Here it took about four minutes.
3333,她表示“我感觉好多了。”,"This feels so much better,"" she said."
3334,洛杉矶中央图书馆的惊艳结构先睹为快,A front-row seat to the stunning architecture of the Los Angeles Central Library
3335,美国建筑史学家学会南加利福尼亚洲分会与新书《洛杉矶中央博物馆：其艺术与建筑历史》的作者阿诺·斯瓦茨曼和史蒂芬·吉举办了一场沙龙。观众们可通过此次活动进一步了解市中心中央图书馆的历史。,"Learn more about the history of downtown's Central Library as the Society of Architectural Historians/Southern California Chapter hosts a salon with Arnold Schwartzman and Stephen Gee, authors of the new book ""Los Angeles Central Library: A History of its Art and Architecture"" ."
3336,吉和斯瓦茨曼将讨论并分享1926年贝特伦·古德西的设计图片以及1933年哈迪・霍尔兹曼・弗夫尔事务所的修复与扩建图片。,Gee and Schwartzman are scheduled to discuss and share images of the 1926 Bertram Goodhue design as well as the 1993 restoration and addition by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates.
3337,此次沙龙的时间为：8月21日下午2点至4点，地点：Salle Moderne，Art Deco Southwestern School of Law（前Bullocks Wilshire)，3050 Wilshire Blvd。,"The salon is set for 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. on Aug. 21 in the Salle Moderne at the Art Deco Southwestern School of Law, (formerly Bullocks Wilshire), 3050 Wilshire Blvd."
3338,参加者可以参观中央大厅、时代展室、仙人掌休息室和茶室。,"Attendees can tour the Central Hall, Period Rooms, Cactus Lounge and Tea Room."
3339,需要提前订票；SAHSCC会员：15美元；非会员：25美元。,"Advance tickets are required; SAH/SCC members, $15; non-members, $25."
3340,DTLA的开放式工厂阁楼进行了一次舒适的改造。,"An open, industrial loft in DTLA gets a cozy makeover"
3341,庆祝洛杉矶中央图书馆90周年以及新书的发售,Celebrating L.A.'s Central Library's 90th birthday with - what else? - a new book
3342,保加利亚8个月来首次出现通货膨胀,Bulgaria Posts Inflation for 1st Time in 8 Months
3343,国家统计结果表明，7月保加利亚的月通货膨胀率为1%。,"Inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July, national statistics show."
3344,这是几年来（自2012年6月起） 最高的通货膨胀率。去年10月 （通货膨胀率0.2%） 之后，通货膨胀率首次突破零点。,This is the highest value in years (since June 2012) and the first one above zero since October of last year when a positive 0.2% was posted.
3345,相比之前的12个月 （2014年8月至2015年7月），过去12个月 （2015年8月至2016年7月） 的年平均通货膨胀率 （以消费者价格指数衡量）为 -0.8%。,"The annual average inflation, measured by CPI, in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%."
3346,相比2016年6月，2016年7月的消费者价格指数为101.0%，即月通货膨胀率为 1.0%。,"The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%."
3347,今年至今的通货膨胀率 （2016年7月相对于2015年12月） 为 -0.2%。相比2015年7月，2016年7月的年通货膨胀率为 -0.2%。,The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) has been -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
3348,相比上月，下列几类消费品的价格在2016年7月出现上涨：食品和非酒精饮料 (1.7%)、交通 (1.8%)、娱乐与文化 (6.3%)、餐厅与酒店 (1.2%)、其他商品与服务 (0.3%)。,"In July 2016, compared to the previous month, an increase was observed in the price of the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); recreation and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%)."
3349,价格出现下降的有服装与鞋类 (2.2%)、家具、家电和常规维护 (0.5%)、医疗 (0.1%)。,"Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%); furnishings, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%)."
3350,与上月价格持平的有酒精饮料和烟草、住房、水、电、天然气和其他燃料、通信、教育。,"Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month in alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications; and education."
3351,Snapchat 的“动漫”效果被指讽刺亚洲人,"Snapchat ""Anime"" Effect Is Criticized as Asian Caricature"
3352,Snapchat表示这一滤镜的灵感来自动漫，但一些观察者认为它带有种族色彩。,"Snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racially insensitive."
3353,Snapchat的1.5亿名日常用户可以通过其滤镜工具改变现实并且将人像变得滑稽可笑。,"With its lens tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd."
3354,你可以把自己变成一颗菠萝、一只狗或一个罗伊·利希滕斯坦画中的角色。,"You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting."
3355,这些透镜具有钝化、弯曲特征的效果，每天产生3000多万张经过修饰的自拍。,"The lenses are blunt, feature-warping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day."
3356,任何失误都会立刻被公众所注意。,Any missteps quickly enter the public record.
3357,Snapchat透镜曾受到批评，该应用被指鼓动扮演黑人或者以白色皮肤为美。,Snapchat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting blackface or encouraging whitened skin tones as an ideal of beauty.
3358,因此，当该应用本周为一些用户提供了一个可以创造斜眼、怪牙和粉脸效果的滤镜时，一些评论家将其称为对亚洲“黄种人”的种族讽刺。,"So when it pushed a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes, distorted teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - ""yellowface."""
3359,他们甚至认为这些反复出现的问题是否意味着该公司在多样性上存在较大的问题。,And they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
3360,在Snapchat表示其删除该功能后，周三The Verge and Motherboard的报道引发众怒。,"The news and the outrage went wide on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had dismantled the feature."
3361,该公司的解释是：该滤镜是对动漫角色致敬，而非讽刺亚洲人。,"The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as homage to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people."
3362,但对于经历过种族主义的观察者而言，该滤镜让他们想起了现实中具有伤害性的刻板印象。,"But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens reminded them of hurtful stereotypes in action."
3363,其他人也坚决反对这些动漫形象。,Others roundly rejected the anime comparison.
3364,一名针对这些照片发表了推特并且被广泛分享的韩裔美国艺术生在一封电子邮件中表示，这些滤镜“至少是令人感到难受和不适的”。,"In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said that the lens was ""hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least."""
3365,她还表示：“很难区分极度恶心的亚洲讽刺形象与滤镜的效果。”,"She added that ""it's hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian caricature and the filter's effects."
3366,虽然滤镜中不只是黄种人，但黄种人被极端贬低。,"It shows that the filter isn't just yellowface, but yellowface taken to its derogatory extreme."
3367,Snapchat并不是唯一一家触及这些文化底线的公司。,Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires.
3368,从公司董事会到好莱坞以及我们携带的设备，美国文化似乎一直在提倡多样性与包容性。,"American culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands."
3369,Snapchat庞大的年轻群体由于比老一辈更加注重种族的多元化，因此可能会十分敏感。,And Snapchat's huge audience of younger people - who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensitivity.
3370,当Snapchat的一个滤镜产生了侮辱用户的形象时，25岁的朱凯蒂 （音译） 在周四的采访中表示：“相比以前，此类事物更难逃过人们的视线。”,"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, ""it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before."""
3371,周四，在Medium担任产品经理和工程师的朱女士决定删除她的Snapchat帐号并且鼓励他人也这么做。,"On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same."
3372,在一篇为Medium所写的文章和一次电话采访中，她表示自己认为种族方面的争议反映了Snapchat在招聘过程中缺乏种族多样性。,"In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that the race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat."
3373,朱女士批评该公司的员工大多数为白人，领导层全部为男性并且在文章的最后加上了一个标签：#DeleteSnapchat。,"Ms. Zhu criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat."
3374,作为一名华裔美国人，朱女士表示：“要么他们的员工中没有各色人种，所以才能作出这样的决定，要么他们的员工中有一些有色人种，但他们的职位无法让他们畅所欲言。”,"""It's either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where they're able to make decisions like this,"" Ms. Zhu, who is Chinese-American, said, ""or they do have some people of color who are working there, but they're not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up."""
3375,其他观察者分享了她没有被Snapchat回应的投诉。,"Other observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered."
3376,该公司并未发布有关员工多样性的数据，并且表示自己是一家私人公司。,"The company does not release figures about diversity on its staff, noting its status as a private company."
3377,周四，Snapchat拒绝讨论其员工的种族背景，但一名发言人称，该公司近期雇用了一名招聘人员专门负责关注内部比例较低的人群以及推动内部包容性方面的工作。,"On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally."
3378,朱女士表示，她将关闭她的 Snapchat 帐号：“我想知道他们是否需要更多像我们这样反对这一行为的用户。”,"For her part, Ms. Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, ""I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K."""
3379,国会小组表示，军事官员扭曲了ISIS的情报,"Military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence, Congressional Panel Says"
3380,一个国会小组在周四发布的报告中指出，美国中央司令部的官员更改了情报报告，将在伊拉克和叙利亚对抗伊斯兰国的战争情况描述得比实际情况更为乐观。,"Officials from the United States Central Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted, a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday."
3381,这份中期报告来自一个由众议院军事委员会、情报委员会和众议院拨款委员会国防分委会共和党主席组建的专项工作小组。报告称，中央司令部情报分析员存在“广泛的不满”，这些分析员表示上级正在篡改他们对于美国与伊斯兰国之战的评估。,"The interim report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found ""widespread dissatisfaction"" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State."
3382,位于佛罗里达州坦帕的中央司令部 (Centcom) 是负责监管美国在中东和中亚地区的军事行动的军事总部。,"Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia."
3383,根据一份关于该报告的新闻，“经过中央司令部高级领导者审核的情报对于美国反恐行动的描述比实际情况更乐观，并且始终比其他情报机构的分析更乐观。”,"""Intelligence products approved by senior Centcom leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community,"" a news release about the report said."
3384,加利福尼亚州共和党代表表示：“中央司令部的行为难以令人接受。一边是我们的战士饱受战争之苦，另一边则是高层政策制定者收到错误的分析。”,"""What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers,"" said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California."
3385,中央司令部的领导层问题已延伸到该机构的最高层。,The leadership failures at Centcom reach to the very top of the organization.
3386,该报告详细指出了2014年和2015年中央司令部在描述和分析美国培训伊拉克军队方面长期存在的问题。,The 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
3387,虽然没有确定性的证据表明，奥巴马政府的高层官员下令更改这些报告，但根据报告的描述，这些分析员感到自己受到了来自中央司令部领导者的压力，迫使他们对伊斯兰国 （ISIS或ISIL) 的威胁发表更乐观的意见。,"Although it offers no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doctored, it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."
3388,该报告称，“在2015年上半年，许多中央司令部的新闻稿、声明和国会证言比实际情况要乐观得多。”,"""Throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events,"" the report said."
3389,比如，一名中央司令部的官员公开表示可能最早在2015年4月或5月采取一次大型军事行动夺回摩苏尔。,"For example, a Centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015."
3390,伊拉克第二大城市摩苏尔目前仍在伊斯兰国的控制之下。,"Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State."
3391,堪萨斯州共和党代表迈克·蓬佩奥在一份声明中表示：“经过数月的调查，这一结果已十分明显。”,"""After months of investigation, this much is very clear,"" Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, said in a statement."
3392,自2014年中期到2015年中期，美国中央司令部的大部分高层情报官员操控了司令部的情报产品，隐瞒了伊拉克伊斯兰国的威胁。,"From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States Central Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq."
3393,共和党在从分析员那里得知有关伊斯兰国的情报被操控后，成立了一个专项工作小组。,Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
3394,随着调查的继续，继周四发布的这篇报告后将会有更多发现。,The report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues.
3395,国防部总检察长也对中央司令部进行了长期调查。,"There is an additional, ongoing investigation of Centcom intelligence by the Department of Defense inspector general."
3396,众议院情报委员会的民主党成员于周四公布了其调查结果，与共和党专项工作小组的部分结论相一致。,Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
3397,委员会民主党领袖代表谢安达在一份声明中表示：2014年至2015年期间，中央司令部针对伊斯兰国和伊拉克维和部队的情报评估制定了一项过于狭隘的流程。”,"""Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces,"" Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement."
3398,谢安达先生表示，该流程“妨碍了情报的发布”、降低了分析员的士气并且“无法接受不同的意见。”,"This process, Mr. Schiff said, ""stalled the release of intelligence products,"" hurt morale among analysts and ""insufficiently accommodated dissenting views."""
3399,但谢安达先生与民主党人还表示，他们未发现任何证据能够证明白宫试图给中央司令部的分析员施加压力，从而时他们的结论符合“预设或政治叙事。”,"But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a ""preset or political narrative."""
3400,《野兽日报》在周二报导了国会调查的初步结果。,The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
3401,去年八月，《纽约时报》报导了在收到中央司令部分析员的投诉后，五角大楼总检察长开始进行调查。,"Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts."
3402,五角大楼发言人海军少校帕特里克·埃文斯在一份声明中表示，在总检察长的调查未结束前，国防部不对这份国会报告发表任何评论。,"Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general's investigation continued."
3403,但他表示：“专家有时会对复杂数据的解读产生分歧，而情报机构和国防部鼓励就这些重要的国家安全主题进行健康的对话。”,"But he said that ""experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics."""
3404,此次调查的影响已超过了美国领导的在伊拉克和叙利亚的轰炸行动是否取得 （越来越多国防部官员所声称的) 成功这一问题。,The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials).
3405,但去年，这些主张使公众质疑奥巴马总统可以在多大程度上信任中央司令部所发布的伊拉克、阿富汗、利比亚和其他危机地区的军事行动评估。,"But last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots."
3406,有关伊斯兰国情报的批评令人想起出十多年前的争议，当时中央司令部情报分析员格雷戈里·胡克撰写了一篇研究文章，文中指出乔治·布什的政府不顾众多分析员的反对，坚持派遣小规模的部队前往伊拉克并且几乎没有考虑2003年入侵后的情况。,"The critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts"" objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion."
3407,胡克先生在此次关于伊斯兰国情报的反对活动中扮演了关键角色。,Mr. Hooker also played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence.
3408,去年，有官员表示，胡克先生的团队所得出的结论是针对伊斯兰国炼油厂的空袭并未大幅削减恐怖组织的经济收入，因为该恐怖组织建造了临时炼油厂继续在黑市上出售石油，而这与所公布的声明大相径庭。,"Last year, officials said, Mr. Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic State-held refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's finances because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market."
3409,根据《时代周刊》9月的报道，中央司令部未对外公布这一发现。,"But the finding was not distributed outside Central Command, The Times reported in September."
3410,当多名律师审阅了有关对于战争作出过度乐观评估的参议院证词后，中央司令部指挥官劳埃德·奥斯汀三世去年饱受批评。,"Centcom's commander then, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after Senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an overly positive assessment of the war."
3411,奥斯汀将军于4月退役，目前由约瑟夫·沃特尔接替他在中央司令部的职位。,General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
3412,美国在女子曲棍球赛中获得四连胜，将与英国一决胜负,"U.S. Wins 4th Straight in Women's Field Hockey, Setting Up Showdown With Britain"
3413,在6比1战胜日本的比赛中独中三元的凯蒂·巴姆于周四为美国女子曲棍球队率先梅开二度，帮助美国队以3比0战胜印度队。,"One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0."
3414,两场比赛五粒进球堪称技惊四座，但27岁的巴姆却表示她不知道自己有如此出色的表现。,"Five goals in two games should be a memorable feat, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing."
3415,她表示：“我对此一无所知。”,"""I have no clue,"" she said."
3416,我不是那种会记住自己进过几个球的人。,I'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
3417,她所知道的是美国队在奥运会上已取得四连胜并且将与小组中在周四以2比0战胜了日本队后未尝败绩的英国队争夺小组第一。,"Here is what she does know: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan, 2-0, on Thursday."
3418,英国和美国在周六第一轮最后一场比赛中狭路相逢。,Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
3419,两队均以晋级四分之一决赛，这场比赛将决定谁以小组第一的身份出现。,"Both teams have qualified for the quarter finals, and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second."
3420,取得小组第一的球队将避免遇到强大的荷兰队，从而能够走得更远。荷兰队以另一小组第一的身份出线。,"The first-place finisher will avoid the powerful Dutch, the leaders of the other bracket, for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin."
3421,在周六的比赛中，美国队以惊人的表现创造了奇迹。要知道在四年前的伦敦奥运会上，美国队在12支队伍中垫底。,"However Saturday's game turns out, the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here, four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the London Games."
3422,巴姆也在当时的那支队伍中。,Bam was on that team.
3423,巴姆成长于宾夕法尼亚州布鲁贝尔，在3岁时第一次拿起曲棍球棍 （她的双胞胎姐姐在德雷克塞尔从事这项运动）并且在16岁时加入国家队，成为了迄今为止最年轻的国家队成员。,"She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever."
3424,由于未能入选最终名单，她错过了2008年奥运会。,She missed out on the 2008 Olympics when she did not make the cut for the final roster.
3425,2012年，她和她的队友都不被看好。,"Then came 2012, when nothing much went right for her and her teammates."
3426,第二年，英国人克雷格·帕纳姆担任主教练，一切开始发生改变。,"The next year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was named the coach, and things began to change."
3427,巴姆表示：“这是一次文化、心态和实质上的改变。”,"""A cultural change, a mental change, a physical change,"" Bam said."
3428,我们当时在伦敦还未达到目前的水平。,We didn't have the work rate in London that we have now.
3429,我们来了一次彻彻底底的翻身。,We've made a complete turnaround.
3430,周四晚上，巴姆在上半场以一记近距离反手射门先拔头筹。,"On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close in."
3431,印度的在本届比赛中还未尝胜果，但这支队伍表现出了惊人的顽强斗志并且将1比0的比分保持到第三节快结束时，这时巴姆爆发了。,"India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third period, when Bam took charge."
3432,她带球沿球场左侧长途奔袭，随后内切到中路，抽射入网，美国队2比0领先。,"She made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field, then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead."
3433,梅利萨·冈萨雷斯在第四节中期射入最后一球。,Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period.
3434,美国对门将杰基·布里吉斯在本届比赛上首次零封对手，在前三场胜利中，对手各打入一球。,"The shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories."
3435,这次她是超常发挥。,She is on a roll.
3436,巴姆也是。,So is Bam.
3437,帕纳姆表示：“我们现在的状态很好”。但究竟有多好还要取决于周六比赛的结果。,"""We're in a good place right now,"" Parnham said, but just how good it is will depend on the result of Saturday's game."
3438,《丰盛大餐》中大萧条时期的寒酸食物,"The Depressing Food of the Depression, in ""A Square Meal"""
3439,1933年3月，刚刚当选为总统的富兰克林· 德拉诺·罗斯福坐在总统办公室里享用午餐。,"In March 1933, shortly after ascending to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office."
3440,作为一名美食家，罗斯福总统喜欢第五大道的美食，比如鹅肝酱和马里兰炖水鱼。,"A gourmand, President Roosevelt had a taste for fancy Fifth Avenue foods like pâté de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup."
3441,那天，他的菜单十分简单：番茄酱魔鬼蛋、土豆泥和作为点心的果脯布丁。,"His menu that day was more humble: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding."
3442,珍·齐格曼表示：“这是为了在食物上与正在受苦的人们同甘共苦。”,"""It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering,"" Jane Ziegelman said."
3443,她的丈夫安德鲁·科补充道：“这也体现了美国人的饮食方式。”,"Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, ""It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."""
3444,这对居住在布鲁克林高地的夫妻均为食品历史学家。,"The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians."
3445,科先生的上一本书《炒杂烩菜》是关于美国的中餐，而齐格曼女士在她的《97果园》一书中通过食物讲述了贫民区租客们的生活故事。,"Mr. Coe's last book, ""Chop Suey,"" was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book ""97 Orchard."""
3446,他们共同编写的新书《丰盛大餐》中将在周二由哈珀出版社出版，这本书介绍的是大萧条时期美国的食品历史。,"Their new, collaborative work, ""A Square Meal,"" which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food in the Great Depression."
3447,在展示了一些食物方面的共同见解后，他们在艾森博格的三明治店中遇到了一名记者。这个位于熨斗区的简单午餐柜台自1929年经济奔溃时起一直营业到现在。,"Showing some culinary solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929."
3448,54岁的齐格曼女士点了一份奶油芝士配碎橄榄三明治，而57岁的科先生点了火鸡、土豆泥和蔬菜拼盘。,"Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley."
3449,记者点了一份烘肉卷，这对夫妻认为这些菜适合讨论大萧条时期的饮食。,"When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating."
3450,齐格曼女士说：“当时面包非常流行。”,"""Loaves were very popular,"" Ms. Ziegelman said."
3451,当时有花生面包、肝脏面包、大豆面包。,"There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf."
3452,它们都用一种原料和一种能够浇在原料上的便宜浇头制成。,They were made from an ingredient and a cheap thing that stretches the ingredient out.
3453,想象一下，你的晚餐都是花生。,Imagine eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner.
3454,科先生扮了个怪相。,Mr. Coe grimaced.
3455,他说道：“它们在你的胃里肯定就像铅一样。”,"""It must have sat in your stomach like lead,"" he said."
3456,在大萧条发生前的几年，美国人顿顿都是自助餐，尤其是在郊区。,"In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet."
3457,一群女人为男农场工人们烧饭，早餐、午餐和晚餐都有刚考出来的馅饼。,"Teams of women cooked for male farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner."
3458,一战中，正是美国人将食物送给了饥饿的欧洲人。《丰盛大餐》记录了这个国家是如何突然不再成为一个富足之地。,"It was Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. ""A Square Meal"" chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty."
3459,科先生解释了为何他和他的妻子要写这本书：“当时，食物已成为令美国人感到不快的主要话题。”,"""This was a time when food became a central, fraught subject for the American people,"" Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it."
3460,另一个不愉快的话题是寒酸的新食物：面包和炖菜等“迷之食物”成为了主菜，炖菜是“最佳的剩菜烹饪方式”，齐格曼女士说道，这是因为厨师们可以使用酱料中的奶油掩盖难吃的食材。,"Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a ""wonderful way to repurpose leftovers,"" Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce."
3461,新鲜的水果被便宜的干果所代替。,Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
3462,多年来一直在美国人餐桌上担任主角的肉已变成了一种稀有的奢侈品。,"Meat, for years the center of the American meal, became a sparingly apportioned luxury."
3463,奇怪的大杂烩只考虑卡路里，比起味道、甚至是基本的烹饪常识，人们最先考虑的是营养。,Strange mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense.
3464,在研究本书，包括各种食谱的过程中，齐格曼女士制作了一份塞满花生油的烤洋葱。,"In researching the book, which includes recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter."
3465,科先生说道：“这在晚餐的餐桌上并不常见。”,"""It was not a popular addition to the dinner table,"" Mr. Coe said."
3466,齐格曼女士表示：“这也太奇怪了”。,"Ms. Ziegelman amplified: ""It was surreal."""
3467,花生油与烤洋葱根本无法搭配。,Peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion.
3468,这是许多家庭经济餐的特点。,It was characteristic of a lot of the home-ec recipes.
3469,家庭经济学家们影响着这个国家的饮食习惯，比如1923年至1943年担任联邦家庭经济局主厨的路易斯·斯坦利等人，这在历史上是绝无仅有的。,"As never before or since, home economists - among them Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits."
3470,他们在报纸和杂志中发布食谱和文章，鼓励女性“精打细算”并勇于将奶油意大利面配胡萝卜等糟糕的食物变成美食。,"Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become ""budgeteers"" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes."
3471,《丰盛大餐》是一顿丰盛的“历史珍味”。,"""A Square Meal"" is a feast of historical tidbits."
3472,尤其值得玩味的是政府对于饥饿民众们的回应，比如总统市民赫伯特·胡佛“别人的事我可管不了”的态度。,"Especially savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude."
3473,虽然他公开赞扬了童年时简单的爱荷华州农舍，但他的饮食却像百万富翁一般精致。,"While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood, he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become."
3474,科先生表示：“他喜欢吃欧式西餐，比如鱼伴黄瓜酱”。,"""He liked to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce,"" Mr. Coe said."
3475,他穿着一件晚礼服，在一间镀金的餐厅中就餐。,"He ate in almost a gold-plated dining room, wearing a dinner jacket."
3476,他显然脱离了人民。,He was fabulously out of touch.
3477,如果不是妻子埃莉诺鼓励他在饮食上树立榜样，罗斯福总统可能也会犯相同的错误。,"President Roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach."
3478,正如本书所言，罗斯福女士所聘用的管家对于味道毫无兴趣，因此白宫里的“食物不仅是华盛顿最难吃的食物，更是烹饪最差的食物。”,"As the book tells it, Mrs. Roosevelt's hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that ""put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared."""
3479,当美国一回到正规，许多大萧条时期的烹饪方式就被摒弃。,Many of the Depression-era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
3480,齐格曼女士表示，所留下的是我们对卡路里和营养的关注以及将科学应用到烹饪中。,"The legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking."
3481,这对夫妻表示在写这本书时，他们进一步了解了齐格曼女士母亲的饮食习惯，比如她如何不把食物丢弃。,"The couple said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance."
3482,科先生说道：“她非常害怕浪费食物。”,"""She had a real fear of food waste,"" Mr. Coe said."
3483,齐格曼女士回忆道：“她实际上让许多人生了病。”,"Ms. Ziegelman recalled: ""She actually got people sick."""
3484,比如曾经发生过一起“奶油泡芙”事件。,There was the cream-puff incident.
3485,在撤掉盘子后，她与科先生拿出了他们在家准备的一份甜品：这就是罗斯福总统在午餐中所吃的果脯布丁。,"After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch."
3486,齐格曼女士说道：“这叫作奶油果脯，“并且补充道为一道普通的菜起一个新潮的名字是“惯用的伎俩”。,"""It's called prune whip,"" Ms. Ziegelman said, adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a snazzy name."
3487,这道甜品中没有生奶油，只有果脯、一点面粉、糖、水和肉桂。,"There was no whipped cream, just prunes, a little bit of flour, sugar, water and cinnamon."
3488,大家都勉为其难地将调羹深入粘稠的棕色糊状物中。,Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo.
3489,意外的是，这道甜品的味道还不错。,"Surprisingly, it wasn't bad."
3490,科先生又吃了第二匙、第三匙。,"Mr. Coe went back for seconds, and thirds."
3491,他觉得这是一道可以接受的实惠甜点，便告诉妻子：“加点碎核桃会更好吃。”,"Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, ""Some chopped walnuts would help."""
3492,可惜，OPEC最新月报显示出7月原油产量继续增加，沙特产量更创下新高。,"Unfortunately, OPEC's latest monthly report shows that the crude oil production in July continued to increase and Saudi Arabia's output hit a new high."
3493,这份报告不禁令市场对OPEC的信誉产生怀疑，油价复苏的道路恐怕仍然布满荆棘。,The report cannot prevent the market from doubting the credibility of OPEC. Oil recovery path is still bristled with thorns.
3494,本周一，OPEC轮值主席兼卡塔尔能源大臣萨达表示，OPEC将在9月26-28日的国际能源论坛期间举行非正式会议。,"On Monday, OPEC Chairman and Qatar Energy Minister Sada said OPEC will hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on September 26-28."
3495,OPEC周三公布的月报显示，包括加蓬在内的整个OPEC组织7月产量上升4.6万桶/日，至3311万桶/日。,"The monthly report of OPEC on Wednesday showed that the output of the entire OPEC organization in July, including Gabon, increased by 46,000 barrels/day to 33.11 million barrels/day."
3496,OPEC还在月报中表示，原油价格低廉已促使全球炼油商生产更多精炼油品，从而加重了市场供应过剩的程度。,"OPEC also said in a monthly report that low crude oil prices have prompted global refiners to produce more refined oil, thus increasing the degree of excess supply to the market."
3497,受此消息影响，再加上美国上调原油产量预期和原油库存意外增加，国际油价连续两日收跌。,"Affected by this news, coupled with the production output expectations of rising crude oil and the unexpected increase in crude oil inventories, aggravating the excessive market supply."
3498,截至周三收盘，纽约商品交易所9月交货的轻质原油期货价格下跌2.48%，10月交货的伦敦布伦特原油期货价格下跌2.07%。,"As of Wednesday's close, the light crude oil futures of New York Mercantile Exchange fell by 2.48% in September and the future price of crude oil in October in London Brent fell by 2.07%."
3499,路透社认为，提议召开的产油国会议不太可能令供应明显收紧，美国能源信息署公布的数据也打压市场人气。,Reuters believes that the proposed meeting of the oil-producing countries is unlikely to tighten the supply. The data released by US Energy Information Administration also suppress the market sentiment.
3500,伊朗官方通讯社Fars周三援引伊朗石油部长赞加内的发言称，伊朗的日原油产量最高为385万桶，这是2008年以来的最高水平。,"Iran's official news agency Fars on Wednesday, quoting the speech of Zanganeh, Iranian oil minister, said that Iran's daily crude oil production was up to 3.85 million barrels, which has been the highest level since 2008."
3501,召开会议的消息刚出，俄罗斯能源部长诺瓦克就表示，当前油价下没有进行新一轮冻产谈判的必要。,"At the release of the news of the meeting, the Russian energy minister Novak said that it was unnecessary to conduct a new round of frozen production negotiations under the current oil price."
3502,上次产油国召开会议已经是4月份的事情，OPEC成员国未能就任何措施达成协议。,It was April when the oil-producing countries had meeting. No agreement was reached among the OPEC member countries.
3503,BMIResearch石油与天然气分析师理查兹（Emma Richards）表示，市场和媒体可能对OPEC将召开的会议反应过度。,"Emma Richards, an oil and gas analyst at BMIResearch, said the market and the media could react excessively to OPEC's meeting."
3504,加拿大皇家银行大宗商品策略主管克罗夫特（Helima Croft）表示，OPEC通过释放他们将促成协议的信号来改变市场的情绪。,"Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, said OPEC changed the market sentiment by releasing signals that they would make an agreement."
3505,这个手段就像是引开人视线的烟雾与镜子（故意给人错误印象）。,This means like a smoke and a mirror that draws people's attention (deliberately giving a false impression).
3506,德国商业银行大宗商品研究主管温伯格（Eugen Weinberg）称，人们认为OPEC试图通过9月会议稳定市场的可能性很低。,"Eugen Weinberg, director of commodity research at the German commercial bank, said the possibility of OPEC trying to stabilize the market through the September meeting was low."
3507,这很可能进一步破坏市场对OPEC的信心，毕竟这个组织上演过一次“狼来了”。,"This is likely to further undermine the market confidence in OPEC. After all, this organization already staged a ""wolf is coming""."
3508,各地要将违规发布医疗广告、投诉举报集中、既往被多次处罚的医疗机构作为抽查重点。,"All localities should take medical institutions which have illegal medical advertising, complaints focusing on the past and have repeatedly been punished as a focus of inspection."
3509,国家卫生计生委、国家中医药管理局将适时组织对部分省份专项监督检查工作开展情况进行督查。,National Health Commission and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine will timely carry out supervision on the supervision and inspection work of some provinces.
3510,据媒体披露，由于此前资本大规模涌入互联网医药，造成目前产品同质化的问题严重，投资热潮渐退，资本进入观望期。,"According to media disclosure, the large influx of capital into the Internet medicine has resulted in the serious problem of current product homogeneity. Investment boom fade gradually and capital came into the wait-and-see period."
3511,另据香港艾力彼医院管理研究中心数据显示，创业一年内的互联网医疗公司大量死亡，约20%的初创互联网医疗企业已不复存在。,"According to the data of Hong Kong Ai Li Pi Hospital Management Research Center, a large number of start-up Internet medical companies languished just within one year and about 20% of the start-up Internet medical companies has ceased to exist."
3512,然而，就在大部分互联网医疗企业挣扎在A轮或B轮的融资路上的时候，有几家细分领域领先企业仍能获得资本热捧。,"However, just as the majority of Internet medical companies struggle in the road of A round or B round of financing, several sub-areas leading enterprises can still get the capital touted."
3513,看来，互联网医疗创业断不可“一窝蜂”，而是要看准市场需求，沉得下心做专，做深。,"It seems that the Internet medical business shall not ""swarm"", but to see the needs of the market, and be professional and profound."
3514,鱼跃出资1200.00万元，占注册资本的40%，九州通器械公司出资1800.00万元，占注册资本的60%。,"Yuyue invested 12 million yuan, accounting for 40% of the registered capital, while Jiuzhoutong invested 18 million yuan, accounting for 60% of the registered capital."
3515,近年来，随着国家在医疗信息化方面的政策支持，电子化、集成化的供应链管理系统逐步进入各级医院。,"In recent years, with the country providing policy support in the medical information, electronic and integrated supply chain management system gradually enter the hospitals at all levels."
3516,此次鱼跃与九州通的合作正是瞄准了市场的需求，帮助医院搭建先进供应链管理系统，并以此为契机谋求更多合作。,"The cooperation between Yuyue and Jiuzhoutong is aimed at the needs of the market, helping the hospital to build advanced supply chain management system, and take this opportunity to seek more cooperation."
3517,与很多互联网医疗公司贪大求全不同，iBaby从最初就专注于互联网产科垂直领域，深耕孕妈和医生两端。,"Unlike many Internet medical companies which go in for grandiose projects, iBaby focuses on the Internet obstetrics vertical field and be professional on pregnant mothers and doctors."
3518,孕妈不仅可以免费24小时和一对一的主管医生问诊，还可以付费定向寻医问诊。,"Pregnant women can not only enjoy 24 hours of medical services free of charge and one-on-one inquiry with doctors, but also pay for medical counseling."
3519,而在医生端，iBaby通过采取组织专家给基层医生开展在线讲座、同行交流、病例讨论等微讲座的形式，打破地域限制。,"At the doctor's side, iBaby breaks the geographical restrictions by taking the form of organizing experts to give grassroots doctors an online lecture, peer exchange, case discussion and so on."
3520,目前医生端开设三个板块，分别为医生继续教育、医生社交和医生求助。,"At present, three plates are set up for doctor's client side, respectively, for doctors to continue education, social exchange and communication."
3521,提供包括在线学习、病例讨论、学术交流；同医院、同科室医生之间社交平台；医患关系或个人生活所需要的法律援助、创业支持等服务内容。,"The following services are provided, including online learning, case discussion and academic exchange; social platform for the exchange of doctors of the same hospital and department; legal assistance, business support and other services required by doctor-patient relationship or personal life."
3522,据媒体报道，CEO王磊近日表示阿里健康“愿意沉下心来”拿下健康大数据。,"According to media reports, CEO Wang Lei recently said Ali health ""is willing to get down"" to win big health data."
3523,互联网公司、数据公司缺少专业性，在同一词条上的书写方法上都达不到统一。,Internet companies and data companies are short of professionalism. No unity can be provided on the same entry.
3524,阿里目前在医疗健康领域的布局分为三块，分别是阿里健康、天猫医药馆和支付宝未来医院。,"The layout of Ali in the medical and health field is divided into three plates, namely, Ali Health, Lynx Pharmacy and Alipay future hospital."
3525,王磊坦言，医疗健康创业会比其他行业要难，“这不仅仅是有多少钱的事情，还要沉得下心，耐得住寂寞慢慢去做。”,"Wang Lei admitted that it was more difficult for medical and health companies to start up than other industries, ""This is not just how much money you have. In addition, it requires people to be concentrated on it and endure the loneliness."
3526,连续熬夜看奥运赛事容易损伤心脏,Staying up late watching the Olympic Games will damage the heart easily
3527,巴西奥运会赛事正如火如荼地进行，即便赛事播出时在国内是半夜时分，很多市民也会熬夜观看。,"Brazil Olympic Games is in full swing. Even if the event is broadcast in the midnight in China, many people will stay up late to watch."
3528,对此，医生特别提醒，熬夜看赛事存在健康隐患，有可能引发心血管疾病。,"In this regard, the doctor reminded that staying up late has health risks and may lead to cardiovascular disease."
3529,如果长时间熬夜，该激素仍会大量分泌，人体会持续处于紧张兴奋的状态，无法得到正常的恢复，容易引起血管收缩、血压升高，从而引起心血管疾病。,"If you stay up for a long time, the hormone will have a lot of secretion and your body will continue to be in a state of intense excitement and cannot have normal recovery. This may easily cause vasoconstriction, blood pressure and thus cardiovascular disease."
3530,韩志远特别提醒，有高血压、高血糖、高血脂、吸烟习惯、家族病史等心血管危险因素的群体，如果熬夜，会更容易引发心血管疾病。,"Han Zhiyuan reminded people who have high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood lipids, smoking habits, family history and other cardiovascular risk factors may easily suffer from cardiovascular disease if staying up late."
3531,如果长期熬夜，不仅心血管功能受影响，而且胃肠功能、免疫系统、神经内分泌系统都会受影响，甚至罹患肿瘤的风险也会增大。,"If you stay up late, then your cardiovascular function will be affected, your gastrointestinal function, immune system, neuroendocrine system will also be affected, and even the risk of cancer will increase."
3532,对于老年朋友，韩志远建议，尽量不要为了看奥运比赛而熬夜，特别是有心血管疾病史的群体。,"For old friends, Han Zhiyuan suggested them better not stay up late to watch games, particularly those with cardiovascular disease."
3533,在上届“世界杯”足球赛期间，韩志远曾接诊过一名60多岁的患者，其心肌梗塞的引发或与熬夜看比赛有关。,"During the last ""World Cup"" football match, Han Zhiyuan received a 60-year-old patient. His onset of myocardial infarction may be related with staying up late to watch games."
3534,韩志远介绍，今年以来，其科室已接诊了一些25岁左右的心肌梗塞或者脑中风患者，这很大程度上是患者长期熬夜的生活方式造成的。,"According to Han Zhiyuan, his department had treated some 25-year-old myocardial infarction or stroke patients. This is largely due to long-term stay up of patients."
3535,1.不要每天都熬夜，偶尔熬夜观看最喜欢的体育项目，其他项目不妨等第二天看赛事重播。,1. Do not stay up late every day. You can occasionally stay up all night watching the favorite sports and watch the rebroadcast for other sports next day.

3549,纪录片《极地》是一部聚焦地球第三极青藏高原的大型作品，以全新视角讲述藏地传统与现代交融以及西藏与世界互动的故事。,"The documentary ""Polar"" is a large-scale work that focuses on the world's third pole, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It tells a story for the integration of Tibetan tradition and the modern world and the interaction between Tibet and the world from a new perspective."
3550,VR作品的最大优势是令观众具有独一无二的观影“沉浸”感，而这也对拍摄过程提出了更高要求。,"The biggest advantage for VR works is to enable the audience to have a unique movie watching ""immersion"" and this also raise a higher request for the shooting process."
3551,《极地》全景VR特别版的摄制团队表示，他们要确保每一个方位的画面都无可挑剔，让观众有身临其境之感。,"The production team of ""Polar"" Panorama VR special edition said that they will ensure that every aspect of the screen is impeccable and let the audiences have senses of immersive."
3552,8月11日，武警山东总队烟台支队组织特战狙击手冒着34摄氏度的高温来到昆嵛山开展丛林训练。,"On August 11, the Armed Police Shandong Corps Yantai detachment organized special war snipers to have jungle training at Kunyu Mountain under the high temperature of 34 degrees Celsius."
3553,冷战期间，苏联把导弹运进古巴，差点导致美苏发生核战争。,"During the Cold War, the Soviet Union transported the missile into Cuba, which almost led to the US-Soviet nuclear war."
3554,这一事件被看做冷战的顶峰，史称“古巴导弹危机”。,"This event was seen as the pinnacle of the cold war, known as the ""Cuban missile crisis."""
3555,但鲜为人知的是，同样是冷战期间，一场强烈的太阳风暴也曾险些导致美国对苏联发动核战争，这一事件直到8月9日才首次由研究人员对外公布。,"But what is little known is that during the Cold War, a strong solar storm has almost led to a nuclear war of the United States against the Soviet Union. The incident has not been announced by the researchers until August 9."
3556,1967年5月23日，一场强烈的太阳风暴对美国军方位于北极的雷达与无线电通信造成强烈干扰。,"On May 23, 1967, a strong solar storm caused strong interference to the radar and radio communications of the US military in the Arctic."
3557,这些雷达是美国弹道导弹预警系统的一部分，用于监测苏联的导弹。,"These radars were part of the ballistic missile early warning system of the US, used for monitoring Soviet missiles."
3558,这篇由美国科罗拉多大学研究人员完成的论文采访了当时参与预报与分析太阳活动的美军方人员，并查阅了非保密文献。,"This paper was written by researchers at the University of Colorado, who interviewed US military personnel involved in the forecasting and analysis of solar activity and reviewed non-confidential documents."
3559,论文写道，上世纪60年代，为防止苏联突然发动核战争，美国空军始终有一部分载有核弹头的战机飞在天上。,"The paper wrote that in the 1960s, in order to prevent the Soviet Union from suddenly launching nuclear war, the US Air Force has always had some fighters with nuclear warheads flying in the sky."
3560,美军军方指挥官不知道这次干扰的罪魁祸首是太阳风暴而非苏联，于是下令使战机进入战斗准备状态。,"US military commanders did not know that the culprit of the interference was the solar storm rather than the Soviet Union, so they ordered the fighters to enter combat readiness state."
3561,幸运的是，美国军方从上世纪50年代末就开始的太阳活动及其对地球电磁干扰的研究，最终阻止了这场潜在的军事冲突。,"Fortunately, the US military force had started the study of solar activities and its electromagnetic interference to the Earth since the 1950s, it ultimately stopped this potential military conflict."
3562,稍后，他汇总美国空军航空气象处提供的信息，提交了一份详细报告。,"Later, he summarized the information provided by the US Air Force Air Meteorological Service and submitted a detailed report."
3563,这场太阳风暴的直接后果是，美国军方从此把空间天气视为一项作战关切，并建立了一个更强大的空间天气预报系统。,The direct consequence of this solar storm is that the US military has seen space weather as a combat concern and has built a stronger space weather forecast system.
3564,市民在日常出行中，发现爱车被陌生车辆阻碍了，在联系不上陌生车辆司机的情况下，可以使用“微信挪车”功能解决这一困扰。,"During daily travel, when citizens found that their cars were hampered by a strange vehicle, they may use ""WeChat vehicle moving"" function to solve this problem when they failed to contact with the strange vehicle driver."
3565,8月11日起，西安交警微信服务号“西安交警”推出“微信挪车”服务。,"From August 11, Xi'an traffic police WeChat service number ""Xi'an traffic police"" launched ""WeChat vehicle moving"" service."
3566,这项服务推出后，日常生活中，市民如遇陌生车辆在驾驶人不在现场的情况下阻碍自己车辆行驶时，就可通过使用“微信挪车”功能解决此类问题。,"After the launching of this service, during daily life, when the citizens found their cars were hampered by unfamiliar vehicles, the driver of which is not at the scene, they may solve the problems via ""WeChat"" function."
3567,这个新服务功能一是快捷，节省行政成本；二是尊重、保护公民个人隐私；三是全天候、全时段服务。,"The new service has many functions, the first of which is fast efficiency, saving administrative costs; the second is respecting and protecting the privacy of citizens; and the third is all-weather and full-time service."

3571,商洛供电公司丹凤县公司结合精神文明建设工作，积极组织开展“相约古镇情满电力”暨我们的节日·七夕主题活动。,"Shangluo Power Supply Company Danfeng County Company combines with the construction of spiritual civilization, and actively organizes the ""introduce electricity activity in the ancient town"" and Double Seventh Festival theme activities."
3572,参加活动的公司职工表示：“自己平时主要精力都用在工作和学习上，缺少时间和平台去和同事、朋友交流。”,"Staff who participated in the activities said, ""We spent most of our time on work and study, so we lack time and platform to chat with my colleagues and friends."""
3573,“这次公司为我们提供了这样一个轻松、快乐、和谐的平台，我非常喜欢，有意义又不失趣味。”,"""This time the company has provided us with such a relaxed, happy and harmonious platform. I really like it, meaningful and interesting."""
3574,七夕活动受到了现场青年职工们的广泛好评，纷纷希望该公司以后多举办这样的活动，与更多其他的青年加强沟通与交流。,"Double Seventh Festival theme activities have won wide acclaim of youth staff at the scene. They hope that the company would later organize such activities, and strengthen communication and exchange with more other young people."

3576,作为金满贯得主的纳达尔，对奥运会情有独钟，伤未痊愈的他，此次三线出击，斩获颇丰。,"Nadal, the grand slam gold winner, shows special preference to the Olympic Games. The unhealed Nadal struck and made a huge gain."

3581,这一天进行的混双比赛也决出了八强，不过头号种子马胡／加西亚组合的落马，以及纳豆组合的退赛，令混双比赛略有些失色。,"The final eight is also produced in the mixed doubles on the same day, but the defeat of the number one seed Ma Hu/Garcia combination and the withdrawal of Natto combination outshone the mixed doubles."
3582,2015年4月27日，美国和日本在纽约联合发表新版《美日防卫合作指针》，允许日本武装力量在全球扮演更具进攻性的角色。,"On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly issued a new version of ""US-Japan defense cooperation guidelines"" in New York, allowing the Japanese armed forces to play a more offensive role in the world."
3583,这是当日美国国防部长卡特、美国国务卿克里、日本外务大臣岸田文雄和日本防卫大臣中谷元在纽约出席新闻发布会。,"This is the day the US Defense Secretary Carter, US Secretary of State Kerry, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and Japan's Minister of Defense Gen Nakatani attended the press conference in New York."
3584,这是中国民间智库第五次发表日本军力评估报告，也是第四次推出英文版。,This is the fifth time that China's civilian think tank has published the Japanese military assessment report and the fourth launch of the English version.
3585,报告分9章，包括总体政策调整、军事实力、国防预算、军事部署、武器装备、体制编制改革、军事训演、对外军事安全合作、对华军事安全关系等内容。,"The report is divided into nine chapters, including the overall policy adjustment, military strength, defense budget, military deployment, weapons and equipment, military system reform, military training, foreign military security cooperation and military security relations with China and so on."
3586,报告称，2015年是安倍政府在安全领域连续数年推进重大政策调整的阶段性收官之年。,The report said that the year 2015 is a phased last year of the Abe government to promote major policy adjustments in the security area.
3587,此后，日本在安全领域的举措将主要是在法制运用、战略贯彻、政策落实等操作层面，而不是框架、机制和政策的大幅调整和变动。,"Since then, Japan's initiatives in the field of security will be mainly in the legal system, strategy implementation, policy implementation and other operational level, rather than the substantial adjustments and changes of framework, mechanisms and policies."
3588,报告强调，安倍内阁试图通过以上三点突破，达到推动日本“正常国家化”、自卫队走出去介入国际安全事务、强化日美同盟、防华制华的多重目的。,"The report emphasized that the Abe Cabinet tried to break through the above three points to achieve the promotion of Japan's ""normal nationalization"", and the going-out of militia to intervene in international security affairs, strengthen Japan-US alliance and prevent the rise of China and resist China."
3589,此前，中国战略文化促进会先后于2012年6月5日、2013年7月19日、2014年7月23日、2015年6月30日发布过日本军力评估报告。,"Previously, the China Strategy and Culture Promotion Council released the Japanese military assessment report on June 5, 2012, July 19, 2013, July 23, 2014 and June 30, 2015."
3590,英国《金融时报》8月12日发布了一组美国驻华大使官邸的图集。,"British ""Financial Times"" on August 12 released a group of pictures on mansion of US ambassador to China."
3591,文章称，与之形成对比的是，美国大使官邸从外观来看，完全可以在下一部改编自约翰勒卡雷冷战间谍小说的电影中作为安全屋。,"According to the article, in contrast, the appearance of the American ambassador's residence, from the appearance of view, can be used as safety house in the cold war spy novels of John le Carré."
3592,官邸是灰色的，并用外围防护栏、第二层内墙、带刺铁丝网以及车辆路障层层严密防守。,"The residence is gray, and strongly fortified by peripheral fence, the second interior wall, barbed wire entanglement and vehicle roadblocks."
3593,补齐公共体育设施短板,Improvement of public sports facilities
3594,黑乎乎的煤场仓库，变成“绿草如茵”的足球场；红砖尖顶的厂房，变成现代化的运动馆。,"Dark coal field warehouse is turned into a ""green grass"" football field while red brick spire plant is turned into a modern sports museum."
3595,在全民健身日，杭州望江门外的南落马营体育文化公园，揭开了神秘的面纱。,"On the national fitness day, Nanluo Maying Sports Culture Park, outside the Hangzhou Wangjiang gate, unveiled its mysterious veil."
3596,这里曾是煤场，十多年前关闭后一直闲置，留下了大量的违法建筑和生活垃圾。,It was a coal field once and remained idle for more than 10 years after its closure. A large number of illegal construction and garbage were left behind.
3597,这里经过整治后，成了体育文化公园，并将于11月正式对外开放，向市民免费提供运动场所，也无疑为全民体育开辟了全新的沃土。,"After the renovation, it became a sports and cultural park, and will be officially opened in November to the public free of charge to provide sports venues. In addition, it would undoubtedly open up a new fertile soil for the whole people."
3598,这不禁让人想起杭州陈经纶体校，这座中国泳坛的“黄埔军校”游出了多名世界冠军。,"This reminds people of Hangzhou Chen Jinglun School. This is a ""Whampoa Military Academy"" in China's swimming world, in which several world champions were born."
3599,泳坛名将源源不断地产生，生动地诠释了竞技体育与全民体育之间的关系——丰厚的群众基础为选拔专业选手提供了良好的条件。,"Swimming champions will be produced continuously, producing a vivid interpretation of the relationship between competitive sports and national sports. The profound mass base provided a good condition for selecting professional players."
3600,竞技体育的水平与全民体育的基础密切相关，竞技体育在一定意义上取决于全民体育，而全民体育又取决于场地条件。,"The level of competitive sports is closely related to the foundation of national sports. Athletic sports depend in a certain sense on national sports, and national sports depend on the conditions of the site."
3601,据报道，截至2015年，我国的人均体育场地面积虽然已是新中国成立时的150倍，但仍远远落后于体育强国。,"According to reports, as of 2015, the area of China's per capita sports venues has been 150 times of that when the new China was established, but still far behind the sports power."
3602,今年6月，国务院印发了《全民健身计划（2016-2020年）》，将发展群众体育作为重点内容。,"In June this year, the State Council issued a ""National Fitness Program (2016 - 2020)"" and took the development of mass sports as a key content."
3603,为了补齐这块短板，一方面，相关部门在进行城市规划时要充分考虑到体育场馆的布局。,"In order to fill the short board, on the one hand, the relevant departments shall take full account of the layout of the stadium at urban planning."
3604,另一方面，已建成的公共体育场馆，包括学校等单位里的体育场馆，应尽量扩大开放范围，尽可能地提高使用效率。,"On the other hand, the already built public sports venues, including schools and other units in the sports venues, should try to expand the scope of openness and try to improve efficiency as much as possible."
3605,目前正如火如荼进行着的里约奥运会，激发着人们的运动热情，也唤醒了大家的参与意识。,"The Rio Olympic Games, which is in full swing, has stimulated people's enthusiasm for sports, but also aroused everyone's awareness of participation."
3606,吉利德在与默克的丙型肝炎专利之争中获得律师费,Gilead to get attorney fees in hepatitis C patent fight with Merck
3607,根据美国地区法官的判决，吉列德科学公司有权获得在与制药公司美国默克集团的丙型肝炎专利诉讼中所产生的律师费。,"Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive the attorney fees it incurred related to hepatitis C patent litigation with drugmaker Merck &amp; Co Inc, a U.S. district judge has ruled."
3608,六月，在美国法官发现默克公司存在违法行为，包括作伪证和其他不道德行为之后，吉列德免于支付因吉利德的畅销药品索非布韦和哈沃尼侵犯默克公司的两项专利而产生的2亿美元赔偿款。,"In June, Gilead was freed from paying up $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a pattern of misconduct by Merck including lying under oath and other unethical practices."
3609,在周四的诉讼中，美国地区法官贝斯·兰博松·弗里曼表示，吉利德无需承担因辩护所产生的费用。,"In a filing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to relief from the fees it incurred while defending the case."
3610,默克公司正在试图追赶统治新一代丙型肝炎药物市场的吉列德。吉列德的药物可以治愈90%以上的肝炎患者。,"Merck is trying to catch up to Gilead, which dominates the market on a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease."
3611,该案最早要追溯到2013年，当时吉利德和默克互相起诉对方，双方都声称自己是吉利德药物中的有效成分 —— 索非布韦的实验室工作的所有者。,"The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs."
3612,美国支持的部队宣布他们已从伊斯兰国手中夺回曼比季,U.S. backed forces say they have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
3613,部队发言人于周五表示，城内残留的伊斯兰国士兵已全部离开，美国支持的部队已完全控制土耳其边境附近的北部城市曼比季。,"U.S.-backed forces have seized full control of northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters inside the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday."
3614,在躲进城内的激进分子离开后，叙利亚民主力量 (SDF) 现在正在对全城进行扫荡。,Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) were now sweeping the city after the departure of a remaining group of militants who had been holed up in the city.
3615,"叙利亚民主力量同盟曼比季军事委员会的莎兰·达尔维什告诉路透社，他们已解救了2,000多名被激进分子劫持的平民。","They had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters."
3616,他告诉路透社：“曼比季现在全在我们的控制之下，但我们仍在进行扫荡。”,"""The city is now fully under our control but we are undertaking sweeping operations,"" he told Reuters."

3619,2015年，克林顿夫妇的慈善捐款金额为100万美元，其中大部分捐助给了克林顿基金会；前总统比尔·克林顿的演讲费达到近530万美元，而前国务卿凭借一本关于她在国务院任职期间的书从出版商西蒙与舒斯特那里获得了300万美元的收入。,"In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; and the former secretary of state reported income of $3 million from publisher Simon &amp; Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department."

3621,两人2015年缴纳了20.3%的联邦税。,They paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015.
3622,克林顿的竞选助手詹妮弗·帕尔米耶里在一份声明中表示：希拉里·克林顿和蒂姆·凯恩将继续成为财务透明的标杆。”,"""Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency,"" Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement."
3623,与之形成鲜明对比的是，唐纳德·特朗普以虚假的理由进行掩盖并且收回了他之前所作出的公布纳税申报单的承诺。,"In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns."
3624,虽然法律没有要求，但按照惯例，美国总统候选人应公开他们的纳税申报单。,"It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public, although they are not required by law to do so."
3625,作为一名纽约商人，特朗普以及他的律师将美国国税局的审计作为拒绝公布纳税申报单的理由。,"Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns."
3626,克林顿竞选助手伊恩·萨姆斯在推特上表示由你们做主，并且附上了民主党候选人的纳税申报单链接。,"""Your move,"" Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, linking to the Democratic nominee's returns."
3627,周四，特朗普的特别法律顾问迈克尔·科恩向CNN表示，在审计完成前他不会允许特朗普公布纳税申报单。,"On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete."
3628,批评特朗普的人，包括2012年共和党总统候选人米特·罗姆尼和其他共和党人表示特朗普拒绝公布纳税申报单会引发对其资本净值、慈善捐款、商业交易和各种其他关系的质疑，包括与俄罗斯的关系。,"Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and various other ties, including with Russia."
3629,克林顿抓住这一问题猛烈抨击，于周五发布了一段网络视频，突出高调的民主党人敦促特朗普公布其纳税情况。,"Clinton has pounced on the issue, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes."
3630,周四，她在密歇根州的经济政策演讲中提出了这个问题。,"On Thursday, she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan."
3631,她对众人说：“几十年来，他拒绝像其他总统候选人那样公布自己的纳税申报单。”,"""He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns,"" she told the crowd."
3632,根据《政客新闻网》的报道，特朗普在上世纪九十年代有两年几乎没有缴纳过一分钱的税，《纽约时报》商业专栏作家于周五引用了多位税务律师和会计的话，他们均表示目前的情况可能依然如此。,"Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case."
3633,联邦税已成为总统竞选中的一大问题。,Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election.
3634,克林顿用身价亿万的投资家沃伦·巴菲特的名字命名了一条规定，保证年收入超过100万美元的人至少缴纳30%的税。,Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
3635,奥巴马总统也支持这项提议。,President Barack Obama also backs the proposal.
3636,上周，克林顿在伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司所在的内布拉斯加州奥马哈举行了一次集会，巴菲特在会上要求特朗普见面并交换纳税申报单。,"At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns."
3637,巴菲特表示，他也正在接受IRS的审计，特朗普“害怕的”不是税务机关，而是选民。,"Buffet said that he too was under IRS audit and Trump is ""afraid"" not of the tax-collection agency but of voters."
3638,克林顿竞选小组所公布的最早的纳税申报单为2007年。,Clinton's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007.
3639,目前居住在纽约查巴克的克林顿夫妇在2007年至2014年期间所缴纳的平均联邦税率达到约32%，综合税率约40.5%。,"The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent."
3640,克林顿夫妇2015年的纳税申报单显示，与大部分美国人不同，他们的工资收入只有100美元。,"The Clintons' 2015 return showed that, unlike most Americans, just $100 of their income came from wages."

3643,犹太电影制片人批评柏林酒店按照阿拉伯客户的“要求”删除以色列电话代码 —— 路透社新闻,"Jewish filmmaker slams Berlin hotel for removing Israel dial code after Arab ""request"" - RT News"
3644,一位有着犹太血统的法国电影制片人向媒体透露，位于柏林的凯宾斯基酒店没有列出以色列的电话代码，并且酒店员工表示这是按照阿拉伯客户的“要求”，这引发了舆论一片哗然。,"A French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's dial code, with employee citing ""requests"" from Arabic customers."
3645,犹太人大屠杀纪录片《浩劫》的作者克劳德·朗兹曼表达了他对凯宾斯基酒店的失望，并且在德国《法兰克福汇报》上发表了一封公开信。,"Claude Lanzmann, an author of Holocaust documentary ""Shoah,"" vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German outlet FAZ."
3646,在最近入住期间，朗兹曼想在酒店提供的电话代码列表上找到以色列。,"During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel."
3647,但以色列没有在客人可以直接从房间通话的国家之列。,The country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room.
3648,以色列居然在2016年德国的首都柏林消失了？,"How is it possible, in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and eradicated?"
3649,朗兹曼写道。,Lanzmann wrote.
3650,取而代之的是，客人可以通过凯宾斯基酒店的呼叫中心拨打以色列电话。,"Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to dial Israel via an own call center."
3651,为了寻求解释，这位电影制片人询问了酒店的前台。,"Seeking explanation, the filmmaker addressed the issue at the hotel's reception."
3652,朗兹曼在信中表示，他在前台得到的回答“令他感到震惊”。,"The answer he got there, Lanzmann wrote ""shocked him."""
3653,酒店人员表示，这是“凯宾斯基酒店管理层刻意作出的决定”。,"The hotel's clerk said that the measure was ""a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski-Hotels."""
3654,而这么做的理由更是让这位电影制片人感到愤怒。,The reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker.
3655,朗兹曼引用了这名员工的原话：我们的大部分客人都是阿拉伯人，他们要求删除以色列的代码。”,"""The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Israel's code to be deleted,"" the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann."
3656,根据《南德日报》的报道，以色列驻德国大使雅科夫·哈达斯·汉德尔斯曼将这件事称为“奇耻大辱”。,"Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a ""great shame,"" Suddeutsche Zeitung reports."
3657,得知这一事件，我们感到大吃一惊。,We were appalled and shocked by the incident.
3658,这件事本身就是一个巨大的耻辱。,It is in itself a great shame.
3659,而发生在德国和那家连锁酒店更是丢人现眼。,"The fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very hotel chain, is an even greater disgrace."
3660,这件事无需任何解释。,That needs no explanation.
3661,“我们希望该酒店能够得出正确的结论，”该官员表示。,"We expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions,"" the official said."
3662,这一事件在网上引发了热议，大家都认为这是一桩丑闻。,"The incident triggered quite a response online, with people calling it a scandal."
3663,有人认为凯宾斯基酒店简直是为了满足阿拉伯客户的要求而“卑躬屈膝”。,"Some alleged that the Kempinski hotel simply ""caved in"" to the alleged demands of Arabic customers."
3664,另一个帖子直指酒店“真不要脸”，并且指出这家位于著名的库达姆大街的大街就在一座犹太教会堂附近。,"""Shame on you,"" another post stated, pointing out that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street stands near a synagogue."
3665,据《明镜周刊》的报道，酒店很快对所有指控予以澄清，声称一切都是“疏忽”并且向朗兹曼表示“歉意”。,"The hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations, calling what happened an ""oversight"" and ""apologizing"" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports."
3666,《南德日报》引用了凯宾斯基代表的话：“从来没有下达过将以色列从快速拨号列表中删除的直接命令”。,"""There was never a direct order"" not to include Israel in the fast dial list,"" Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying."
3667,该报还表示以色列代码已加入到列表中。,It adds that the code was now added.
3668,警方使用催泪瓦斯和橡胶子弹驱逐抗议的巴西学生,Police use tear gas &amp; rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
3669,周四，在巴西圣保罗，学生在抗议政府公共教育体系改革的过程中与警方发生了冲突。,Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system.
3670,警方使用催泪瓦斯和橡胶子弹驱逐抗议者。,Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
3671,此次事件的起因是执法部门官员试图驱散学生，因此警方使用了橡胶子弹和催泪瓦斯。,"The trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the students, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas."
3672,几百名学生参加了此次游行，表达了他们对这些方案的不满。,Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dismay at the plans.
3673,为了节省资金，圣保罗州州长奥克明计划关闭100所公立学校，30万名学生将转校。,"Under proposals from the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be relocated in order to save money."
3674,一些参加抗议的学生通过墙上的涂鸦表达了对临时总统米歇尔·特梅尔的不满。,Some of those taking part in the protest could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against the interim President Michel Temer.
3675,就在最近的一次抗议发生前几天，抗议者集体走上街头，支持被国家参议院弹劾的总统迪尔玛·罗塞夫。,This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country's senate voted for her impeachment.
3676,苏格兰自行车手卡尔姆·斯金纳夺得自行车金牌后载誉而归,Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brits grab cycling gold
3677,苏格兰自行车手卡尔姆·斯金纳昨晚在里约自行车赛场男子团体竞速赛帮助英国三人组继2012年伦敦奥运会之后成功卫冕奥运会金牌。,Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012.
3678,这位23岁的格拉斯哥自行车手代替了他的苏格兰同胞——克里斯·霍伊爵士，成为了队伍的中坚。当年轻的斯金纳击败夺冠热门新西兰队并载誉而归时，就连这位传奇自行车手也为他感到骄傲。,The Glaswegian 23-year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy made his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured New Zealand outfit.
3679,四年前，英国队一鸣惊人，而霍伊夺得了个人六块奥运会金牌中的第五块。,Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic golds.
3680,英国队在三月伦敦的世界单车场地锦标赛上仅名列第六，霍伊自此退役。然后，英国队再创辉煌。,"And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired."
3681,在北京奥运会到伦敦奥运会期间，英国队的问题在于换掉了“第一圈专家”杰米·斯塔夫。,The issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist starter Jamie Staff.
3682,车队正是在辛德斯出现时才这么做的。,They did so just in time as Hindes emerged.
3683,霍伊的退役也留下了一个空白，而奇恩·伊玛迪和马特·克兰普顿都想来填补这个空白。,Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
3684,在看到斯金纳的潜力后，英国男队教练组坚持让他入选国家队，而斯金纳最终也不负众望。,"Skinner was the man Britain's coaches stuck with, seeing potential in the Scot which has now been realised."
3685,斯金纳的搭档是四年前与霍伊一同夺得金牌的辛德斯和肯尼。三人在资格赛中刷新了奥运会纪录，但这一成绩在第一轮被新西兰队所超越。,"Hindes, Kenny - champions with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round."
3686,而这三位英国自行车赛最终击败对手，夺得金牌。,And the British trio won the duel for gold.
3687,虽然辛德斯稍有落后，但肯尼为团队取得领先，斯金纳将这一领先优势保持到了最后。,"Hindes was narrowly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team in front and Skinner held on."
3688,战略的改变是这一逆转的关键，辛德斯选择了较大的飞轮，因此速度较慢，而这让肯尼，尤其是斯金纳能够保持速度。,"A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace."
3689,霍伊以BBC评论员的身份观看了比赛。斯金纳、肯尼和辛德斯在登上领奖台时看到了他。,"Hoy watched on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium."
3690,23岁的格拉斯哥自行车手斯金纳表示：“这让我受宠若惊。”,"The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, said: ""It's a flattering comparison."""
3691,我只是尽我所能，让自己扬名立万而已。,I'm just out there to do my best and make a name for myself.
3692,我们在决赛中创造了奥运会纪录并且击败了世界冠军。,We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
3693,这太令人难以置信了。,It was just incredible.
3694,没有什么比这场胜利更棒了。,There's no better way to win it.
3695,在2012年伦敦奥运会上与肯尼和霍伊夺得金牌后，辛德斯承认在起步不佳的情况下故意摔落在赛道上。,"After triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start."
3696,后来，他撤回了这番评论，而英国队的对手们也无法上诉。,He later retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain's rivals.
3697,而这次的胜利没有任何此类问题。,There was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory.
3698,辛德斯表示：“这就像在伦敦，站台上都是英国的国旗。”,"Hindes said: ""It felt like London, with all the GB flags in the stand."""
3699,我们在三个月前才刚刚组队。,We all as a team came together in the last three months.
3700,我们已经丢掉了很多世界冠军，所以能够卫冕奥运冠军太令人感到惊讶了。,"We've been losing out on so many world titles, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing."
3701,这对于在北京奥运会和伦敦奥运会上夺得10块场地自行车赛金牌中的7块的英国队而言只是一场比赛、一块金牌而已。,"That is one event, one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track titles in both Beijing and London."
3702,如果这象征着过去五个月我们所取得进步，那么我们将在未来五天继续在自行车馆取得成功。,"If that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months, then a successful five days in the velodrome awaits."
3703,根据肯尼所展现的状态，他并非没有可能再现霍伊在一届奥运会上夺得三块金牌的壮举。,"With the form Kenny demonstrated, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic golds in one Games."
3704,如果是这样的话，比霍伊年轻12岁并且同样在3月23日 （这一天似乎是英国体育界的神圣日子，史蒂夫·雷德格雷夫、莫·法拉和罗杰·班尼斯特也是在这一天出生的) 出生的肯尼将拥有6块金牌和1块银牌。,"That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver."
3705,这一成绩与霍伊持平。,That would be the same as Hoy's.
3706,肯尼接下来将出战于今天开始、为期三天的竞速赛。,"Kenny next competes in the sprint, which begins on today and plays out over three days."
3707,这位28岁的博尔顿人表示：“我暂时会专注于这项比赛。,"The 28-year-old from Bolton said: ""I'm just enjoying this one for now."
3708,团队赛始终是最棒的。,The team event is always the best.
3709,你可以与队友一起赢得比赛。,You get to win it with your mates.
3710,坦率地讲，一个人获胜有点孤独。,It's a bit lonely winning on your own to be honest.
3711,辛德斯表示：“如果他能夺得另两块金牌，那么他应该会被授予爵士封号。”,"Hindes said: ""If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knighthood."""
3712,这是当天唯一一场产生奖牌的比赛，但英国队收到了其他好消息。,"It was the day's only medal event, but there was further good news for Britain."
3713,布拉德利·威金斯爵士、艾德·克兰西、史蒂文·伯克和欧文·杜尔以最快成绩晋级四人四公里团体追逐赛。,"Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified fastest in the four-man, four-kilometres team pursuit."
3714,他们的成绩是351.943。,They finished in 3:51.943.
3715,而2012年伦敦奥运会金牌获得者的世界纪录是351.659。,"The world record, set in winning gold at London 2012, is 3:51.659."
3716,第一轮和决赛 （晚上10点42分） 于今天第二比赛日举行，威金斯无疑将成为万众瞩目的焦点。,"The first round and final (10.42pm) take place on today's second day of action, where Wiggins is sure to be the focus."
3717,昨天他在资格赛前与比赛官员发生了争执，当时比赛官员让他测量身高。,"He had a dispute with commissaires yesterday ahead of the qualification ride, when officials summoned him to measure his height."
3718,在将于明天结束的女子组比赛中，劳拉·特洛特、乔安娜·罗瑟尔·尚德、埃莉诺·巴克和来自米尔盖的凯特·阿奇博尔德以新的世界纪录413.260晋级。,"In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time, clocking 4:13.260."
3719,英国队依靠强大的其场地自行车队在奥运会中期占据主动并且囊获多枚奖牌。,Team GB have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of medals.
3720,在北京和伦敦奥运会上展现其绝对统治地位后，英国自行车队在前往里约的过程中让大家略感失望。,"After truly exceptional showings of utter dominance at Beijing and London, expectations have been played down in the lead-up to Rio."
3721,期间发生了许多波折，包括四月技术总监肖恩·萨顿因性别歧视和欺凌指控而辞职以及霍伊、维多利亚·彭德尔顿等传奇人物的退役。,"There have been dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, and the retirements of giant figures like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."
3722,但自行车馆的首个比赛夜足以证明英国队将再度上演关键时刻达到巅峰状态的传奇。,"However, on the evidence of the first night's racing in the velodrome, it looks like GB's now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again."
3723,在小生命来到这个世上之后，爸爸妈妈们就要对这个生命负责，这个负责不仅仅在于孩子的身体健康上，还在于精神的发展上，也就是教育。,"After the little baby came to this world, Mom and Dad shall be responsible for his life, not only for his health, but also for the development of his spirit, that is, education."
3724,如果在子女的教育上失败，那么即使事业再成功，也无法弥补生活的缺憾、家庭的失败。,"If such education failed, then no matter how successful your career is, you cannot make up for the shortcomings of life and family failure."
3725,当一个新生命降临的时候，新爸新妈们就需要花费时间精力来照看和教育孩子，对他负责。,"When a new baby is born, the new dad and mom need to spend time in taking care of and educating him, and be responsible for him."
3726,而负责任，除了体现在身体的护养，让他们健康，还在于精神的教育，也就是让孩子学习如何做人，如何成人，如何成功。,"And responsibility is not only reflected in the care of body, making them healthy, but also the education of spirit. That is, to make children learn how to behave, grow up and succeed."
3727,良好的家庭教育意味着父母需要经常的陪伴孩子，给孩子关爱，耐心的照顾，另外还需要教孩子养成文明的言行举止，让孩子更好的学习知识，提升智力。,"Good family education means that parents often need to accompany their children, to take care of them patiently and teach them develop a civilized behavior and make them learn knowledge better and enhance intelligence."
3728,父母的一言一行都会影响到孩子的成长，他们会模仿自己的父母，也就是人们常说的龙生龙，凤生凤，老鼠的儿子会打洞，父母什么样孩子就什么样。,"Parents' words and deeds will affect the growth of their children because they will imitate their parents. And that is the so called, ""like father, like son"". Your son will be the same as you."
3729,所以父母在孩子面前需要做个好榜样，规范自己的言行，培养自己优秀品格，这些都可以间接的帮助孩子塑造良好的心性，让他更加优秀。,"So we need to be a good example in front of children, regulate our words, cultivate our characters, which will indirectly help children shape their own excellent character, so that he will become more excellent."
3730,艾米是一个聪明漂亮的女孩。,Amy is a smart and pretty girl.
3731,她性格外向活泼，能与朋友们很好地相处，对环境的适应能力也不错。,"She is outgoing and can get along well with friends. In addition, she can adapts to the environment quite well."
3732,但艾米心里有一个小小的秘密：她不能长久将注意力集中在她要做的学习、工作任务上。,But Amy has a little secret in her heart: she cannot concentrate long on what she wants to do and works on.
3733,这个秘密陪伴艾米很久了。平时问题并不严重》,This secret is accompanied by Amy for a long time. Usually the problem is not serious.
3734,即便通过分散的，模块化的时间来学习和工作，她也基本上都可以完成任务，并取得不错的成绩。,"Even though she learns and works in decentralized, modular, she can complete the task basically, and achieve good results."
3735,但是，当任务重，时间紧的时候，艾米就感觉到非常痛苦和折磨。,"However, when the task is heavy and pressing, Amy feels very painful and tortured."
3736,个体对于自我暴露及其情绪体验的抵抗，其目的在于不使个体的自我认识与自尊受到威胁。,The individual's resistance to self-exposure and his emotional experience is to prevent the individual's self-awareness and self-esteem from threatening.
3737,也有些行为主义心理学家把阻抗理解为个体对于其行为矫正的不服从。,And some behaviorist psychologists understand the impedance as an individual's disobedience to their behavioral corrections.
3738,我试着让艾米做了一个练习，让她通过呼吸放松的方式让自己平静下来，去感受那份煎熬。,"I tried to let Amy do an exercise, let her breathe through the way to calm down and feel the torment."
3739,而一旦离开那个被困住的情境，她感觉自己放松下来，重新获得了自由。,"And once he left the trapped situation, she felt relaxed and regained freedom."
3740,现年63岁的流浪者韩某与另一流浪汉肖某酒后发生争执，遂持刀将其扎死。,The current 63-year-old wanderer Han and another tramp Xiao had a dispute after alcohol drinking. Then Han stabbed Xiao to death with a fruit knife.
3741,韩某称案发前他和流浪汉肖某都住在东城区一胡同内的地上，两人相距20多米。,"Han said that before the incident, he and the tramp Xiao lived in one lane of Dongcheng District. The two were just 20 meters apart."
3742,韩某称，案发当天，他俩被朋友叫去一起喝酒，两人在吃饭时和饭后曾两次发生争执。,"Han said that on the current day of the crime, the two were asked to drink alcohol. And the two had two disputes during and after meal."
3743,韩某称，他怕肖某打他，就从垃圾堆捡来一把水果刀，将其扎死。,"Han said that he was afraid that Xiao may hit him, so he picked up a fruit knife from the garbage pile and stabbed him to death."
3744,庭上，被害人家属要求韩某赔偿丧葬费、死亡赔偿金等共计53万余元。,"At the court, the victim's family asked Han to compensate for a total of 530,000 yuan in the form of funeral expenses and compensation for death."
3745,Uber进入台湾市场4年，对当地传统出租车行业产生了不小的冲击。,"4 years after Uber joined the Taiwan market, it caused no small impact on the local traditional taxi industry."
3746,台湾《联合报》8月12日消息称，12日上午逾百辆出租车绕行台湾“行政院”以示抗议，导致周边出现严重交通瘫痪现象。,"According to the information of Taiwan ""United Daily News"" on August 12, more than 100 taxies bypassed Taiwan Executive Yuan for protest. This resulted in serious traffic paralysis in the surrounding area."
3747,台北市司机工会理事长郑力嘉却表示，Uber来台4年，台当局这月底才召开会议，司机们已无法再等。,"It has been four years since the arrival of Uber in Taiwan, but the authority just launched the meeting at the end of this month. Drivers cannot wait any more, said Zheng Lijia, the chairman of Taipei Driver Union."
3748,然而政府言而无信，一拖再拖。,"However, the government eat their words and delayed again and again."
3749,属于底层劳工的守法出租车司机，却要与违法却不受限制的Uber竞争，感到被当局欺骗。,"The law-abiding taxi drivers, who are at the bottom of the society, had to compete with the unrestrained Uber and felt deceived by the authorities."
3750,原标题：江苏一养殖场2000只鸡被法院查扣场主擅自变卖获刑,"Original title: The Owner of A Jiangsu Farm Was Punished Because He Disposed of The 2,000 Chicken Without Permission Which Were Checked And Detained By The Court"
3751,判决生效后，因李某没有自动履行判决确定的义务，王某向沭阳法院申请强制执行。,"After the verdict comes into effect, because Lee did not automatically fulfill the obligation to determine the verdict, Wang apply for enforcement to the Shuyang court."
3752,2014年10月16日，沭阳法院作出民事裁定，裁定对李某所有养殖场内蛋鸡2000只予以扣押，未经允许不得转移、变卖。,"On October 16, 2014, Shuyang court made a civil ruling, and ruled that all of the 2,000 farm laying hens shall only be seized and shall not be transferred and sold without permission."
3753,李某在收到扣押裁定后，在未经沭阳法院许可的情况下，私自将该养殖场内被扣押的部分蛋鸡卖掉。,"After Lee received the detention ruling, without the permission of the Shuyang court, he privately sold partial egg laying hens."
3754,至2015年3月8日沭阳县公安局勘查时，养殖场内只剩蛋鸡142只。,"Until March 8, 2015 when Shuyang County Public Security Bureau conducted a survey, there were only 142 layers on the farm."
3755,记者8月12日获悉，北京2022年冬奥会和冬残奥会组织委员会发布公告表明，北京冬奥组委继承北京冬奥申委会徽、标志等知识产权。,"On August 12, reporters was informed that the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and the Winter Paralympic Organizing Committee issued a notice that the Beijing Winter Olympic Organizing Committee inherited the emblem and signs of Beijing Olympic Winter Games for commercial purposes."
3756,未经北京冬奥组委许可，任何人不得将北京冬奥申委会徽、标志用于商业目的。,"Without the permission of the Beijing Winter Olympic Organizing Committee, no one shall use the emblem and signs of Beijing Olympic Winter Games for commercial purposes."
3757,国家发展改革委产业协调司负责人今天在此间指出，钢铁产能过剩是全球性问题。,The head of the Department of Industrial Coordination of the National Development and Reform Commission said that iron and steel overcapacity is now a global problem.
3758,我国近年产能利用率均高于全球平均水平，也高于美欧等国家和地区。,"China's capacity utilization in recent years is higher than the global average, but also higher than that of the United States and Europe and other countries and regions."
3759,我国已经采取坚决有效的措施化解过剩产能，而且成效正在逐步显现。,"China has taken resolute and effective measures to resolve excess capacity, and the results are gradually emerging."
3760,该负责人指出，对钢铁产能过剩这一全球性问题，党中央国务院高度重视。,The official pointed out that the CPC Central Committee and State Council should attach great importance to the global problem of iron and steel overcapacity.
3761,各部门、各地区积极贯彻落实国务院部署，认真开展工作，今年要压减粗钢产能4500万吨左右。,"All departments and regions should actively implement the deployment of the State Council, earnestly carry out the work, and reduce crude steel production capacity by 45 million tons this year."
3762,从我国国情出发，我国并不鼓励钢材出口，相反，还采取一系列切实措施控制钢材出口。,"From China's national conditions, China does not encourage steel exports. On the contrary, it also takes a series of practical measures to control steel exports."
3763,这位负责人强调，钢铁产品国际贸易本质上讲是市场行为，是源于进口国需求、消费者综合考虑产品性价比等因素后的自主选择。,The person in charge stressed that the international trade of iron and steel products is essentially a market behavior and an independent choice from the requirement of importing countries and after considering the product cost and other factors.
3764,实施贸易保护措施无助于从根本上解决全球钢铁产业的发展问题，相反，只会对国际贸易秩序造成进一步冲击。,"The implementation of trade protection measures does not help to fundamentally solve the global steel industry development issues. On the contrary, it will only cause further impact on the international trade order."
3765,在谈到债务时，该负责人强调，化解债务问题是化解过剩产能过程中需要妥善处理好的重要问题。,"When it comes to debt, the person in charge stressed that the resolution of the debt problem is to properly handle the important issues that need proper handling."
3766,由于钢铁企业资产规模大，涉及面广，一些企业的债务关系复杂，如果处置不当，有可能引发区域性风险。,"As the iron and steel enterprises are large-scale and involve a wide range of enterprises, the debt relationship is complex. It may lead to regional risks if disposed of improperly."
3767,据该负责人介绍，近年来，随着经济下行压力加大，社会总需求逐步减弱，部分行业产能利用率下降，企业生产经营困难加大。,"According to the person in charge, in recent years, with the economic downward pressure to increase, the total social demand gradually weakened, part of the industry capacity utilization decreased and enterprise production and management difficulties increased."
3768,一些企业不适应市场环境变化，生产经营难以为继甚至濒临倒闭，但受一些体制机制因素制约，以市场化方式退出的障碍较多，成为“僵尸企业”。,"Some enterprises do not meet the changes in the market environment and the production and management is difficult to sustain or even on the brink of collapse. But restrained by some institutional factors, they become ""zombie enterprises"" due to many obstacles to the market."
3769,这类企业的存在，扭曲了市场信号，降低了要素资源利用效率，增加了社会管理成本，妨碍了公平竞争市场环境的建立。,"The existence of these companies distorted market signal, reduced the elements resources use efficiency, increased the cost of social management, thereby hindering the establishment of market environment with fair competition."
3770,导致亏损的主要原因与全球钢铁行业面临的困境一样——市场需求不振、产能利用率低。,The main reason for the loss is the same as the dilemma faced by the global steel industry - weak market demand and low utilization rate.
3771,我国主要采取市场机制、经济手段和法治办法，政府主要是做好职工兜底和社会稳定工作，保证公平公正的市场秩序。,"China mainly adopts the market mechanism, economic means and the rule of law. The government is mainly to do the work of disclosing the ins and outs to workers and social stability, to ensure fair and equitable market order."

Chinese tourists waved with surprise, and the local people and foreign tourists cannot help but to stop looking back."

3775,莫斯科旅游警察在红场、尼科利斯基步行街、古姆百货商场等地分成三个小组执勤巡逻，中国旅游警察一起跟岗学习，整个过程持续了一个多小时。,"Moscow travel police are divided into three groups for duty patrol in the Red Square, Nicolieski pedestrian street and Gu Mu Department Store. The Chinese tourist police also followed for study. The whole process lasted more than an hour."
3776,女警官柳希涅今年20多岁，通晓英语和西班牙语，她去年刚加入旅游警察队伍。,"Female police officer Liu Xinie is 20-plus years old, proficient in English and Spanish. She just joined the tourism police team last year."

3781,当天在跟岗学习前，中国旅游警察还到莫斯科市旅游警察大队驻地与他们的俄罗斯同行进行交流。,"On the current day before the study, the Chinese tourist police also went to the brigade station of Moscow city police to communicate with their Russian counterparts."
3782,“我常常与中国旅游者打交道，看到他们来到俄罗斯旅游非常高兴。”,"""I often deal with Chinese tourists and I am very happen to see them travel to Russia."""
3783,“他们通常求助的问题是：路怎么走，某个纪念碑在哪里，怎么打出租，怎么回到旅馆。”,"""Their usual questions are: where is xxx, for example, where is a monument, how to rent a taxi and how to return to the hotel."""
3784,莫斯科市旅游警察大队大队长雷萨科夫说，近年来莫斯科的城市环境和旅游氛围变得越来越好，对外国游客的吸引力日益增加。,"Lei Sakov, the brigade captain of Moscow city police said that in recent years, Moscow's urban environment and tourism ambience have become better and better, attracting more and more foreign tourists."

3792,中新网记者梳理发现，目前至少已有河北、吉林、天津、江西、四川、海南、甘肃、福建、北京等9个省市出台了居住证实施细则。,"Chinanews journalist found that there are at least nine provinces and cities issuing rules for the implementation of residence permit, including Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian and Beijing, etc."
3793,对于申领居住证的条件，上述地区普遍提出，需居住半年以上，符合有合法稳定就业、合法稳定住所、连续就读条件之一。,"For the conditions of applying for residence permit, the above regions generally said that the applicants need to live more than six months and meet one of these three requirements: having legitimate and stable employment, having legal and stable residence and continuous study."
3794,中新网记者注意到，在居住证提供的待遇方面，各地“含金量”不一，与国家版的规定相比，一些地区提供的公共服务和便利的范围有所扩大。,"Chinanews journalist noted that in the aspect of residence permit providing treatment, the ""gold content"" is different in various cities. Compared with the national provisions, some areas have provided more public services and conveniences."
3795,这些地区均增加了子女在满足相关条件下可在当地参加中高考的便利。,These areas have increased the conveniences of children to attend college entrance examination in the local place while meeting the related requirement.
3796,此外，北京等多地还明确要求，逐步扩大提供公共服务和便利的范围，并定期向社会公布。,"In addition, it is clearly proposed by Beijing and other places that they will gradually expand the scope of public services and convenience, and regularly release to the community."
3797,如，福建提出，至少每3年向社会公布一次居住证持有人享受的公共服务和便利的范围。,"For example, Fujian proposed to announce the public services and convenience of residence permit holders to the public at least every 3 years"
3798,《居住证暂行条例》规定，对符合居住证办理条件的，公安机关应当自受理之日起15日内制作发放居住证。,"""Residence Permit Provisional Regulations"" provides that, for those in line with the residence permit conditions, the public security organs shall issue a residence permit within 15 days from the date of acceptance."
3799,对于发证时限，大部分地区跟国家版的意见一致，即在15日内发放。,"For the time limit, most of the region hold the same opinion with the national version. That is, to release the permit within 15 days."
3800,河北明确，对符合申领条件、材料齐全的，居住地公安派出所应自受理之日起3个工作日内发放居住证。,"Hebei clearly stipulates that for applicants who meet the conditions of application and have complete application documents, the residence police station shall issue a residence permit within 3 working days from the date of acceptance."
3801,江西规定，符合居住证申领条件且证明材料齐全的，公安机关应当自受理之日起5个工作日内制作发放居住证。,"Jiangxi clearly stipulates that for applicants who meet the conditions of application and have complete application documents, the public security shall issue a residence permit within 5 working days from the date of acceptance."
3802,按照《居住证暂行条例》规定，上述地区均明确，首次申领居住证，免收证件工本费。,"In accordance with the ""residence permit provisional regulations"", the above cities stipulate clearly that the cost of certificate production shall be exempted in case of initial application of residence permit."
3803,如，四川要求，各地公安派出所或者受委托的社区服务机构要严格执行核定的收费项目及收费标准，坚决禁止超范围、超标准收费或搭车收费。,"For example, Sichuan required the local police stations or commissioned community service agencies shall strictly enforce the approved fees and charges standard and resolutely prohibit over-range, over-standard fees or ride fees."
3804,经查，2016年7月27日，原赣州市定南县委书记陈阳霞到省纪委报到上班，担任党风政风监督室主任（副厅长级，试用期一年）。,"It was found that on July 27, 2016, Chen Yangxia, the former Ganzhou City Dingnan County Party Secretary came to the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection for reporting and serving as director of the CPC supervision room (deputy director-general, one year's probation period)."
3805,当晚饮用的红酒由黎友才个人提供，其他费用由刘某某个人承担。,The red wine at the dinner was provided by Li Youcai while other costs were borne by Liu.
3806,江西省纪委通报称，陈阳霞、程子亮等人在私人会所组织和接受吃请，违反了中央八项规定精神，触犯了党的纪律。,"Jiangxi Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection informed that Chen Yangxia and Cheng Ziliang, who organized and accepted dining invitation in private clubs, violated the spirit of the central eight provisions and the Party's discipline."
3807,博格巴上赛季在意大利杯中吃到两张黄牌，根据规则将自动禁赛一场。,"Last season, Pogba was punished with two yellow cards. He will be banned automatically according to the rules."
3808,虽然他已经转会回到了英超，但是英足总仍然将其累计禁赛顺延至英超赛场。,"Although he has transferred back to the Premiership, the Football Association Challenge Cup (FA Cup) still passes his accumulative suspension to FA Cup."
3809,如此一来，在8月14日客场迎战伯恩茅斯的比赛中，博格巴将作壁上观，他重返曼联的首秀将延至20日与南安普顿的主场比赛。,"In this way, on August 14, in the away games of fighting against Bournemouth, Pogba will watch a fight without helping any party. His first show after return to Manchester United will be extended to Southampton's home game on August 20."
3810,作为2014年的首轮12号新秀，萨里奇将在下赛季正式登陆NBA，并加盟费城76人队。,"As the No.12 new arrival of the first round in 2014, Salic will officially land on the NBA in the next season, and join the Philadelphia 76ers."
3811,萨里奇身为一个年轻的欧洲球员，很多球迷对他并不是很了解，但是通过本届奥运会，相信萨里奇的表现给人们留下了很深的印象。,"As a young European player, Salic is not known to many fans. But I believe he impressed people with his performance in this Olympic Games."
3812,上一场克罗地亚险胜西班牙的比赛，萨里奇在最后时刻成功封盖掉保罗-加索尔试图将比赛拖入加时的篮下进攻。,"In a game with win by a narrow margin of Croatian over Spain, Salici successfully blocked Paul - Gasol in his last moment and tried to drag the game into the overtime basket attack."
3813,近日，76人队主帅布雷特-布朗给予萨里奇很高的评价，这位马刺系主帅认为他在萨里奇看到了年轻时的马努-吉诺比利的影子。,"Recently, Brett-Brown, the commander-in-chief of the 76-team gave Salic a high rating. He thought he saw the shadow of young Manu-Ginobili in Saric."
3814,很显然，萨里奇已经展现出了他的天赋，并且让76人对他充满期待。,It is quite obvious that Saric already showed his gift and made 76 people full of expectations.
3815,克罗地亚在本届奥运会上的前两场比赛，萨里奇一共得到24分、17个篮板和12次助攻。,"In Croatia's first two games of the Olympic Games, Salic received a total of 24 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists."
3816,上半场，萨里奇展现出了他在场上拉开空间的能力，通过与队友的挡拆之后，他在三分线外能命中投篮。,"In the first half, Salic showed his capability of drawing space on the scene. He can have a shot outside the three-point line via the pick and roll with his colleagues."
3817,虽然目前这支76人的内线囤积了不少有天赋的年轻球员，但是他们并不具备萨里奇的外线能力。,"Although the current 76-team is packed with many gifted young players, they are not equipped with the outside scoring capability as Salic."
3818,从盖帽到发动长传快攻并完成助攻，当今NBA赛场上能做到这点的内线球员屈指可数。,"From block shot to launching a long pass, fast break and complete assists, there are just a few insiders who can do it on the NBA game."
3819,自从本届奥运会开始以来，萨里奇在3场比赛里场均得到13分、8个篮板和5次助攻，表现堪称全面。,"Since the beginning of this Olympic Games, Salic has obtained 13 points, eight backboards and five assists in three games, with a full performance."
3820,自从2014年夏天决定重返骑士队以来，詹姆斯连续签了两份1+1的合同。,James has signed two 1 + 1 contracts since he decided to return to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014.
3821,随着NBA现今这份劳资协议即将进入最后一年，作为NBA球员工会的副主席，詹姆斯将会身处劳资协议谈判的最前线。,"Now, as this labor agreement is about to enter the last year, James will be in the forefront of labor negotiations as the vice chairman of NBA player union."
3822,鉴于联盟收入的大幅提升，这得感谢新的电视转播协议，以及老板和球员之间关于如何处理这笔钱的争斗，外界担心NBA将会在明年夏天陷入停摆。,The substantial increase in union revenue is attributed to the new television protocol. The question is how the boss and players deal with the money. The outside world is worried that the NBA will fall in the next summer.
3823,但是对于詹姆斯来说，他在明年夏天不用担心自己会成为自由球员，因为他已经与骑士队续约了一份3年期合同。,"But for James, he will not have to worry that he will become a free agent next summer because he has renewed a 3-year contract with the Cavaliers."
3824,无论2017-18赛季从什么时候正式开始，詹姆斯都是在合同之内的。,"No matter when the 2017-18 season kicks off, James is within the contract."

3829,在外观方面，nubiaZ11mini采用了一块5英寸的1080P屏幕，正面下方依旧是经典的“小红圈”设计。,"In appearance, nubiaZ11mini uses a 5-inch 1080P screen. The classic ""little red circle"" design is below on the front side."

3831,波特兰冶炼厂的未来因供电合同的取消而充满不确定性,Portland smelter's future in doubt with axing of power contract
3832,由于为工厂供电的电力公司透露了一名工厂所有人将终止一份供应合同，从而使所有供应合同失效，位于维多利亚的波特兰铝冶炼厂以及工厂数百名工人目前正面临着不确定的未来。,"The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant's owners is to terminate a supply contract, with all supply contracts expected to be axed."
3833,这一举措发生在维多利亚政府决定不继续发放保证工厂运营的补贴之后。,The move follows the decision of the Victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation.
3834,这笔为期20年的固定补贴将在11月终止。,A 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.
3835,美铝公司波特兰工厂的2000名工人可能面临失业。,Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
3836,一旦工厂关闭，可能有多达2000人直接或间接失业。,As many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure.
3837,并且由于该工厂的用电量占到维多利亚全部电力输出的约10%，因此可能还会产生连锁反应。,And there could be additional knock-on effects since the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of Victoria's entire electricity output.
3838,2014年，美铝公司关闭了汉瑞角冶炼厂，这导致了去年安格尔西岛发电厂的关闭。,"In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter which led to the closure last year of the Anglesea power plant."
3839,美铝公司波特兰冶炼厂目前正在亏损并且面临关闭风险。,Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and risks closure.
3840,此举是在对工厂未来几年作出预测之后作出的，最初的原因是澳元的走强，而最近则是因为工厂产品的价格。,"The moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now, initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant."
3841,AGL通过拉特罗布山谷老埃杨发电厂为这座大型铝冶炼厂提供电能。该公司预测另外三名工厂所有人也将终止其协议。,"AGL, which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements."
3842,工厂的最大股东是一家美铝公司和氧化铝公司的合资公司，而中国的中信集团和日本的丸红株式会社也持有少量股份。,"The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares."
3843,该合资公司表示：“AGL预计波特兰工厂将继续运营，也就是说这座冶炼厂将继续产生电力需求。”,"""AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, meaning physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue,"" it said."
3844,AGL表示这些合同是本来应该自2016年11月起生效的“对冲合同”。,AGL said the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016.
3845,合同的终止期为12个月，因此它们将在2017年终止。,The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017.
3846,该电力公司表示：“因此，AGL仍预测这些合同将在2017财年继续产生收入。”,"""As such, AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17,"" the power company said."
3847,自2018财年起对AGL可能产生的任何收入影响目前都受到期货市场对于批发电价的乐观展望。,Any potential earnings impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
3848,AGL表示，公司已在“终止活动预期”中减记了1.87亿美元的合同价值。,"AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in ""anticipation of a termination event."""
3849,美铝公司表示，决定终止这些合同“不会影响美铝公司经营该冶炼厂或保证该冶炼厂电力供应的能力”。,"Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts ""does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter."""
3850,这家美国公司表示其在2010年与老埃杨签署了一份为期20年的合同，该合同本来将在今年11月生效，但该公司没有解释为何退出该合同。,"The US company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract."
3851,分析家对于位于维多利亚的波特兰冶炼厂以及位于纽卡斯尔附近的托马戈工厂是否会因为行业糟糕的经济形势而关闭持谨慎态度。,Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the Portland smelter in Victoria and also the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economics of the industry.
3852,针对分析师在本周早些时候发表的评论，AGL运营主管史蒂芬·米克尔森表示波特兰每年的用电量达到约600兆瓦，托马戈工厂达到约900兆瓦。,"Addressing analysts earlier in the week, AGL's head of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts."
3853,如果两家工厂关闭，则电力市场的需求量会大大减少。,If both of those plants go from the market that's a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
3854,他表示：“作为一家电力公司，这对于我们来说可不是一个好消息”。,"And as a generator that wouldn't be good for us,"" he said."
3855,社区法律中心每年将16万人拒之门外,"Community legal centres turn away 160,000 people a year"
3856,每年有超过16万最弱势的群体被社区法律中心拒之门外。这项服务的资金本已捉襟见肘，而现在又要面对进一步的资金削减。,"More than 160,000 of the nation's most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year, with the sector bracing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on already-stretched operations."
3857,在昆士兰，每五个人中有三个人在寻求免费法律咨询和代理服务时被拒，其中大部分是老年人、移民、弱势的工人、暴力事件的受害人以及没有资源对抗不公正驱逐的人等。,"In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation."
3858,社区法律服务的资金缺乏早已超过了限值，现在又要面临进一步的资金削减。,"Community legal services, already stretched beyond limits, are bracing for further cuts."
3859,自明年六月起，联邦政府为这些法律中心提供的资金将再减少30%。,"From June next year, those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding."
3860,昆士兰社区法律中心负责人詹姆斯·法雷尔表示，根据最新的国家社区协会法律中心调查报告，每年有数千人被拒之门外。,Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year.
3861,法雷尔先生表示，如果联邦政府不改变现有的决定，这一情况只会变得更糟。,"Mr Farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision, the situation was only going to get worse."
3862,他表示：“昆士兰的社区法律中心长期处于资金不足的状况，这意味着数千人将无法获得所需要的重要服务。”,"""Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need,"" he said."
3863,需要远离暴力的人、背负无法偿还的巨额债务的人、面临分崩离析的家庭、被压榨的工人，这些人群都面临着法律层面的问题，并且该报告显示他们无法获得所需要的帮助。,"People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they're not able to get the help they need."
3864,联邦政府将自2017年6月起再削减30%的资金，这意味着昆士兰数千弱势群体将被迫在没有帮助的情况下面对复杂的法律问题。,"The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means thousands more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help."
3865,我们呼吁司法部长兼昆士兰议员乔治·布兰迪斯立刻撤消这些削减资金的决定，让人们可以在面对法律问题时获得所需要的帮助。,"We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they need when they're faced with a legal problem."
3866,去年，州政府承诺将法律援助资金提高到国家平均水平。,"Last year, the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average."
3867,现在必须关注社区法律中心及其对应社区的需求，白乐琪政府也必须投入到这项重要的工作中。,"It's now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communities, and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work."

3871,博迪尼表示，之前他希望这件事情能够在内部解决，但在等待了数月后他意识到“这不可能发生”。,"Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising ""this was not going to happen."""
3872,根据博迪尼的描述，这位名叫厄尔·菲利普的负责人“拔出了一把手枪，将右手食指放在板机上，并且将枪口对准文森特的膝盖骨。”,"The director, Earl Phillip, ""produced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent's knee cap,"" Bordini said in the complaint."
3873,在向当地和地区竞选团队领导层投诉后，博迪尼从卷宗中了解到至少还有四个人经历了相同的事情。,"After complaining to local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with Phillip, according to the filing."
3874,博迪尼在投诉中表示：“没有开枪不代表不会造成伤害。”,"""Guns don't have to fire to inflict damage,"" Bordini said in the complaint."
3875,就在该案件发生两天前，这位共和党总统候选人在北卡罗来纳州告诉群众，如果他的对手希拉里·克林顿当选并且挑选她所喜爱的法官，那么“支持第二修正案的人”，也就是枪支持有人和枪支爱好者可能会采取行动，这一发言引发了众怒。,"The suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in North Carolina that the ""Second Amendment people"" -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges."
3876,特朗普的竞选团队表示，媒体对他的话断章取义，他并没有提倡暴力。,Trump's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn't advocating violence.
3877,博迪尼在投诉中要求竞选团队为自己的疏于监督进行赔偿，同时也要求菲利普为自己的袭击、殴打和精神伤害进行赔偿。,"Bordini's complaint seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision, and from Phillip for assault, battery and infliction of emotional distress."
3878,特朗普发言人霍普·希克斯未立即对这一消息予以回应。,Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.
3879,无法联系到菲利普。,Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
3880,据夏洛特当地的一家新闻社WCCB报道，菲利普于近期离开了竞选团队。,"WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported Phillip recently left the campaign."

3885,希思罗也将为我们的社区、伦敦以及整个国家带来活力与繁荣。,"Heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London, but across the country."
3886,对于我而言，这是希思罗的魅力所在，正如在2012年伦敦奥运会时，我们竭尽全力保证我们的国家和地区能够从这些赛事中获益。,"For me, this was the great attraction of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games."
3887,奥运会使斯特拉特福德和东区受益匪浅。,The Olympics achieved huge benefits for Stratford and the East End.
3888,并且我们将通过为希思罗附近的当地民众和企业创造机会再次造福这一地区。,"And, we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to Heathrow."
3889,"仅就我们的本地社区而言，我们将创造10,000个新学徒岗位、40,000个新工作岗位并且让机场周围的年轻人摆脱失业困境。","For our local communities alone we'll create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport."
3890,正如2012年伦敦奥运会前，有些人认为希思罗的扩建工程过于庞大。,"Just as there were ahead of London 2012, there will be those that think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great."
3891,我被告知英国将无法为奥运会做好准备，并且我们将在全世界面前丢脸。,I was told that Britain would be never be ready for the Games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage.
3892,质疑者对于2012年奥运会的怀疑是错误的，并且他们对于希思罗项目的怀疑也将被证明是错误的。,The doubters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on Heathrow.
3893,虽然总是会出现需要克服的障碍，但希思罗正在解决每一个所面临的问题。,"There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow is answering every question asked of it."
3894,如同奥运会，希思罗是为大多数人而非少数人所开展的基础设施项目。,"Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few."
3895,扩建工程将创造多达18万个新工作岗位、带来2110亿英镑的经济增长，为机场周围和全英国留下一笔技术与就业财富。,"Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK."
3896,我们有一支出色的希思罗项目团队。该团队已准时并且在预算范围内完成了110亿英镑的基础设施投资项目，包括连续五年当选全球最佳机场航站楼的T5航站楼和位于全球最繁忙的两条跑道之间的T2航站楼。,"We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget, from T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's busiest two runways."
3897,现在，他们准备以160亿英镑的私人投资建设第三条跑道。,"Now they stand ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment."
3898,英国成功地举办了2012年伦敦奥运会，而我相信希思罗机场扩建项目也将取得巨大的成功。,The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too.
3899,现在正是我们传递奥林匹克精神并扩建希思罗机场的好时机，这样我们就能为我们的未来保驾护航并且创造一笔使全英国感到骄傲的技术与就业财富。,"It is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of."

3901,一名女性在瑞士高速公路上自杀并被辗身亡,Woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide
3902,受害者于午夜躺在高速公路上。,The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
3903,这名试图自杀的女性于周四清晨在高速公路上被多辆车辗过。目前警方正在寻找目击者。,Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suicide.
3904,这场事故发生在周四凌晨沃州莫尔日附近的A1高速公路上。,The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
3905,沃州警方表示，一名女性在深夜“绝望地”躺在公路上并且被多辆车辗过。,"A woman lay down in the dark on the road ""in a desperate act"" and was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement."
3906,受害者为一名49岁的瑞士女性，其行为明显带有自杀意图。她被多辆车辗过，其中包括一辆货车。,"Clearly looking to kill herself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles including a lorry."
3907,这名女性当场死亡。,She died at the scene.
3908,警方透露，多名涉事的驾驶员已接受了调查，但部分驾驶员仍未确认。目前警方正在呼吁他们以及事故目击者前来接受调查。,"Several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed but some are still unidentified, said police, who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward."
3909,吉勒斯·霍夫施泰特尔律师向《日内瓦论坛报》表示，目前已开始进行刑事调查，这是此类事件的常规流程。,"A criminal investigation has been opened, a ""logical"" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve."
3910,但目前尚未知晓是否将有驾驶员面临指控。,However it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges.
3911,是否有可能避免碰撞？,Was it possible to avoid impact?
3912,霍夫施泰特尔表示：“这将由检察官来确定”。,"That's what the prosecutor must determine,"" said Hofstetter."
3913,根据过去五年另两起类似案件的结果，驾驶员将不承担责任。,Two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
3914,据该报报道，这两起案件都是因为有人在深夜走上高速公路所引起的。最终的判决是驾驶员不可能预料到在午夜有行人会穿越高速公路。,"In each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, said the paper."
3915,去年，一名警官被指控因疏忽而致人死亡，指控的内容是2014年8月，她在帕耶讷附近的A1高速公路上撞击了一名男子并且致其死亡。,Last year a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
3916,法庭得知，这名22岁的受害者在饮酒后穿过公路。,"The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court heard."
3917,法官在调查后表示，这名女警察当时的驾驶行为完全合法，而这名男子出现在公路上“完全是意外且无法预料的情况”，而且这名女警察事后拨打了急救电话。,"The court found that the policewoman -- who was responding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a ""completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,"" the judge said."
3918,任何可提供有关周四莫尔日附近这起事故的信息的人应拨打021 644 83 46或 021 644 44 44联系警方。,Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
3919,NASA 气候模型：金星上曾适合人类居住,NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
3920,根据 NASA 新气候模型的预测，金星上曾适合人类居住。,"Venus was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model."
3921,NASA 戈达德太空研究所的科学家开发了一个可探索金星过去情况的模型，该模型所使用的工具和算法与气候科学家所使用的十分类似。,Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists.
3922,该模型用于确定表面高温、无水并且大气层充满二氧化碳的金星是否曾经有类似于地球的环境。,"The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions."
3923,此前，科学家认为金星自转速度较慢是因为其大气层较厚。,Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
3924,但最新的模拟表明金星可能曾经有一个较薄、类似于地球的大气层而且当时的自转速度同样较慢。,"But the latest simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly."
3925,该模型还能显示金星早期的地形。,The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
3926,金星的干燥地区可能比地球多，但曾经有足够的水和地理变化来孕育生命并且防止快速蒸发。,"The planet likely featured more dry regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation."
3927,早期，照射在金星上的阳光亮度比地球暗了30%。,Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.
3928,戈达德太空研究所科学家安东尼·德尔·杰尼奥在新闻发布会上解释说：“在戈达德太空研究所的模型模拟中，金星缓慢的自转使其一侧的白天时间长达近两个月。”,"""In the GISS model's simulation, Venus' slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time,"" GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release."
3929,这使表面变暖并且产生了能够形成厚云层的雨水，厚云层就像是一把伞一样为地面阻挡了大部分太阳的热量。,"This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating."
3930,模拟的结果是金星的平均气候温度实际上比现在的地球还低了几度。,The result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's today.
3931,该模型所模拟的金星演化与之前行星科学家推测的相近。,The model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.
3932,尽管金星上可能曾经存在生命，但在几十亿年的过程中，金星暴露在过高的温度与紫外线下。,"Though likely once habitable, Venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light."
3933,星球上的海洋蒸发，水蒸汽也被紫外线烧尽。,Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
3934,随着氢的逃逸，所留下的只有较厚的二氧化碳大气层和致命的温室气体效应，从而形成了我们今天所知道的金星。,"As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the Venus we know today."
3935,研究人员在《地球物理研究通讯》期刊中发表了新的金星气候模型的模拟结果。,Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
3936,帕特里克·罗伊辞去雪崩队主帅一职,Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
3937,帕特里克·罗伊于周四辞去科罗拉多雪崩冰球队主教练兼副总裁一职，他表示自己在球队决策层面没有发言权。,"Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of a voice within the team's decision-making process."
3938,科罗拉多执行副总裁总经理乔·萨奇斯确认了这一消息并且表示俱乐部将立刻开始寻找新的主教练。,Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new coach immediately.
3939,五十岁的罗伊在声明中表示：“在过去三年中，我怀着活力、激情与决心履行科罗拉多雪崩队主教练兼副总裁的职责。”,"""For the past three years, I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination,"" the 50-year-old Roy said in the statement."
3940,我在整个夏季认真思考了该如何改进这支球队，使其具备更上一层楼的实力。,I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.
3941,为此，这位主教练和副总裁的目标必需与俱乐部的目标相一致。,"To achieve this, the vision of the coach and VP-hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization."
3942,他还必需在影响球队表现的决策中拥有发言权。,He must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team's performance.
3943,但目前，这些条件还未满足。,These conditions are not currently met.
3944,萨奇斯于2013年5月23日聘请罗伊，他对罗伊为球队做出的贡献表示感谢。,"Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team."
3945,萨奇斯表示：“帕特里克在今天告诉了我他的决定。”,"""Patrick informed me of his decision today,"" Sakic said."
3946,我们对他为俱乐部所作出的贡献表示感谢，并且希望他在未来一帆风顺。,We appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.
3947,罗伊在2013-14年执教雪崩队的首个赛季中被提名为杰克·亚当斯奖联盟最佳教练。,Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's best coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
3948,他帮助俱乐部获得了112分，位居中部分区第一。但科罗拉多队在季后赛第一轮就被明尼苏达队所淘汰，在最近两年均与季后赛失之交臂。,"He guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division, but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years."
3949,2015-16赛季，雪崩队的成绩为39胜39平4负，最终以5分之差失去了西部大联盟赛区的第二张外卡资格。,The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.
3950,作为名人堂守门员，罗伊共赢得过四座斯坦利杯，在为蒙特利尔加拿大人队和雪崩队效力时各获得两座。,"A Hall of Fame goaltender, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two apiece with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche."
3951,北海油田工人停止罢工，继续谈判,"North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike"
3952,首席谈判代表表示，北海油田的工人停止了关于薪酬的罢工，此次纠纷的各方开始了新一轮的谈判。,"Labor strikes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, lead negotiators said."
3953,荷兰皇家壳牌经营的北海石油平台上出现了多次针对油田服务公司 Wood Group 的罢工。,Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
3954,根据一份联合声明，“Wood Group 以及 Unite 和 RMT 工会可以确认我们已同意重启当前纠纷的解决进程。”,"""Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute,"" a joint statement read."
3955,我们将从下周早些时候开始，在未来几周举行多场全天会议，重新审视这些问题。,"We will hold a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the issues."
3956,工会表示其近期采取的行动是为了抗议最高可能达到30%的减薪，而这也是工会25年以来首次采取这一行动。,"The labor unions said their recent action, which they said is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent."
3957,Wood Group 今年因市场压力而将北海承包商的报酬降低了约9%。,Wood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures.
3958,此次减薪前，该公司在2014年将海上承包商的报酬降低了10%。,The company's rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
3959,公司表示，再次减薪将帮助公司度过市场萧条的难关。,The company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn.
3960,壳牌已裁减了数千名员工并且宣布计划关停10个国家的油气设备，这是因为公司在与英国能源公司英国天然气集团合并后需要精简其业务。,"Shell, for its part, has trimmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group."
3961,能源公司正在面临来自原油价格下降以及英国六月脱欧决定的压力。,"Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union."
3962,苏格兰议会成员戴夫·安德森在本周早些时候与工会领导人会面，共同探讨北海这一代人最大的劳动纠纷。,Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the North Sea in a generation.
3963,他表示，北海对于地区经济而言至关重要。,"The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy."
3964,戴夫在声明中表示：“在北海和整个国家，我们需要一种服务于多数人而非少数人的经济。”,"""In the North Sea and right across the country, we need an economy that works for the many and not just the few,"" he said in a statement."
3965,2016年，北海新项目的支出预计不超过14亿美元，而过去五年的平均项目支出达到约70亿美元。,"Less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared with an average of around $7 billion in the past five years."
3966,开普勒测量昂宿星团恒星的自转速度,Kepler measures spin rates of stars in Pleiades cluster
3967,这项开普勒太空望远镜的最新使命帮助天文学家采集了最完整的昂宿星团恒星自转速度。,The latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.
3968,新数据正在帮助天文学家了解为何该星团的恒星有不同的自转速度以及自转周期与星球组成的关联。,"The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation."
3969,帕萨迪纳加州理工学院红外处理分析中心研究科学家卢萨·雷布尔在新闻发布会上表示：“我们希望通过比较我们的结果与其他星团进一步了解恒星质量、年龄、甚至其太阳系历史之间的关系。”,"""We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system,"" Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release."
3970,昂宿星团距离地球445光年。,The Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from Earth.
3971,该星团中的许多恒星诞生于约1.25亿年前，目前还刚刚达到成年期。,"Many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching adulthood, having been born roughly 125 million years ago."
3972,它们达到了一生中最高的自转速度。,They're spinning as fast as they ever will.
3973,在达到最高自转速度时，这些成熟的恒星射出大量恒星风。,"At their peak spin rates, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind."
3974,当这些恒星风穿过恒星的磁场时，它们会对恒星产生制动作用。,"As these winds travel across the stars' magnetic fields, they enact a braking effect on the stars."
3975,随着恒星年龄的增加，其自转速度开始减慢。,"As a star ages, its spin rate begins to slow down."
3976,开普勒通过追踪可识别的恒星黑子（如同太阳黑子）出现的时间测量各恒星的自转速度。,Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots.
3977,最新的自转速度数据集表明质量较大的恒星的自转速度慢于质量较小的恒星。,The latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.
3978,雷布尔将恒星比作舞者，体型较大的舞者旋转时的速度慢于体型较小的舞者。,"Rebull likens the stars to dancers, larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones."
3979,雷布尔表示：“在昂宿星团的‘芭蕾舞表演’中，我们发现自转速度较慢的恒星往往质量较大，而自转速度最快的恒星往往是最轻的恒星。”,"""In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive, whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars,"" said Rebull."
3980,由于昂宿星团距离较近，因此可以作为比较恒星质量与自转速度的理想宇宙实验室。,"Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates."
3981,雷布尔表示：“昂宿星团为年轻与年迈恒星的双向旋转理论模型奠定了基础。”,"""The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older,"" said Rebull."
3982,关于恒星如何、何时以及为何减慢自转速度并且“收起自己的舞鞋”，我们仍有许多需要了解的知识。,"We still have a lot we want to learn about how, when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their 'dance shoes,' so to speak."
3983,雷布尔和她的同事在三篇新论文中详细阐述了他们对昂宿星团自转速度的最新分析。这三篇论文不久将发布在《天文学期刊》上。,"Rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers, soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal."
3984,南湖公园水域管理科科长郑建军介绍，南湖水底最深处超过10米，不了解情况下水者，很可能发生危险。,"According to Zheng Jianjun, the Management Section Chief of Nanhu Park Water Area, the deepest point of the South Lake is more than 10 meters deep. People who do not understand the situation of water are probably confronted with danger."
3985,“虽说南湖救援队非常专业，但仍希望广大划船的游客能穿上救生衣，在湖上不要做违规行动，安全游玩。”郑建军说。,"""Although the Nanhu Park rescue team is very professional, we still hope that the majority of rowing tourists can wear life jackets and stay away from illegal activities on the lake to play safely"" Zheng Jianjun said."
3986,围头村具有得天独厚的海洋环境，坐拥自然生态和人文生态两大休闲旅游资源。,"Wai Tau Tsuen boasts a unique marine environment, with two leisure travel resources including natural ecology and cultural ecology."
3987,“但是购买了小区车位的个别业主，怕这样做会影响自己的车位出租价格，也怀疑其他人存有私心，所以一直背后搞破坏，导致车位改造一事被搁置。”,"""However, several owners who bought the parking spaces in the community feared that this would affect the price of their parking spaces and doubted that others were selfish, so they had been plotting for bad things. This had shelved the parking space transformation. """
3988,对于番薯在何时由何人引进这一问题，学界的说法仍纷繁不一。,"As for the question about when the sweet potatoes are introduced and by whom, there are still many different versions in the academic community."
3989,在目前较为主流的观点中，番薯的引进主要有三条线路。,"In the current mainstream view, there are three major lines for the introduction of sweet potato."
3990,番薯引入的三条线路中影响最大、传播最广的，就是陈振龙由菲律宾引入福州。,"Among the three lines of introducing sweet potato, the introduction by Chen Zhenlong from Philippine to Fuzhou is the one with the greatest impact and largest communication."
3991,北京市社会团体管理办公室即日起将对社会团体会费统一收据使用情况开展专项检查。,Beijing Municipal Social Management Office will soon carry out special inspections on the use of unified receipts of social group membership fees.
3992,检查分为单位自查和重点抽查两种。,"Inspection is divided into two categories, unit self-examination and spot inspection."
3993,市社团办相关负责人介绍，本次检查范围包括2013至2015年度在市社团办领用社会团体会费统一收据的社会团体。,"Relevant person in charge of the municipal association said, the scope of the inspection covers social groups who received unified receipts of social group fees in the social mass organization between 2013 and 2015."
3994,里约奥组委在２０１２年制定的奥运传播战略中就曾说：“奥运会成功与否是由哪些在社交媒体分享故事的人们定义的。”,"""The success of the Olympic Games is defined by people who share stories in social media,"" said the Rio Olympic Organizing Committee while establishing the communication strategy of 2012 Olympic Games."
3995,而从本届奥运会的报道来看，各媒体在传播方式、产品形态、语言风格、新闻视角等诸多方面都较以往做了很大的改变。,"From the news reports of the Olympic Games, all media have made a lot of changes in the aspect of mode of transmission, product form, language style, news perspective and many other aspects."
3996,国际奥委会和世界各国的媒体从业者，看来都已经要迎接这一轮挑战了。,It seems that the International Olympic Committee and the media practitioners around the world will have to meet this round of challenges.
3997,8月11日，光大证券H股公开发售进入最后一天。有消息指出，招股前两日市场反应平淡。按照计划，其将于8月18日在港交所挂牌上市。,"On August 11, this is the last day for the open sale of Everbright Securities H shares. News went that the market response was not special for market of the previous two days. According to the plan, it will be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on August 18."
3998,国内一家券商分析师表示，东方证券在港基础并不算好，旗下资管业务才是东证所长。相比中银国际、中信证券等银行系券商，显得先天不足。,"A domestic brokerage analyst said that the Orient Securities in Hong Kong did not enjoy a good foundation. Only its capital management business is its strength. It has many inherent problems compared with Bank of China International and CITIC Securities, etc."
3999,专家指出，今年以来随着证券市场回归平淡，很多券商业绩都出现了下滑，但公司上市之后情况要更多看公司本身业务的发展情况，不能一概而论。,"Experts pointed out that with the return of the securities market to flatness, many brokers sagged this year in results. But the detailed situation of the listed companies is dependent on the detailed development of the corporate business and cannot be generalized."
4000,此项调控新政出台后，苏州将成为全国第一个重启限购的二线城市。,"After the introduction of the regulation of the new deal, Suzhou will become the first second-tier city to restart the purchase restriction."
4001,出台或者即将出台楼市调控政策的二线城市不止苏州，还包括合肥、南京等城市。,"In addition to Suzhou, other second-tier cities including Hefei and Nanjing will also introduce the property market regulation and control policies."
4002,此前，合肥已经率先发布限贷政策，对于在合肥名下有两套房且有一套住房贷款未结清的购房者，银行将拒绝提供房贷服务。,"Prior to this, Hefei has been the first to issue restrictions on lending policy. For people who have two suites in Hefei and have one housing loan not paid, they will be denied with the mortgage services from bank."
4003,必须坚持战斗力标准，要向能打仗、打胜仗聚焦。,as the criterion to meet in all its work and focus on how to win when it is called on.
4004,人们更要用自己的实际行动做好表率，让官兵按照十九大,"People should set a good example for the officers and soldiers with their actual deeds,"
4005,确立的强国强军目标，不断地提高自身能力素质和打赢本领，担当起党和人民赋予的新时代使命任务,"and guide them to constantly improve their capabilities and fighting abilities towards the goal of building a powerful nation and military established in the 19th CPC National Congress, and shoulder the great missions of the new era entrusted by the party and the people."

4326,特朗普的新任幕僚长计划限制总统的媒体时间,Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.
4327,其他人也曾尝试过，但均以失败告终。,Others have tried and failed.
4328,约翰·F·凯利也许真的能够做到。,Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
4329,如果真的如此，那他就是第一人。,"If so, he will be the first."
4330,据美国政治新闻网站 Politico 报道，新任白宫幕僚长计划限制流向特朗普总统的信息——包括新闻媒体报告——以期保证大老板更加平稳。,Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even keel.
4331,以下是摘自记者乔什·道西的一段话：,Here's a bit from reporter Josh Dawsey:
4332,“当新任白宫幕僚长约翰·F·凯利开始第一天工作与高级官员聚集讨论时，他指出他要解决特朗普总统入主白宫的一个主要问题：流向总统手中的不良信息”。,"""When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly huddled with senior staff on his first day at work, he outlined a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he planned to fix: bad information getting into the president's hands."
4333,凯利告诉这些官员，收到优良信息有助于总统作出更好的决定，因此信息才需要经他之手——无论以书面形式还是简报形式。,"Kelly told the staff that information needed to flow through him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if given good information."""
4334,凯利的诊断似模似样，但其他人也曾试图通过监视特朗普的媒体时间将其驯服，但最终都以失败告终。,"Kelly's diagnosis makes perfect sense, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet."
4335,特朗普总统的电视瘾由来已久——现在在白宫，他看电视的习惯仍然在加深。,"President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still going strong."
4336,二月份时，前竞选顾问山姆·那伯格告诉 Politico 称：“如果候选人特朗普对不公平报道感到沮丧，那么让他知道他在可信渠道也得到了正面报道将大有裨益。,"""If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable,"" Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February."
4337,Politico 的塔拉·帕尔梅里当时写到，“根据六位前竞选官员的经验，控制特朗普发推特的习惯的重点在于保证他个人接收的媒体信息中一直包含一定的赞扬。”,"Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that ""the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise."""
4338,这完全没问题。,Okay.
4339,但是特朗普的推特习惯曾经“受控”这个观点实在可笑。,"But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been ""under control"" is laughable."
4340,可能这些竞选官员知道某些我们不知道的事——那就是如果不是有他们的干预，特朗普的推特甚至会更加火气冲天。,Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.
4341,我们可能从来不知道特朗普没有发送的那些推特。,We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.
4342,如果他的职员能够救他于水火之中，哪怕只有几次，他们的努力也是值得的。,"If his staffers managed to him out of trouble even a few times, then their efforts were worthwhile."
4343,但是没人能够一直阻止特朗普引起争议。,But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.
4344,一部分问题在于在一个由相互竞争的集团组成的白宫中，人们通过向特朗普递交可能可靠也可能不可靠的资料来宣扬他们的世界观，花式推动他们的事业。,"Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing factions, people invariably try to advance their agendas by presenting Trump with material - which may or may not be reliable - that promotes their worldviews."
4345,Politico——都是关于这个故事——五月份报道了各顾问对向总统战略性提供可疑信息的嗜好。,Politico - all over this story - reported in May on advisers' penchants for strategically feeding dubious information to the president.
4346,这是记者谢恩·古德曼彻描述的一个例子：,"This was one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:"
4347,“现任与前任特朗普官员称，特朗普对负面新闻片段的反应如火山喷发，尤其是那些有破坏性的信息泄露，他会疯狂地想要找出其来源。,"""Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react volcanically to negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, becoming engrossed in finding out where they originated."
4348,二月底，有人恶意将网络煽动分子查尔斯 ·C·约翰逊的网站 GotNews.com 上的一篇文章复印给了总统，该文控诉副幕僚长凯蒂·沃尔什为白宫“大量信息泄露的来源”，当时特朗普就是这样的表现。,"That is what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being 'the source behind a bunch of leaks' in the White House."
4349,即使约翰逊已因骚扰遭推特永久封禁，也没有提供任何具体证据，而且他曾炸出大量错误质控，后来又都公然否认。,No matter that Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he had lobbed false accusations in the past and recanted them.
4350,特朗普看了文章然后开始向官员询问沃尔什的情况。”,"Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."""
4351,古德曼彻还说，当时的幕僚长雷因斯·普里巴斯和白宫秘书罗伯·波特“曾试图建立一个系统来管理并记录特朗普收到的文件”。,"Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter ""have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."""
4352,结果呢？,How'd that work out?
4353,凯利打算做同样的事，在三个月后。,"Kelly is trying to do the same thing, three months later."
4354,可能他能证明自己是比普里巴斯更有效率的管理者，但是特朗普还是那个冲动的特朗普，而他的助手仍在相互竞争，争夺影响力。,"Perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his aides are still vying for influence."
4355,这些永恒的影响因素会让凯利的任务难上加难。,Those immutable factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.
4356,旅游风情小镇：风情如何醉游人,Tourism charm town: How does charm mesmerize tourists
4357,[摘要]浙江小镇的潜力被逐步唤醒。,[Abstract] The potential of small towns in Zhejiang is gradually unleashed.
4358,如今这些小镇，成为赴浙游客欣赏浙山水、品读浙文化、感受浙乡愁的重要目的地，也将为我省着力打造“诗画浙江”中国最美旅游目的地提供重要助力。,"Today, these little towns have become key destinations for visitors to Zhejiang who come to admire the natural scenery, savor Zhejiang culture, and feel nostalgic about Zhejiang. They will also become key drivers to help the Province create “Picturesque Zhejiang”, China’s most beautiful tourist destination."
4359,胜在风情,Reputed for Local Custom
4360,“社戏锣鼓伴月升，腊肠香味随风飘。,"""Village theatrical performance is staged as the moon rises, while the pleasant smell of delicious sausage spreads with breeze."""
4361,”漫步绍兴安昌古镇，随处可见箍桶、竹编、打铁、纳鞋、挑花边、纺棉花等传统手工技艺，充分展现了安昌古镇的非物质文化遗产，四方游客陶醉在观赏体验绍兴民俗风情、领略绍兴历史文化积淀的氛围中。,"Walking through the Anchang Ancient Town in Shaoxing, you can see hoop buckets, bamboo knitting, ironmaking, shoes stitching, lace making, cotton spinning and other traditional handicraft techniques almost everywhere, which fully represent the intangible cultural heritage of the Anchang Ancient Town. Tourists all over the world are enchanted to experience the folk customs and feel the atmosphere of Shaoxing's historical and cultural experience."
4362,据悉，今年元旦三天假期期间，安昌古镇游客超过6.5万人次。,"It is reported that during the three-day New Year's holiday, more than 65,000 tourists visit Anchang Ancient Town."
4363,在浙江，像安昌古镇这样风情独特的小镇星罗棋布：嘉兴西塘的潋滟波光，流淌着江南水乡的温情婉约；衢州廿八都的白墙黛瓦，诉说着千年古镇的岁月沧桑；台州石塘镇的渔民画，勾勒出既传统又富有现代气息的渔家生活……这些的小镇是浙江旅游的“掌上宝”，亦是八方游客的“心头爱”。,"In Zhejiang, a town with a unique style such as Anchang Ancient Town is scattered all over like stars. The glittering waves of Jiaxing Xitang is flowing with the warmth and gratefulness of the lower reaches of the Yangze River in the south; the white walls of Quzhou's Nianbadu Ancient Town convey to us the changes over time in the town; and the murals of fishermen in Shitang, Taizhou draw a picture of their life, both traditional and modern. These towns are the ""palm treasure"" of Zhejiang tourism and also the favorites of tourists from all regions."
4364,近年来，随着我省全域旅游建设的推进，浙江小镇的潜力被逐步唤醒。,"In recent years, with the promotion of tourism construction throughout the whole region, the potential of Zhejiang’s small towns have been gradually awakened."
4365,在2016年，省政府办公厅正式发布了《浙江省旅游风情小镇创建工作实施办法》，提出通过5年左右的时间，在全省验收命名100个左右民俗民风淳厚、生态环境优美、旅游业态丰富的省级旅游风情小镇。,"In 2016, the provincial government office issued the ""The implementation of the creation of a tourist town in Zhejiang Province”, which proposed that the province would accept and name about 100 tourist towns with strong folk customs, beautiful ecological environment and rich tourism industries after 5 years or so."
4366,省旅游局相关负责人介绍，在旅游风情小镇的创建热潮下，现在我省各地乡镇更加重视个性化旅游产业的打造，新的旅游项目与业态层出不穷，为游客带来了丰富体验，赢得了良好口碑。,"The responsible people of the Provincial Tourism Bureau established that with the rise of these tourism style towns, we must now pay more attention to the construction of the personalized tourism industry and new tourism projects and formats emerging one after another. These have brought rich experiences to tourists and earned glowing reputations."
4367,重在推广,Emphasis on promotion
4368,近日，由浙江省旅游局、浙江日报报业集团主办，浙报集团旅游全媒体中心承办的“小镇×未来艺术家”分享汇暨“诗画浙江?镇有风情”2017浙江旅游风情小镇推广季闭幕式在浙江省展览馆举行。,"Recently, directed by the Zhejiang Provincial Tourism Bureau and Zhejiang Daily Press Group, the Tourism Full Media Center of the Zhejiang Daily Press Group hosted the “Towns × Future artists"" sharing session and the 2017 promotion season of Zhejiang style tourism towns, ""Poetic Zhejiang, Towns with folk customs”. The closing ceremony took place in the Zhejiang exhibition hall."
4369,“风情小镇有艺术之美、有生活温度。,“A style town has artistic beauty and living warmth.
4370,小镇的风情在于原汁、原味、原乡，一种原生态的纯粹。,"The style of the towns lies in the original sense, flavor and township, which represents the original purity."
4371,”中国美术学院影视动画艺术学院影视系老师、国内一线影视广告导演谢瀚锋，以及中国计量大学艺术与传播学院院长徐向纮教授等专家，讲述了《镜头中的小镇》《小村改建》等小镇跨界故事。,"Xie Hanfeng, a teacher at the School of Film and Television Animation Arts of China’s Academy of Art, the domestic A-list film and television advertising director, and Professor Xu Xianghong, the dean of the School of Art and Communication at China Jiliang University, talked about the cross-border stories of towns through Towns in the lens and Reconstruction of small village."
4372,浙江的众多风情旅游小镇都有深厚的文化资源，来自湖州市南浔的小镇代表董新建在现场为大家解读了国画南浔。,"Many scenic tourist towns in Zhejiang have deep cultural resources. Dong Xinjian, a town deputy from Nanxun, Huzhou, appeared in the site in person and interpreted Nanxun as a traditional Chinese painting."
4373,江南水乡风情自古颇受书画家的喜爱，如今，南浔古镇与中国美院等艺术院校开展深度合作。,"The style of towns in the south of the lower reaches of the Yangze River have been popular with painters since ancient times. Nowadays, the Nanxun Ancient Town is developing in-depth cooperation with art academies such as the China Academy of Art."
4374,旅游风情小镇必备风情要素、旅游要素、服务要素和环境要素。,"Tourism style towns must be equipped with elements of style, tourism, service and the environment."
4375,在这当中，旅游的服务设施和环境也是十分重要的内容。,"Among these, tourism service facilities and the environment are very important."
4376,下雨天如果递上一把及时伞，也能让游客更好地体验小镇的风情。,"If the tourists are handed in an umbrella on a rainy day, they can better experience the town’s style."
4377,在这个共享的时代，浙报集团旅游全媒体中心联手时下最热的共享雨伞公司定制了一批“诗画浙江”版的共享伞，希望倡导“共享?绿色”的理念，提升游客和小镇居民的文明旅游意识和公德心，共创共享美好的旅游环境。,"In the era of sharing, the Tourism Full Media Center of the Zhejiang Daily Press Group teamed up with the hottest shared umbrella company to customize a number of shared umbrellas in “Poetic Zhejiang” style, hoping to promote the concept of “Sharing and Green”, spread the awareness of civilized tourism and public morality among tourists and residents, and create a shared, beautiful tourist environment."
4378,这成为“诗画浙江?镇有风情”2017浙江旅游风情小镇推广季活动中的一个亮点。,"This has become a bright spot in the 2017 promotional season of Zhejiang’s tourism towns, ""Poetic Zhejiang, Towns with folk customs”."
4379,期待精彩,Expecting wonders
4380,截至目前，浙江省已经发布了首批21家省级旅游风情小镇创建名单和115家省级旅游风情小镇培育创建名单。,"Up to now, Zhejiang Province has released the list of the first 21 provincial-level tourism towns that will ultimately culminate in a grand total of 115 provincial tourism towns."
4381,作为乡村旅游“十三五”时期优先发展的重点区域，风情小镇将最终建成3A级以上旅游景区，成为旅游产品多样、旅游效益突出、产业融合共赢的新样板。,"As the prior area for the development of rural tourism during the “13th Five-Year Plan” period, the style towns will eventually be built into tourist attractions with a grade of 3A or higher, becoming a new model for tourism product diversity, tourism benefits and industrial integration."
4382,旅游风情小镇之所以吸引人，关键在于它的原汁原味。,What makes tourism style towns attractive is their authenticity and originality.
4383,旅游风情小镇之美，不仅源于烟雨迷蒙的小桥流水，也来自悠久文化传统；乡村振兴，源于文化自信。,"The beauty of the tourism style towns not only stems from the misty bridges and rivers, but also from a long history of cultural tradition; the revitalization of the country is due to cultural self-confidence."
4384,纵观国际，荷兰利瑟小镇、奥地利哈尔施塔特小镇、法国南瓜小镇，分别以郁金香、“盐”和南瓜为核心吸引物，每年吸引大量世界各地游客，实现旅游推助小镇经济腾飞。,"Throughout the world, the tulips of the Netherlands’ Lisse Town, the salt of Austria’s Hallstatt Town, and the pumpkins of Pumpkin Town in France, have been attracting a large number of tourists from all over the world each year. This has allowed the realization that tourism could help the economic growth of smalls towns as well."
4385,对于风情小镇而言，“突显特色、留住乡愁”的重点使小镇具有明显的个性和灵魂，更在于提供文化浸润、承载地方文脉、彰显乡土文明。,"For the style towns, the point “Emphasis on characteristics and retention of nostalgia” has given the towns a distinct personality and soul, further providing cultural permeation, carrying local cultural traditions, and highlighting native civilizations."
4386,旅游风情小镇，以文化和乡愁为纽带，以人文和风景为载体，联接着四方游客，让传统的风情和文化在共建共享中传承、创新。,"Tourism style towns, with culture and nostalgia as the link and humanities and scenery as the carrier, connect tourists all over the world while inherit and innovate the traditional customs and cultures in the co-construction and sharing process."
4387,从本质上讲，旅游风情小镇是一个复合型开放式的旅游景区，更应是当地居民和外来游客乃至旅居者共建共享的生活空间。,"Essentially speaking, the tourism style town is a complex open-style tourism area, and it should be a shared living space for local residents, exotic tourists and even sojourners."
4388,作为今后旅游业增长的主战场，旅游风情小镇不仅可能改变乡村生态面貌、经济社会发展方式、产业要素流动方向，更是消弭城乡基建鸿沟、唤醒乡村文化复苏的重要力量。,"As the main battlefield for tourism growth in the future, tourism style towns will change the rural ecological landscape, economic and social development patterns, and the flow direction of industrial factors. Additionally, they will play an important role in eliminating the urban-rural infrastructure gap, hastening rural cultural recovery."
4389,在乡村加速振兴的大潮中，浙江旅游风情小镇将演绎更丰富的精彩故事。,"In the wake of accelerating revitalization of the countryside, Zhejiang tourist towns will receive a more abundant and wonderful story."
4390,有数据显示，中国70%的出行需求集中在3公里范围内，以此而论，整个短途出行市场早晚是共享单车的天下。,"Figures indicate that 70% of China’s travel demand is concentrated within a 3km radius. On this basis, the short-distance travel market will become a bike sharing paradise sooner or later."
4391,《日本财经新闻》报道，称由于特朗普下一届政权的财政扩张政策，通货膨胀压力将加强，2017年的加息速度也将加快。,A report in “The Nikkei” claimed that inflationary pressure will increase because of the expansionary fiscal policies of the next Trump administration. The pace of interest rate hikes will also accelerate in 2017.
4392,一年一度的国际消费电子展（CES）于1月9日（北京时间1月10日）至12日在美国拉斯维加斯开幕。,"The annual International Consumer Electronics Show (CES), held between January 9 (January 10, Beijing time) and 12, opened in Las Vegas, USA."
4393,根据CES官方网站1月9日公布的参展商名单，第51届CES共有4577家各国企业参展。,"According to the list of exhibitors published by the official CES website, the 51st CES attracted 4,577 corporate participants from around the world."
4394,相对于每年卫视播出1.3万集电视剧的巨大产量，这些“腰斩剧”不过是沧海一粟。,"Compared to the massive 13,000 TV dramas broadcast by satellite TV each year, these “terminated dramas” are but a drop in the ocean."
4395,房车客对沟渠进行谈判，重返“富豪街”,"Travellers negotiate trench, return to 'Millionaire's row'"
4396,一些西米德兰兹地区最富有的业主与意志坚定的房车客再次发生争执，这些房车客就一条政府开掘的沟渠进行协商，要求归还豪宅之外的土地。,Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are again at loggerheads with determined travellers who have negotiated a council-dug trench to reclaim a field outside their mansions.
4397,房车客将他们的 20 辆拖车停在繁华的索利赫尔街之外的一片空地上，这条街被冠名为“富豪街”。,The travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull dubbed 'millionaire's row'.
4398,房车客们牵着着马匹，怀抱婴儿和率领房车车队，在五月份被赶走后再次回归，市政部门挖出的“护城河”并没有阻止到他们的进入。,"Bringing horses, babies and an army of vans, they have returned after being kicked out only in May, undeterred by a moat dug by the council to prevent their incursions."
4399,这支圆滑老练的队伍发现这道防御线有个缺口，尽管有一段路没有设置路障适合通过，但他们的车辆通过该缺口挤入。,"The tactful group found a gap in the defences, squeezing their vehicles though a section left unbarricaded to accommodate a pathway."
4400,愤怒的居民对索利赫尔委员会 (Solihull Council) 进行了猛烈的批评，称其“在处理这个问题时表现很差劲”。,Furious residents have savaged Solihull Council saying it was 'useless at dealing with the problem'.
4401,一位不愿具名的居民说：“他们是在周一晚上到那里的，之前来到宾利希思街，向过往的路人扔石块。,One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after being moved on from Bentley Heath where they were throwing rocks at passers by.
4402,该委员会应该对他们的作为感到羞耻，因为他们在处理问题上简直是一无是处。,The council needs to be shamed into action as they are useless at dealing with the problem.
4403,房车客们在五月份来到这里，随后被赶走了，现在他们又回来了。,"The travellers were there in May, were moved on and now they are back again."
4404,昨晚来了不少，今天可能会更多。”,"More arrived last night, probably even more today.'"
4405,她补充道：“伯明翰市议会知道如何通过实施长期禁令保护其公园的方式进行处理。,She added: 'Birmingham council knows how to deal with this by getting long injunctions to protect their parks.
4406,我住在斯珠茨布鲁克 (Streetsbrook) 路，如果议会不能阻止这样的事情，我可不愿意继续支付市政税。,I live on Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can't even stop this.'
4407,一位不愿透露姓名的当地居民说：“这太荒谬了，我们刚刚看到上一批房车客走了，只是便于另一批来毁坏。,"One local resident who did not wish to be named said: 'It is ridiculous, we have only just seen the last round of these travellers leaving, only to be blighted by another round."
4408,这次的数量又增加了，有人甚至看到公园草坪上有马在吃草。”,The numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen grazing on the parkland.'
4409,一位索利赫尔委员会的女发言人表示：“我们知道有人在斯珠茨布鲁克路的一片空地上进行未经许可的露营，现在我们配合索利赫尔警察工作，并采取必要的法律行动，让他们尽快搬离。,"A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised encampment on land off Streetsbrook Road and working alongside Solihull Police, we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible."
4410,为了支持我们收集证据，请尽可能多的当地居民通过致电 101 向警方报告任何反社会或犯罪行为，这一点非常重要。,To support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
4411,这有助于我们向法院提交案件时勾勒出情况概貌，供法院审视。”,This helps build a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to them.'

4428,意大利对非政府组织移民救援船采取强硬态度,Italy toughens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
4429,意大利向地中海经营移民救援船的非政府组织发出警告，如果不签署新的行动管理规范，他们将不得继续实施救援。,Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean they will not be allowed to continue if they do not sign up to new rules governing their operations.
4430,内政部长马可·明尼蒂在接受都灵日报《新闻报》采访时称：“如果非政府组织不签署新的行为规范，很难看出他们将何以为继。”,"""If NGOs do not sign up to a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue operating,"" Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa."
4431,在明尼蒂发出警告的前一天，意大利官方因怀疑德国援助组织“青年救助”一艘船上的船员实际上勾结人口贩子，协助非法移民而将其扣押。,Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities impounded a boat operated by German aid organisatiion Jugend Rettet on suspicion its crew effectively collaborated with people traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
4432,该援助组织仅运营一年，并拒绝评论意大利检察官安布罗吉奥·卡尔托西奥的具体指控主题。,"The aid organisation, which has only been operational for a year, declined to comment on the substance of detailed allegations made against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."
4433,该组织在一份社交媒体声明中称，“对我们而言，拯救生命现在是、以后也会是最重要的事，因此我们很遗憾目前不能在搜救区运营。”,"""For us the rescue of human life is and will be our top priority, so we are very sorry we will not be able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment,"" the organisation said in a statement on social media."
4434,“收集完所有信息后，我们目前只能评估所有指控和形势。”,"""We can only assess all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."""
4435,意大利官方从 10 月份开始就在监视“青年救助”组织的船 Iuventa 号。,"Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, the Iuventa, since October."
4436,其船员涉嫌搭载人口贩子直接由小船运送而来的移民，并允许走私者仓促逃离，重新利用船舰。,Its crew is suspected to taking on board dinghy loads of migrants delivered directly to them by people traffickers and allowing the smugglers to make off with the vessels to be used again.
4437,根据检察官的文件记录，据称至少有一宗此类会面在距利比亚海岸 1.3 英里的海上发生。该文件内容由意大利媒体发表。,"At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media."
4438,其船员涉嫌公然无视意大利海岸警卫队权威，该警卫队出于人道主义热情而非任何其他动机监督该地区的救援行动。,"The crew are suspected of having flouted the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone, out of humanitarian zeal rather than for any other motives."
4439,根据行为规范规定，Iuventa 等船只明显需要一名意大利警员在船上监督他们的活动。,"Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa would notably have to have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities."
4440,目前，在九个参与搜救行动的非政府组织中，只有三个已同意遵守行为规范，它们分别是：救助儿童会、总部位于马尔他的移民海上援助站和西班牙的 Pro-Activa Open Arms。,"Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms."
4441,后者于星期四称，其认为新规定虽没有必要，但可以接受，因为这些规定并不会对其救援行动带来任何“重大改变和阻碍”。,"The latter said on Thursday it regarded the new rules as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve any ""significant change or impediment"" to its rescue operations."
4442,拒绝签署的组织中有诺贝尔奖获奖组织无国界医生 (MSF)。,Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
4443,与此同时，明尼蒂称近几周抵达意大利的移民人数骤降，这表明加强利比亚海岸护卫以及联合各当地市长的努力已初见成效。,Minniti meanwhile said a sharp fall over recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following rescues was an indication that efforts to beef up the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors was bearing fruit.
4444,该部长称：“近几天来，我们开始在隧道尽头看到了曙光。“,"""In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel,"" the minister said."
4445,他公布了本月的深度会谈的计划：与各利比亚市长商讨经济发展活动，与乍得、尼日尔和马里商讨如何减少欲离开这些国家前往欧洲的移民人数。,"He revealed plans for further talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe."
4446,交通银行首席财经学家连平则表示，由于2017年前三季度工业增加值都出现季末上翘特点，预计12月工业增加值增长可能加快至6.6%。,"Lian Ping, Chief Economist of the Bank of Communications, said that as value added of industry for each of the first three quarters of 2017 was stronger toward the end of the quarter, the growth rate of value added of industry in December could accelerate to 6.6%."
4447,预计12月固定资产投资累计增速为7.2%，与上月持平，低于去年。,"Cumulative growth rate of fixed asset investment in December is forecast to be at 7.2%, unchanged from the previous month, but lower than that a year ago."
4448,工业生产虽然会弱于10月，但与11月基本持平。,"Industrial production, while weaker than that in October, will remain generally unchanged from that in November."
4449,而12月我国制造业投资低位运行，但基建投资有小幅改善，因此预计当月固定资产投资将持平于11月。,"Investment in China’s manufacturing sector was low in December, but infrastructure investment improved slightly. As such, fixed asset investment for the month will remain the same as that in November."
4450,福建长乐二十多万人进入美国，多为偷渡客；身在异国，归家无期，亲人离散，类似场景不断上演。,"Most of the more than 200,000 people from Changle, Fujian Province entered the US as illegal immigrants. Living in an alien country indefinitely, their families are separated and torn apart; similar scenes such these have continued to unfold."

4453,记者从仪式上获悉，为强化首都核心功能，治理“大城市病”，近几年来，在京津冀协同发展及疏解非首都功能背景下，北京加快推进中心城区高校向郊区疏解，一些高校的师生正陆续分批迁至顺义、大兴、房山等郊区新校区。,"Reporters learned from the ceremony that for the purposes of enhancing the capital’s core functions, and treating “large urban center diseases”, on the back of cooperative development among Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei Province as well as the shifting and relocation of non-capital related functions, Beijing has accelerated the program to shift and relocate institutions of higher learning situated in central districts to suburban districts in recent years. The teachers and students of some institutions of higher learning are relocating in batches to new campuses in Shunyi, Daxing, Fangshang and other suburban districts."
4454,北化工新校区位于昌平南口镇，占地1800亩，距离市区40公里，是北京市疏解非首都功能的重点工程之一。,"BUCT’s new campus is located in Nankou Town, Changping, and sits on a land area of 1,800 mu, some 40 km from the city. It is a key project of Beijing’s shifting and relocation of non-capital functions."
4455,新校区分三期建设，目前一期建设已全部完成，二期建设预计于今年底全面启动，全部建成后计划将满足近2万名本科生、研究生及教职员工学习和生活的需要。,"The new campus was constructed in three phases. Phase I is now entirely completely, and Phase II is expected to commence by the end of the year. On completion, the learning and living requirements of close to 20,000 undergraduate and graduate students as well as faculty staff are expected to be met."
4456,此时回望今年的电影市场时，我们发现，电影的原著文本及参演明星的两批拥趸，成为电影预期观众的重要组成部分。,"At this time, a review of this year’s film market will show that fans of the original book of a film adaptation and those of the actors taking part in film have become key components of the expected audience of the film."

4459,经初步侦查，起火的是储存四氢呋喃等化学物质的小储罐，现场产生浓烟较大。,Preliminary investigation revealed that the cause of the fire was the small tanks in which tetrahydrofuran was stored. There was thick smoke at the scene.

4464,卡特在 6 月被判处对康拉德?罗伊 (Conrad Roy) 犯有无故意非预谋杀人罪，后者于 2014 年 7 月 13 日自杀。,"Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014."
4465,罗伊的父亲在周四的听证会说道：“我的家人伤心欲绝。,"Mr Roy's father told Thursday's hearing: ""My family is heartbroken."
4466,我的儿子是我最好的朋友。”,"My son was my best friend."""
4467,在等待上诉期间，卡特获准保持人身自由。,Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal.
4468,她面临最多 20 年有期徒刑，但她的律师团认为她和罗伊先生都患有精神病。,"She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal team argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness."
4469,在宣判时，卡特站立着，身穿红色长裤和米色罩衫，双手紧扣，双眼含泪，目光朝下。,"Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood tearfully with hands clasped and eyes cast down as she was sentenced."

4474,但卡特的律师说这是“一个可怕的后果，她感到非常后悔。”,"But Carter's lawyer said it was a ""horrible circumstance that she completely regrets."""
4475,然而，劳伦斯?莫尼斯 (Lawrence Moniz) 法官说，他并没有发现她的“年龄或成熟程度，乃至她的精神疾病会对她的行为产生任何重大影响。”,"However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her ""age or level of maturity or even her mental illness have any significant impact on her actions."""
4476,一位检察官阅读了罗伊母亲林恩?罗伊 (Lynn Roy) 的一份声明她说，“我没有一天不为失去我心爱的儿子而痛心。,"A prosecutor read a statement from Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying there was ""not one day I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son."

4479,“失去一个从我出世以来就陪伴着我的人是一种痛苦，而我的余生将会与这种痛苦为伍。”她说道。,"""Not having that one person I've been with every day since birth is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life,"" she said."
4480,这个案例似乎开创了法律先例，因为马萨诸塞州的法律并没有规定怂恿其他人自杀有罪。,"The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no Massachusetts law that criminalises telling a person to commit suicide."
4481,2014 年，罗伊被发现死于车内一氧化碳中毒；这一年，卡特 17 岁。,Carter was 17 when Mr Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.

4485,莫尼兹法官说，卡特通过罗伊先生的死来博取关注，并命令她不得通过任何媒体从案件中获利。,"Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Mr Roy's death, ordering that she not be allowed to profit from the case through any press."
4486,本案例存在法律意见分歧。,The case has divided legal opinion.
4487,替卡特辩护的人为数不多，阿曼达?诺克斯 (Amanda Knox) 就是其中之一，她于 2007 年被指控在意大利谋杀她的英国室友，两年后被宣布无罪。,"Among the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was cleared two years ago."
4488,30 岁的诺克斯女士在《洛杉矶时报》发表的一篇专栏文章中表示：“米歇尔?卡特值得同情和帮助，而不是监禁。”,"Ms Knox, 30, published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times saying: ""Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."""

4522,在橘红色背景墙映衬下格外鲜亮的广告牌上，它们各自标出了不菲的价码。,"On the bright advertising board against a tangerine colored wall, they listed their respective exorbitant price tags."
4523,因此，中国电视剧制作产业协会决定，将联合全国电视剧制作行业，签署自律公约。,"Therefore, China Television Drama Production Industry Association will work together with the television drama production industry nationwide to sign a self-discipline convention."
4524,普罗旺斯薰衣草受到气候变化的威胁,Provence lavender under threat from climate change
4525,薰衣草已经成为法国南部普罗旺斯市的象征，但现在有个坏消息，它正受到气候变化带来的威胁。,"It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it's under threat from climate change."
4526,由于持续干旱和出现携带病毒的昆虫，薰衣草正在衰败，这让正在试图寻找解决方案的科学家和农民头痛不已。,"Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing a major headache for scientists and farmers attempting to find solutions."
4527,位于普罗旺斯的农业研究所 (CRIEPPAM) 的专家艾瑞克?蔡斯 (Eric Chaisse) 说：“普罗旺斯的薰衣草正面临着巨大的威胁，因为近年来该植物受到了气候变化的影响，春季降雨大幅减少，而秋季则阴雨绵绵。,"Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: ""Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less rain in the spring and mostly in the autumn."
4528,这会影响到薰衣草的生命周期。,This affects the lifespan of lavender.
4529,还有一种个体较小的蝉，一种可以传播微小细菌的叶蝉，在非常干燥的天气中，它们会大量出现。“,"There's also a small cicada, a micro-bacteria transmitting leaf hopper, and in very dry weather there are lots of them."""
4530,关键在于其数量巨大。,And a lot is at stake.
4531,清雅的薰衣草场除了可以吸引度假者外，薰衣草油还受到香水和化妆品行业的追捧。,"As well as attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is highly sought after for perfume and cosmetics."
4532,艾瑞克?蔡斯说：“与可以开许多大花，具有很长谷穗的植株相反，我们的则存在个体较小，发育不良、缺失或孱弱不足的问题。,"Eric Chaisse said: ""Instead of having very long plant ears with a number of large flowers, we have smaller ones, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened."
4533,所以我们的精油含量更少。”,"So we have fewer parts with essential oil."""
4534,正在研究的解决方案包括采取更好的灌溉技术和减缓土壤水分的蒸发，向植株上喷洒粘土和水的保护性混合物，以及开发更为耐旱的品种。,"Solutions being looked at include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties more resistant to dry conditions."
4535,相比起电影中的科幻元素，两位主演纷纷表示更吸引他们的是影片中的故事。,"Compared to the sci-fi elements in the movie, the two lead actors said that it was the movie’s plot that attracted them."
4536,9月5日下午，华西都市报记者，连续采访多位相声界的知名人士，还有两位相声表演艺术家，令人吃惊的是，他们几乎保持一致沉默。,"On the afternoon of September 5, West China City Daily reporters consecutively interviewed numerous renowned personalities in the cross talk circle, as well as two cross talk artistes. What was surprising was that they were unanimously silent most of the time."
4537,一位是柏林影帝，一位是上升期青年演员，《心理罪》也是廖凡和李易峰的首次搭档。,"One is a Silver Bear Best Actor, the other, an up-and-coming young actor; “Guilty of Mind” is the first partnership between Liao Fan and Li Yifeng."
4538,墨西哥危险重重，新闻记者被杀,A journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico
4539,《Riodoce》周报的全体员工通常都会在周三集会，回顾他们对锡那罗州骚乱的报道计划，这些骚乱由犯罪组织、腐败官员和无尽的毒品战争引起。,"The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meets on Wednesdays to review their plans for coverage of the most recent mayhem wrought in Sinaloa state by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars."
4540,但是今天，悲剧的阴影笼罩着他们自己，他们汇聚一堂讨论安全问题。,"But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they've come together to talk about security."
4541,他们被告知要改变他们的日常习惯，这很重要。,"It's important to change their routines, they are told."
4542,两名资深记者讨论了哪种更让人感到安全：究竟该把他们的孩子带到办公室（办公室曾在 2009 年遭到手榴弹袭击），还是该把他们留在家里。,"Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home."
4543,安全专家在房间前面的黑板上写下了三个单词：敌人、中立者和盟友。,"Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies."
4544,他们让这些记者在每一栏下列出名字——不需要证据，观察和直觉就够了。,"They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough."
4545,有怀疑在政府名单上的毒贩、政客、商人和记者，或者卡特尔，这帮恶棍让墨西哥的报道工作危险重重。,"There are drug-traffickers, politicians, businesspeople, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of villains who make the job of covering Mexico's chaos perilous."
4546,暴力从不停歇，全国尸横遍野，其中有越来越多记者：根据保护记者委员会的记录，自总统恩里克·培尼亚·涅托于 2012 年 12 月上位以来，已经至少有 25 名记者死亡；589 名记者在遭到袭击与威胁后受联邦保护；今年目前为止，有至少 7 名记者在 7 个州内死去。,"There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more of them are journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven dead in seven states."
4547,上一个死去的是他们的编辑和灵感来源，同时也是《Riodoce》的联合创始人哈维尔·瓦尔迪兹·卡德纳斯。,"Among the latest is their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."
4548,瓦尔迪兹写过很多关于毒品暴力的书籍，他在其中一本中这样写道：“最大的错误就是住在墨西哥并成为一个记者。”,"""The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist,"" Valdez wrote in one of his many books on narco-violence."
4549,大家能够深切感觉到他已经离开，虽然他无处不在——一张巨大的照片挂在《Riodoce》办公楼的正面，瓦尔迪兹竖着中指，配词“正义”；亚伦·伊瓦拉和米里亚姆·拉米雷斯这两位 30 多岁的记者穿的 T 恤上还展示着他的笑容，他戴着眼镜或他标志性的巴拿马草帽。,"His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez displaying his middle finger, with the word ""Justice,"" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building; two reporters on their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that display his smiling, bespectacled face or his trademark Panama hat."
4550,研讨会在他去世后不到两个月的时间召开；记者们纷纷讨论他们共同的创伤、噩梦、失眠和多疑症。,"The workshop takes place less than two months after his death; the reporters discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia."
4551,虽然 2010 年成立了一个特殊的联邦检察官办公室来处理记者案件，但是根据保护记者委员会的记录，该办公室只起诉了两人。,"Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists' cases, it has only prosecuted two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists."
4552,每年数千宗犯罪案件中大部分都涉及贩毒与组织犯罪，所以很少能将杀害记者的凶手绳之以法。,"As with most of the thousands of murders tied to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice."
4553,在《Riodoce》，他们坚持报道锡那罗州的暴力事件，虽然他们已经心碎，虽然这片土地已千疮百孔。,"At Riodoce, they persist in covering the violence of Sinaloa, though they are heartbroken, though the terrain is more treacherous now."
4554,伊瓦拉说，没有凶手信息，没有伸张正义，那么召开安全讨论会也没多大用。,"Without information on the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security, says Ibarra, is of little use."
4555,他说“浪费时间参加这样的研讨会真是愚蠢。,"""It's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop,"" he says."
4556,只要我们不知道为什么，你就不相信任何人。”,"""As long as we don't know why, you distrust everyone."""
4557,5 月 15 日早晨，瓦尔迪兹离开首府库利亚坎的《Riodoce》办公室。,"On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan."
4558,他的红色丰田卡罗拉只开出了几个街区就被两个男人拦住；他们逼迫他下车，开了 12 枪，猜测是因为报纸的名字——翻译为《十二道河》。,"He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of the paper - which translates as Twelfth River."
4559,歹徒开着他的车离开，并在附近将其撞毁。,The gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
4560,瓦尔迪兹 50 岁了。,Valdez was 50 years old.
4561,留下他的妻子和两个已经成年的孩子。,He left a wife and two adult children.
4562,库利亚坎流言四起。,Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
4563,但是关于瓦尔迪兹的话题，实际上除了沉默什么也没有。,"But on the subject of Valdez, there's practically nothing but silence."
4564,自从去年古兹曼被捕并于 1 月份引渡美国，锡那罗州已经成为这个国家最血腥的战场，各敌对势力疯狂厮杀。,"Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum."
4565,锡那罗州的街道上每天都有一个或几个人被枪杀，墓地里布满了毒枭华丽的两层陵墓，这些已经司空见惯。,"Never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, larger than many homes for the living."
4566,暂时忘记“平静”的状态是只有一个卡特尔控制这个海滨州及其通往美国的港口和贩毒路线的时候。,"Forget for a minute that a state of ""calm"" is when just one cartel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug-trafficking routes to the United States."
4567,即使如此，即使瓦尔迪兹深刻知道这份工作的危险性，但 60 岁的《Riodoce》联合创始人兼董事伊斯梅尔·波荷奎还是因为没有保护好他的朋友而愧疚不已。,"Despite that, and the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the perils of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is wracked with guilt for failing to protect his friend."
4568,他相信两个错误造成了这次悲剧。,He believes two errors contributed to the killing.
4569,第一，2 月份出版了达马索·洛佩兹采访，他领导着一个与古兹曼几个儿子对战的卡特尔集团。,"First there was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons."
4570,这份报道可能激怒了这几个儿子；报纸一送到报摊就被嫌疑帮派成员买断。,The piece may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newsstands.
4571,第二个错误是在另一份报道同一个故事的报纸被没收后没有强迫瓦尔迪兹为自身安全考虑离开墨西哥。,The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that carried the same story.
4572,瓦尔迪兹在墨西哥及国外是一个传奇，他的死对墨西哥针对记者的暴力具有重大意义。,"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."
4573,他的精神长存，他的朋友和同事相信他一直与我们同在。,"He'd survived for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there."
4574,2003 年他还是《Noroeste》的资深记者，当年他联合了五位同事创办了《Riodoce》，卖了 50 美元的股份。,"He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating Riodoce, selling $50 shares."
4575,波荷奎说，在锡那罗州，“踏足新闻业不可能不跟毒品问题打交道。”,"In Sinaloa, ""it was impossible to do journalism without touching the narco issue,"" said Bojorquez."
4576,随着时间的流逝，该报因大胆诚实的报道赢得了不错的声誉，销量和广告也增加了。,"Over time the paper earned a reputation for brave and honest coverage, and sales and advertising increased."
4577,记者喜欢能够发表直击要害的调查报道而不用担心审查，读者也喜欢报纸发表其他人不敢报道的故事。,"Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories nobody else dared to cover."
4578,《Riodoce》在创办五年后获得了拉美国家玛利亚摩斯卡波新闻奖。,"Eight years after Riodoce was founded, it won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for coverage in Latin America."
4579,同年保护记者协会授予瓦尔迪兹国际新闻自由奖，表彰他追求最真实的墨西哥毒品报道的勇气。,"That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug story wherever it led."
4580,他坦言自己也很害怕。,He freely acknowledged that he was frightened.
4581,在保护记者协会授予奖项的时候，他说“我想要继续活下去。”,"""I want to carry on living,"" he said at the time of the CPJ award."
4582,后来在 10 月份下旬，他在当地电视台 Rompeviento TV的一次采访中称“在锡那罗州，贩毒是一种生活方式，,"Drug trafficking in Sinaloa ""is a way of life,"" he said last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV."
4583,你必须以记者的身份承担落到你肩上的任务——要么如此，要么装聋作哑。,"""You have to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play dumb."
4584,我不想被问道‘面对这么多死亡，你做了什么......为什么你不对正在发生的事发声？’”,"I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so much death ... why didn't you say what was going on?'"""
4585,《Riodoce》的全体员工都很怀念瓦尔迪兹，怀念他像一个码头工人一样咒骂不休，怀念这位从不吝惜拥抱与建议的朋友，怀念这位知道如何活下去的老师。,"The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the jokester who swore like a longshoreman, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."
4586,他们依赖于他的习惯。,They relied on his routine.
4587,他过去常常戴着那顶帽子。,He would always wear his hat.
4588,常去办公室对面的那家 El Guayabo 酒吧，也总是坐在同一张桌子上。,"He would go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and would always sit at the same table."
4589,现在，他们会问：是他的日常习惯造成了他的陨落吗？,"Now, they ask: Was his love of routine his downfall?"
4590,他的死也让他们不得不去思考如何做好工作并好好活下去的问题。,His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
4591,波荷奎说，“他们不喜欢你给他们的女人和孩子惹麻烦，也不喜欢你影响他们的合法公司和用于运送毒品的秘密机场。,"""They don't like it if you mess with their women, their children, their clean businesses, their clandestine airstrips"" used to move drugs."
4592,这些都越过了他们的底线。”,"""Those things were off-limits,"" said Bojorquez."
4593,结果是，即使在最安全的时候，也要保持高度的自我审查和自我保护。,"The result is, even in the best of times, a high-level of self-censorship and self-preservation."
4594,相信自己的直觉。,Trusting one's instincts.
4595,如果你嗅到了危险的气息，赶紧远离。,"If it smells wrong, stay away."
4596,《Riodoce》编辑安德烈斯·维拉里尔说，问题是“气息是一种会被欺骗的感觉......然后就会发生哈维尔那样的事。”,"The trouble, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that ""smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with Javier happened."""
4597,他和其他人都说以前的规则已不再适用于锡那罗州——就像已经不再适用于塔毛利帕斯州、韦拉克鲁斯州、格雷罗州和其他州一样，这些州的走私路线利润丰厚，而各机构势微，政府官员腐败，乌烟瘴气。,"The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials."
4598,局势在不停地变换。,The landscape constantly shifts.
4599,在《Riodoce》员工参加安全培训的房间里，突然就不允许使用手机；几天前，据称仅出售给政府的间谍软件在墨西哥已经用于监视记者和活动分子。,"In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed; days before, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."
4600,外面，两名警察在树荫下乘凉，躲避 104 度（40 摄氏度）的高温。,"Outside, two police officers sought relief from the 104-degree (40 Celsius) heat in the shade of a tree."
4601,他们是州政府派来保护《Riodoce》的办公室的，这些办公室位于库利亚坎中层阶级街区一栋四层楼高的大楼里。,"They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's offices, housed in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan."
4602,一些记者半开玩笑地调侃道不知道这些警察会不会就属于州长自己说的那信不过的 50%。,"Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 percent of cops whom the governor himself has said are not trustworthy."
4603,记者们去山区已经几个月了，那里的贩毒集团处于实际存在的控制之下。,"It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountainous countryside, where the drug gangs are in de facto control."
4604,这周的《Riodoce》主要报道了三件大事。,For this week's edition Riodoce was looking at three main stories.
4605,其中有锡那罗州伟大的前拳击手胡里奥·塞萨尔·查韦斯的兄弟被杀事件，,There was the killing of former boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
4606,还有州长家乡的政府经费披露，,They also had an expose on government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
4607,以及库利亚坎一家昂贵的餐厅内的绑架事件，这家餐厅距离检察官的办公室只有一个街区。,"And there was a group kidnapping in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office."
4608,官方并没有发布被绑架对象和绑架过程的信息，因此写下这个城市都知道的事情时需要慎之又慎：那就是这家餐厅是毒贩和官方都爱去的地方。,"There was no official word on who was abducted or how it happened, so caution set in when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite of both drug traffickers and authorities."
4609,一位记者从公共档案得知该餐厅登记在执政党革命制度党 (PRI) 一位政客名下，该党几乎在整个上个纪都主宰着各个政治阶层。,"A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, which dominated all levels of politics for nearly all of the last century."
4610,最近，几位革命制度党州长在几宗受高度重视的案件中被指贪污。,Recently several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
4611,维拉里尔要求记者写一写之前在事发地点发生的事，包括墨西哥头号大毒枭古兹曼的一个儿子躲避军事袭击的事件。,"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that locale, including one in which a son of ""El Chapo"" Guzman escaped a military raid."
4612,如果在几个月前，读者们会查看瓦尔迪兹的专栏，寻找对此次绑架事件最有力的信息。,"Just months before, readers would have looked to Valdez's column for the best-sourced information about the kidnapping."
4613,46 岁的维拉里尔因为身材单薄，人称“瘦子”，他说“在以前，我们早就已经知道发生了什么事。,"""Before, we would have already known what happened,"" said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed ""El Flaco"" for his slender build."
4614,现在我们所有的信息来源沟通渠道都被掐断。,"""Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."""
4615,瓦尔迪兹的办公室现在被用来储藏抗议杀害记者的标识和贴纸，因为员工们成为了他们从没想要成为的样子：代表媒体的积极分子。,"Valdez's office has been repurposed as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting journalist killings, as staff have become something they never expected to be: activists on behalf of the press."
4616,第二天早上记者米里亚姆·拉米雷斯随手抓了一把标识走出房间，前往当地检察官的办公室参加与另一位记者相关的游行。,Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office over yet another journalist.
4617,萨尔瓦多·阿达梅在瓦尔迪兹被杀三天后在西部的米却肯州失踪。,Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
4618,官方发现了一具被烧焦的尸体，并称根据 DNA 测试，这就是他的尸体。,"A burned body has been discovered and officials say it is his, based on DNA tests."
4619,在全国范围内，记者们都变得更加直言不讳，他们组织抗议，在人行道和建筑物上涂上“拯救媒体”的字样。,"Nationwide, journalists have become more vocal, scrawling ""SOS Press"" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests."
4620,这一天，董事波荷奎并不在华盛顿，他正努力为瓦尔迪兹案伸张正义，争取国际支持。,"On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case."
4621,瓦尔迪兹被杀的第二天，在与锡那罗州州长的会面中，拉米雷斯控诉官方刺探记者信息，并因为他们说出了事实而将他们杀害。,"At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth."
4622,鉴于她的愤怒已经影响她的客观性，她也要求辞去报道政府事务的职位。,"She has since asked to be reassigned from covering the government, concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity."
4623,瓦尔迪兹曾不断重申，墨西哥的记者被组织犯罪、同流合污的政府官员和漠不关心的社会“包围”着。,"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are ""surrounded"" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society."
4624,在他的上一本书《毒品新闻业》中，他写道，记者不仅仅被贩毒集团残害，更是在与组织犯罪同流合污的政客和安全部队的名单上。,"In his last book, ""Narco-journalism,"" he wrote that reporters are being killed not just by drug gangs but on the order of politicians and security forces in cahoots with organized crime."
4625,媒体监察集团 Articulo 19 就将去年超过一半的记者袭击归罪于警方和公共官员。,The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.
4626,拉米雷斯说，“在墨西哥，他们让你死就为了让你闭嘴。”,"""In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up,"" Ramirez said."
4627,显然，这些谋杀案令人不寒而栗。,"Clearly, the murders have a chilling effect."
4628,没有人忘记六年前，博主玛丽亚·伊丽莎白·马西亚斯死在了塔毛利帕斯北部的边界。,No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
4629,她的尸体旁有一张据称由泽塔斯卡特尔签署的字条：“我为我的报道而来。”,"Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: ""Here I am because of my reports."""
4630,她的头颅被割下，旁边放着一个电脑键盘和耳机。,A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
4631,，米罗斯拉娃·布雷奇在 3 月被杀后，一些报业选择关闭，比如奇瓦瓦州北部边界的《El Norte》报纸。,"Some outlets have opted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the killing of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March."
4632,其他人还在继续，2014 年《El Manana of Nuevo Laredo》的董事被杀，但他们还在继续。,"Others keep going, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did following the killing of its director in 2004."
4633,2010 年，Diario de Ciudad Juarez 用一条头版新闻公开对话毒品卡特尔，其标题为“你们想从我们这里得到什么？”,"In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with a front-page editorial titled, ""What do you want from us?"""
4634,部分记者逃离了他们的家乡，或者甚至离开了这个国家。,Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
4635,这是一个艰难的抉择。,It's a wrenching decision.
4636,流亡中很难找到工作，而且他们在街道上仍需小心谨慎，警惕危险。,"It's hard to find work in exile, and they still scan the streets, looking for danger."
4637,有时他们会被捕，据说在 2015 年摄影师鲁本·埃斯皮诺萨在逃离韦拉克鲁斯三个月后在一个墨西哥城市和四名女性一道被杀。,"And sometimes, they are hunted down, as apparently was photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz."
4638,对于那些待在幕后继续工作的人来说，这是高危决策的日常舞步。,"For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance of high-risk decisions."
4639,伊瓦拉曾想要成为诗人，他承认报道毒品贸易让他感到恐惧。,Ibarra - who once wanted to be a poet - admits that covering the drug trade scares him.
4640,他说“墨西哥正在变成地狱，所以我成为了一名记者。”,"""Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter,"" he said."
4641,最近一个星期五的半夜，最新一期的报纸已经付印，《Riodoce》的编辑们坐在办公室外的走道上喝着啤酒，突然，他们的手机响了。,"At midnight on a recent Friday, with the latest issue already put to bed, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer, when all at once, their phones began to buzz."
4642,海滩度假城市马萨特兰附近的帮派敌对势力和安全部队发生一系列枪战，已确认 19 人死亡。,A series of shootouts involving gang rivals and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
4643,战事还在升级，正如该地区发现的一系列卡特尔信息预示的那样。,"The war continued to escalate, as was promised by a series of cartel messages discovered in the area."
4644,他们就在路边通过手机把新闻上传到《Riodoce》的网站上。,"From the curb, via cellphone, they put the news up on Riodoce's website."
4645,第二天的头条不得不更改了。,The front page would have to be changed the next day.
4646,警笛声在附近响起——该地区又发生一起生死决斗的枪战。,Sirens wailed nearby - another shootout in the area.
4647,波荷奎瞥了一眼站在那里护卫的警察，看他们是否警觉起来。,Bojorquez glanced over at the police officers standing guard to see if they were alert.
4648,如果他们有丁点害怕，那么他们也并没有表现出来。,"If they were at all afraid, they didn't show it."
4649,这份报纸的创始人已经阵亡，在他的大幅肖像画上，他的中指指向了整个锡那罗州需要眺望的地方，《Riodoce》的全体职员跟随着他的步伐。,"Beneath the massive portrait of their newspaper's fallen founder, his middle finger displayed for all of Sinaloa to see, the staff of Riodoce was following in his footsteps."
4650,波荷奎说：“你怎么可以甚至想要关闭呢？哈维尔被杀的同一天，实习生要求我把她派到街上参与报道。”,"""How can you even think of closing,"" Bojorquez said, ""when the same day Javier was killed the intern asked me to send her out to report on the street?"""
4651,中国自驾车旅游2020年市场规模或突破万亿元,Size of China’s self drive tourism market may exceed RMB1 trillion by 2020
4652,[摘要]在消费升级和自由行盛行的大背景下，自驾游受到国家政策的鼓励以及越来越多消费者的喜爱。,"[Abstract] Against the general backdrop of consumption upgrading and widespread popularity of free-and-easy travel, self drive tourism has received support from national policies, and is welcomed by an increasing number of consumers."
4653,但与此同时，有望突破万亿规模的自驾游市场却也面临着双重挑战。,"At the same time however, the self drive travel market, the size of which is expected to exceed RMB1 trillion, is confronted with twin challenges."
4654,在消费升级和自由行盛行的大背景下，自驾游受到国家政策的鼓励以及越来越多消费者的喜爱。,"Against the general backdrop of consumption upgrading and widespread popularity of free-and-easy travel, self drive tourism has received support from national policies, and is welcomed by an increasing number of consumers."
4655,但与此同时，有望突破万亿规模的自驾游市场却也面临着双重挑战，一方面自驾游产业的发展与市场需求不成正比，自驾游俱乐部以及旅行社等自驾游组织者面临着盈利微薄的困境；另一方面，自驾游所面对的基础设施和服务也还处于初级阶段。,"At the same time however, the self drive travel market, the size of which is expected to exceed RMB1 trillion, is confronted with twin challenges. On the one hand, the development of the self drive travel industry is out of step with market demand. Self drive travel organizers such as self drive clubs and travel agents are confronted with meager profits. On the other hand, self drive travel ae confronted with infrastructure and services that are still in their infant stages."
4656,占国内游总人次60％，市场规模有望破万亿,"Accounting for 60% of total tourists in domestic tourism, with market size expected to exceed RMB1 trillion"
4657,2016年全年国内旅游44．4亿人次，自驾游占据国内旅游总人次的60％左右，到2020年自驾游市场规模有望突破万亿。,"In 2016, domestic tourism numbered some 4.44 billion persons, with self drive travel accounting for approximately 60% of total tourists in domestic tourism. By 2020, the size of the self drive travel market is expected to exceed RMB1 trillion."
4658,据中国旅游车船协会对自驾车出游人数的统计情况来看，近五年来自驾出游人数持续增长，出游人数占国内旅游人数比例稳定在半数以上。,Statistics concerning the number of persons engaged in self drive travel published by China Tourism Automobile And Cruise Association showed that the number of persons engaged in self drive travel has continued to grow over the last five years. The share of such tourists as a proportion to domestic tourists has stabilized at above 50%.
4659,与此同时，各地区以及国家层面对自驾游这一新兴领域表现出了更多的关注和扶持，2016年到2017年，与自驾车、旅居车和露营旅游有关的政策法规密集出台。,"At the same time, all regions as well as the State have shown greater concern and support for self drive tourism, this new emerging sector. From 2016 to 2017, a slew of policies and regulations relevant to vehicles for self drive travel, and motorhome and camping tourism have been promulgated."
4660,2017年7月，国家旅游局、国家体育总局等八部门联合发布了《汽车自驾运动营地发展规划》；同月，发改委、财政部等14个部门联合印发的《促进乡村旅游发展提质升级行动方案（2017年）》中，自驾游被重点提及。,"In July 2017, eight government agencies including the China National Tourism Administration and the State General Administration of Sports jointly issued the “Plans for the Development of Automobile Campsites for Self Drive Sports”. In the same month, in the “Action Plan for Advancing Quality Enhancement and Upgrading in Rural Travel Development (2017)“ jointly printed and circulated by 14 government agencies including the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance, self drive travel was mentioned as a priority."
4661,政策的出台，为国内自驾游发展提供了机遇与政策引导。,The introduction of policy measures has provided opportunities and policy guidance for the development of domestic self drive travel.
4662,自驾游俱乐部盈利微薄，完整产业链是关键,Self drive travel clubs make meager profits; complete industry chain is key
4663,虽然国内的自驾游市场潜力巨大，国家政策积极引导，但自驾游行业仍然处在初级阶段。,"Although there is enormous potential in the self drive travel market, and active guidance from national policy measures, the self drive travel industry is still at its infancy stage."
4664,据《2016－2017中国自驾游年度发展报告》显示，国内自驾游俱乐部、汽车俱乐部、车友会等达到数千家，但游客自助安排自驾出游的比例却占据大部分，参加车友会、自驾游俱乐部等各类机构的游客占比只15％左右。,"According to the “2016-2017 Annual Report on the Development of China’s Self Drive Travel Industry”, domestic self drive travel clubs, automobile clubs and automobile enthusiasts clubs number in the thousands, tourists who arrange their own travel itinerary account for a larger proportion. The proportion of tourists who join automobile enthusiasts clubs, self drive travel clubs and other such entities only account for about 15%."
4665,同时，自主研发自驾游产品的在线旅游企业和传统旅行社也是屈指可数，很多在线旅游平台上售卖的只是一些供应商提供的自驾游产品，一些自驾游俱乐部也是重要的供应商。,"Meanwhile, there are only a handful of online tour companies and traditional travel agencies that develop proprietary products for self drive travel. Many online travel platforms only sell self drive travel products provided by some suppliers. Some self drive travel clubs are also key suppliers."
4666,从组织自驾游活动来说，涵盖了“吃、住、行、游、购、娱”多个方面，碎片化程度高，上游供应链重，游客消费随机性大。,"In terms of organizing self drive travel activities, this encompass various aspects including “board, lodging, transport, travel, shopping, entertainment”. Fragmentation is high, and upstream supply chain heavy. There is also significant randomness in tourist spending."
4667,北京行天下汽车俱乐部创始人兼CEO李冠杰认为自驾游俱乐部本质上和旅行社是类似的，早期的主要盈利模式都是以线下活动为主，核心点是自驾游线路产品和领队服务。,"Li Guanjie, founder and CEO of Beijing XTX Auto Club, believes that self drive travel clubs are similar to travel agencies in essence. The primary earnings model at the initial stage are mainly based on offline activities. The core areas are self drive travel route products and guide services."
4668,但是如今自驾游领域内线路产品同质化严重、领队服务水平参差不齐，自驾游俱乐部面临着再次转型的需求。,"However, there is significant product homogeneity in route products within the self drive sector, and the standard of guide services is mixed. Self drive travel clubs are again confronted with the need to restructure."
4669,可以看出，自驾游本身并不是一个独立的产业，而是以其自驾游的位移特点形成了一个跨地域、行业的生态圈，形成完整的产业链十分重要。,"It is quite apparent that self drive travel is not an independent industry in and of itself. Rather, it is an inter-regional and -industry ecosystem based on movement characteristics of self drive travel. The creation of a complete industry chain is key."
4670,专家指出，除了基本的旅游消费外，体验是更重要的消费元素。,"Experts have pointed out that in addition to basic tourist consumption, experience is a more important consumption element."
4671,因此，对于自驾游行业发展，应增强体验特征，发展“自驾游＋”主题以及自驾游产品的IP。,"Hence, with regards to the development of the self drive travel industry, the experience feature should be enhanced. A “self drive travel +” theme as well as self drive travel product IP should be developed."
4672,风景道不仅是道路，汽车营地不应只满足食宿,"Scenic routes are not merely roads, and automobile campsites should not merely meet board and lodging requirements"
4673,面对自驾游兴起，自驾游的基础配套发展同样也还比较初级。,"Confronted with the rise in self drive travel, the development of self drive travel infrastructure is similarly still fairly rudimentary."
4674,李冠杰指出，旅游风景道不只是一条路而已，而是需要将交通跟旅游的元素都融合在里面，但是修公路和做旅游本身是两个部门来负责，交通部门增加旅游元素，也还停留在建设厕所、咨询中心、宣传栏等设施，与旅游的结合度还不高。,"Li Guanjie pointed out that scenic travel routes are not merely a road. Rather, traffic and tourism elements should be integrated into it. However, building roads and tourism are the responsibility of two separate department. The increase in tourism element by transport departments are still stuck at the level of building rest rooms, information centers, publicity bulletin boards and other such facilities. Their degree of bonding with the tourism is low."
4675,对比知名的自驾游路线“美国66公路”，建设经验值得借鉴。,"These could draw lessons from the building experience of the renowned self drive route of “US Route 66”,"
4676,风景道设计不再是出发地到目的地之间最直接快捷的路径，而是遵从“体验驾车乐趣”的设计理念，为自驾游客提供欣赏沿路美景的最佳享受；风景道能够将点状、面状旅游景观相联结，既保留了沿线生态旅游资源的历史价值和文化价值，也能举办各类主题性活动增强游客的参与性与游憩体验，为当地旅游业创造经济效益。,"The design of scenic routes is no longer the most direct and fastest route from the place of origin to the destination but adhering to the design concept of “experience the joy of driving” so as to provide self drive travelers the best enjoyment of beautiful scenery along the route. Scenic routes are able to connect spots and facets of the travel landscape. These would help retain the historical value and cultural value of the eco-tourism resources along the route. Meanwhile, various thematic activities may also be held to enhance tourist participation and recreation experience, creating economic benefit for the local tourism industry."
4677,除了风景道之外，营地也是自驾游的重要配套设施。,"In addition to scenic routes, campsites are also important supporting facilities for self drive travel."
4678,但新京报记者所了解的自驾游游客中，选择在营地住宿的消费者不多。,"However, a Beijing News reporter understands from self drive travelers that few consumers would choose to stay at campsites."
4679,他们认为，很多营地偏向于基础建设，只能满足吃住，档次不高，产品单一，无法满足自驾游这种包含很多元素的需求。,"They believe that many campsites are infrastructure and can only meet board and lodging requirements. Considered low class with dull product features, they are unable to meet the multi-faceted demands of self drive travel."
4680,有不愿透露姓名的业内人士表示，前几年做营地的企业很多是为了拿地，拿地以后，后期的配套的基础设施建设和服务都没有跟上，经营状况很多都是亏损，而没有后期的资金注入，很难做一些相应的配套产品。,"An industry insider who wished to remain anonymous said that a few years ago, enterprises operate campsite mostly for the purpose of acquiring land. After they acquire the land, follow-up development of complementary infrastructure and services have not caught up. These operators are loss-making, and do not have later-stage capital injection. Hence, providing corresponding complementary products proved very difficult."
4681,消费群,Consumer groups
4682,据中国旅游车船协会2017年发布的数据显示，从年龄上来看，自驾游群体集中在21－40岁，其中尤以31－40岁为主，这部分人群拥有一定的经济基础，并且对个性化旅游的需求度较高，且多为亲子游客户。,"Data published by the China Tourism Automobile And Cruise Association in 2017 showed that in terms of age, self drive travelers are concentrated in the 21-40 age group, mostly in the 31-40 cohort. This group has a certain level of income, and are relatively demanding in terms of customized travel. Many are family oriented customers."
4683,从住宿调查看，自驾游人群相对更加偏好非标准住宿。,A survey in lodging revealed that self drive travelers prefer non-standard lodging.
4684,从自驾游类型来看，周边自驾是自驾游的最主要类型，占比84．32％。,"In terms of self drive travel categories, driving in neighboring areas is the predominant category, accounting for 84. 32%."
4685,出境自驾是很多人的向往，但占比还较小。,"Self drive travel overseas is a dream for many, but the proportion is still relatively small."
4686,同时随着消费需求的提升，过去喜欢自驾“游览景点”的游客开始转变观念，不再是自驾游过程中“下车拍照、上车睡觉”，而是更加关注旅行的体验和过程。,"Meanwhile, with higher consumption demand, tourists who enjoyed self drive “tour of sights” have begun to change their opinion. Instead of “alighting to take photos, and boarding to sleep” during the self drive travel process, they are now more concerned with the travel experience and process."
4687,恐龙利用伪装躲避敌人,Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies
4688,乍一看，它挺可怕的，但看起来却像一尊雕像。,"At first glance, it looks like a statue albeit a terrifying one."
4689,研究人员公布了有关加拿大矿工发现的如犀牛般大小的、不可思议的生物化石的首个研究成果，指出这个化石保存完好，因此，专家们将其称为“恐龙界的蒙娜丽莎””。,Now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner were so well preserved experts have described it as 'the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs'.
4690,这尊化石保存得非常完好，甚至能够断定其鳞状皮肤的颜色为红棕色。这说明它有过一些“烦恼的经历”。,"It was so well preserved, they were even able to determine the colour of its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and say it had something of a 'troubled past'."
4691,《当代生物学》杂志中的相关报道将其描述为“有史以来发现的保存最完好的披甲恐龙，也是世界上最好的恐龙标本之一。”,"The report in the journal Current Biology described it as 'the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.'"
4692,该化石是一种新发现的结节龙种类，其生活在 1.1 亿至 1.12 亿年前的白垩纪中期。,"The fossil is a newfound species of nodosaur, which lived midway through the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago."
4693,其保存状态极为完好，震惊了研究人员，他们形容它“真的令人叹为观止”。,"It's incredible well preserved state has stunned researchers, who describe it as 'truly remarkable'"
4694,据《国家地理杂志》报道，该种草食披甲恐龙化石是有史以来发现的保存最完好的同类恐龙化石。,"The armoured plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to reports in National Geographic."
4695,2011 年 3 月 21 日，肖恩?芬克 (Shawn Funk) 在加拿大艾伯塔省北部麦克默里堡附近的森科尔千禧矿场挖矿时发现了这具化石。,"It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011."
4696,当时，他碰到某种似乎与周围岩石不大一样的东西，于是，他决定仔细地看了一下。,"He hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look."
4697,之后，他所发现的化石被送往到加拿大皇家泰瑞尔古生物博物馆。,The fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
4698,研究人员耗时 6 年时间才使藏在2500磅（1100 公斤）的土块内部的这具野兽露出真面目。,"They spent the next six years working on uncovering the beast within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) lump of earth."
4699,经过这么艰辛的工作，最终的结果现在才得以公布。,"After all that hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled."
4700,“如果你觑着眼看，你几乎会相信它正在睡觉”，皇家泰瑞尔博物馆科学家、第一作者迦勒?布朗 (Caleb Brown) 说道。该生物就在该展览馆展出,"'If you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping,' said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display."
4701,“它将成为科学史上最美丽，保存最完好的恐龙标本之一 - 恐龙界中的蒙娜丽莎。”,'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
4702,研究人员通过研究其皮肤，发现这种草食生物虽然身披盔甲，就像步行坦克一样，但有可能会受到来自食肉恐龙的重大威胁。,"By studying its skin, researchers found that this plant-eater, though covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, likely faced a significant threat from meat-eating dinosaurs."
4703,该种身披重甲的恐龙使用红白伪装来躲避捕食者，并采用被称为“反荫蔽”的隐蔽术，这种手段也被许多现代动物所使用。,"The heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and employed a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern-day animals."
4704,专家表示，通过这种方式，它能够更好地与周围环境融为一体，从而避开敌人，这表明它被更大的恐龙所捕食。,"This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs."
4705,这个拥有 1.1 亿年历史的生物属于结节龙家族的一员，在 5 月份首次成为头条新闻，目前正在皇家泰瑞尔古生物博物馆上展出。,"The 110-million-year-old creature, part of the nodosaur family, first hit headlines in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology."
4706,作为团队成员之一的博物馆技术人员马克?米切尔 (Mark Mitchell) 耗时 7000 个小时精心地揭开该巨兽的面纱后，研究人员现在对其进行研究，并将其命名为“Borealopelta markmitchelli”。,"Researchers have now studied and named the beast Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it."
4707,样本保存极为完好，从而使得米切尔博士，以及国际科学家团队可以对其身上的鳞片和铠甲的图案和形状进行记录。,The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body.
4708,他们发现了“反荫蔽”术，这是动物界中一种常见的防御方式，这意味着该种生物的背部比其侧面的颜色更暗。,"They discovered countershading, a common method of defence in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside."
4709,尽管“反荫蔽”术很常见，但发现的结果却令人惊讶，因为该种恐龙的体型远远超过了采用反荫蔽术的现有动物。,"Although countershading is common, the findings come as surprise because Borealopelta's size far exceeds that of countershaded animals alive today."
4710,这种恐龙面临被肉食恐龙猎杀的压力，从而朝有利的方向进化，使其能够在对垒中隐藏起来，以此作为生存的手段。,It suggests the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured concealment over confrontation as a means of survival.
4711,但是，现存的大多数采用反荫蔽术的动物，比如鹿，斑马或者犰狳等，都像猎物一样小和脆弱，这表明该生物面临着真正的生存压力。,"But most contemporary animals that have countershading -- think deer, zebras or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, signaling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle to survive."
4712,“大型重甲恐龙遭受疯狂捕食表明，白垩纪的食肉恐龙是多么危险”，布朗说。,"'Strong predation on a massive, heavily-armored dinosaur illustrates just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been,' said Brown."
4713,针对其鳞片中有机复合物的化学分析同样表明该恐龙的皮肤颜色为红棕色。,Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also reveal that the dinosaur's skin would have been reddish brown.
4714,科学家们正在继续研究该生物的生命线索，包括其所保留的胃含物以找出最后进食的食物。,"Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents to find out what it ate for its last meal."
4715,他们认为，恐龙在死亡时堕入河流中，随后被冲进大海，最后以背朝下的方式沉入海底。,"They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank on its back to the ocean floor."
4716,当时，艾伯塔省的气候和今天佛罗里达州南部的气候一样温暖，河流和海洋可能比现在更加深入内陆。,"At that time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now."
4717,布朗说：“这种结节龙真正令人惊叹，因为它被保存的鳞状皮肤完全覆盖，而且，至今被保存在维空间里，从而使其原始形状得以保存。”,"'This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin, yet is also preserved in three dimensions, retaining the original shape of the animal,' said Brown."
4718,“因此，该种生物现在的形状和白垩纪时的形状几乎一样。,'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous.
4719,你无需用太多的想象力来重建它；如果你觑着眼看，你几乎会相信它正在睡觉。”,"You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping.'"
4720,白垩纪时期是两足行走的大型兽脚类恐龙在地球上漫游的时期。,"The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth."
4721,尽管霸王龙是恐龙中的王者，但是，它在披甲恐龙之后数百万年才出现。披甲恐龙可能已经被霸王龙的一些祖先捕杀了。,"Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its formidable ancestors."
4722,它们包括高棘龙，一种重达 6 吨、长 38 英尺（11.5 米）的巨兽。,"They include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38ft (11.5m) long monster weighing six tonnes."
4723,最新研究发现出现在《当代生物学》杂志上的科学家们相信，结节龙死后被冲到海里，之后在泥土中形成了木乃伊。,"The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was washed out to sea after it died and mummified in mud."
4724,2011 年 3 月 21 日，肖恩?芬克在加拿大阿尔伯塔省麦克默里堡附近的千禧矿场挖掘到该生物。,"The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011."
4725,据博物馆介绍，它是世界上保存最完好的披甲恐龙，从鼻子到臀部的区域中的皮肤和盔甲等都是完整的。,"According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from the snout to hips."
4726,这种生物平均长约 18 英尺（5 米），重达 3000 磅（1300 公斤） 。,"The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."
4727,它有两个 20 英寸长的、从肩部突起的尖角。,It featured two 20-inch-long spikes which protruded from its shoulders.
4728,研究人员认为，这种草食披甲恐龙在现在的加拿大西部地区活动，之后被爆发洪水的河流冲入大海。,"The researchers believe that the this armored plant-eater lumbered through what is now western Canada, until a flooded river swept it into open sea."
4729,但是，这种恐龙葬身海底使其披甲得以完整保存。,But the dinosaur's undersea burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
4730,这种特殊样本的化石遗骸保存非常完好，使残留的皮肤仍然覆盖着恐龙头骨上凹凸不平的甲片。,The fossilised remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that remnants of skin still cover bumpy armour plates along the dinosaur's skull.
4731,正如迈克尔?格瑞斯考 (Michael Greshko) 在《国家地理》杂志上所写的那样，这种保存程度就像中彩一样，是十分罕见的。,"As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of preservation 'is a rare as winning the lottery."
4732,我越看越觉得它令人难以置信。,"The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes."
4733,残留的皮肤化石仍然覆盖在恐龙颅骨上斑驳的盔甲之上。,Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal's skull.
4734,它的右前掌位于其侧面，五个足趾向上展开。,"Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward."
4735,我可以将其甲片统计出来。”,I can count the scales on its sole.'
4736,记者了解到，将天然或植物源的海藻酸类、腐植酸类和氨基酸类增效载体加入到尿素生产工艺中可对传统尿素进行改性增效，形成的海藻酸尿素、锌腐酸尿素、禾谷素尿素氮素利用率较普通尿素提高5～10个百分点。,"Reporters understand that adding alginate, humic acid and amino acid nutrient carriers of natural or plant sources into the production process of urea would change modify and enhance the benefit of traditional urea. The alginate urea, zinc fulvate urea and aminoglutanic acid urea nitrogen utilization rate was 5 to 10 percentage points higher than general urea."
4737,环境友好，作物增产潜力明显，尤其大颗粒增值尿素更是BB肥的优质原料。,"In a positive environment, an increase in crop yield potential will be significant; in particular, large value-added urea pallets are quality raw materials for bulk blending fertilizer."
4738,这一安保人员总数要比2012年伦敦奥运会的安保人数多出一倍。,The total number of security personnel is double that of the 2012 London Olympics.
4739,为确保里约奥运会的安全，巴西将启动有史以来最大规模的安保联动计划。,"In order to ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will start the largest ever security linkage plan."
4740,之前，巴西政府表示，来自军队和警察的总共8.5万人将协同作战，其中包括2万名军人和6.5万名警察。,"Earlier, Brazil government has said that a total of 85,000 troops and polices, including 20,000 troops and 65,000 polices, will fight together for the security of the Olympics."
4741,大部分军人将负责保卫奥运场馆，而新增的3000名军人将负责国际机场、地铁站和街道的安保工作。,"Most troops will be responsible for safeguarding the Olympic venues, while the new 3,000 troops will be responsible for the security of international airports, subway stations and streets."
4742,警察则在城市其他地方巡逻，包括地铁、公交和街道。,"The polices will patrol around other areas of the city, including subways, buses and streets."
4743,据悉，目前已经有6000名军人抵达里约为奥运安保服务。,"It is reported that 6,000 soldiers have arrived in Rio and provided security services for the Olympics."
4744,他们除了负责里约奥运会的四大赛区外，还负责在机场以及连接机场和奥运场馆的主要道路上巡逻。,"In addition to the four competition areas, they will also patrol airports and main roads connecting airports to the Olympic venues."
4745,服务行业引入评价机制早已不是新鲜事，要想使评价机制发挥实效，重要的是让监管更有效，不流于形式。,"Appraisal mechanisms in the services sector are nothing new. The key to having these appraisal mechanisms play an effective role is to have more effective supervision, rather than being a mere formality."
4746,激进主义分子如何学习回答这个问题：“谁的街道？”,How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
4747,2014 年 8 月 9 日，布列塔尼·费雷尔内心惶惑不安。,"On Aug. 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core."
4748,在抵达纽约市旅行的第一天，这位圣路易斯人就坐在爱彼迎租住床上，在手机上浏览脸谱网。,"Just a day after arriving in New York City on a trip, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb she was renting, scrolling through Facebook on her phone."
4749,她偶然发现一位高中生的帖子。,She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.
4750,上面写道“警察刚杀死一个 18 岁的孩子，孩子还躺在街上”。,"""The police just killed an 18 year old kid and he's still laying in the street,"" it read."
4751,她发现馈送信息上没有其他人发布这条信息，她感到很困惑。她关了脸谱网，打开推特。,"Confused, noticing no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."
4752,一位 @TheePharoah 用户不断给她推送动态时报。,A user with the handle @TheePharoah was being constantly retweeted onto her timeline.
4753,圣路易斯地区的说唱歌手现场推特直播迈克尔·布朗的死亡事件。迈克尔·布朗是一名未携带武器的 18 岁黑人，在密苏里州弗格森被一名白人警察打死。,"The St. Louis-area rapper was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo."
4754,他贴了一张布朗失去生命体征的身体躺在街上的图片，他的尸体在街上躺了四个小时。,"He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out in the street, where it would stay for four hours."
4755,“疯了，”费雷尔心想。,"""This is wild,"" Ferrell thought to herself."
4756,但对她和她所在的社区来说，死亡并不是什么新鲜事。,But death was nothing new for her and her community.
4757,她放下手机，直到当天晚上才再次打开推特，读到关于坎菲尔德大道众人聚集的推文。,She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
4758,有警察录像和人们叫喊的照片，还有一个自称是布朗父亲的人的照片，上面写着：“弗格森警察刚刚杀死了我手无寸铁的儿子！”,"There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, ""Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"""
4759,她看到一条现场馈送消息，一名警察用带着一条吠犬站在一群抗议者面前。,She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
4760,她说，在另一个视频中，另一名警察举起他的步枪尖叫道：“我会杀死你们所有人......畜牲。”,"In another video, a different cop, she said, cocked his rifle and screamed, ""I'll kill all you ... animals."""
4761,“这不正常，”费雷尔回忆时说道。,"""'This is not usual,'"" Ferrell recalled saying."
4762,“这不是我们习以为常的、可以称之为典型的谋杀事件。”,"""'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'"
4763,那一刻，我感到不寒而栗。,In that moment I felt chills.
4764,我很生气，气哭了。”,"I was angry and crying."""
4765,她预定了回程航班，第二天就回家了。,She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
4766,下午 11 点着陆后，她从父亲家接走了 6 岁的女儿，决定两人第二天早上前往弗格森。,"After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her dad's house and decided the two of them would head to Ferguson the next morning."
4767,在接下来的三年里，费雷尔和弗格森发生了什么事情，就是 8 月 11 日在影院上映的一部新纪录片“谁的街道？”的主题。,"What happened, to Ferrell and to Ferguson in the following almost three years is the subject of a new documentary, ""Whose Streets?,"" in theaters Aug. 11."
4768,这是一个有关从居住在这个社区、挤满大街小巷要求获得答案的人们的角度，讲述生存和抗议、爱和失落、力量和坚韧的故事。,"It's a tale of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the vantage point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers."
4769,费雷尔和女儿（穿着花裙子、带着冠冕配饰）一起开车去弗格森时，两人重新讨论了她们在那天早上之前讨论过无数次的话题--“关于黑人经历和黑人状况”。,"As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two revisited a conversation they'd had countless times before that morning ""about the black experience and black condition."""
4770,“你还记得我教过你什么时候黑人不得不为自己的信仰而战吗？”她回忆道。,"""You remember how I taught you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in?"" she recalled saying."
4771,“我们现在要去弗格森，因为警方杀死了一名 18 岁的男孩，这是不对的。,"""We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right."
4772,我不得不带上她，”费雷尔后来说。,"I couldn't not take her,"" Ferrell said later."
4773,“今天发生的事情是过去所有事情的......高潮。,"""This happening today is a culmination of ... that has happened in the past."
4774,她要知道、看到并且从这件事中崛起。,She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
4775,她不仅需要在激进主义和组织方面发展良好，而且要了解黑人经历和黑人状况的不同层面，了解我们必须做什么才能获得自由和解放。,"She needs to be well developed in the area of not just activism and organizing but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free, to free ourselves."
4776,即使我有幸为她提供她没有亲身体验过的种族主义经历，她与别的黑人女孩也没有什么不同。,"Even if I'm fortunate enough to provide her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman-child."
4777,如果我在这件事情上保护她，我觉得我是在伤害她。”,"I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."""
4778,他们抵达弗格森的第一站位于南佛罗里桑路警察局对面的一个场地。激进分子等到警官达伦·威尔逊最终不予起诉的结果后，这个场地就成为了他们的营地。,"The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site across from the police department that became a campground of sorts as the activists awaited word of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-indictment."
4779,费雷尔和她女儿与一位做袋装午餐的当地企业老板联系上。,There Ferrell and her daughter linked up with a local business owner who was making sack lunches.
4780,他们准备了袋子，负责将袋子传给抗议者。,They prepared bags and helped pass them out to protesters.
4781,慢慢地，费雷尔开始形成一种新型的行动主义。,"Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell."
4782,她说道，“我的激进主义在 8 月 9 日之后彻底改变了。”在密苏里州立大学圣路易斯分校就读本科时，她是少数民族护士生协会主席，关注黑人社区的粮食正义与健康差距问题。,"""My activism completely transformed after Aug. 9,"" she said, noting that while an undergrad at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities."
4783,“我没有组织经验。,"""I had no experience in organizing."
4784,这一切就这么来了。”,"It all just came."""
4785,几周之后，费雷尔在一场夜间游行中与影片联合导演萨巴赫·福莱扬会面。,"Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration."
4786,福莱扬说她和她的摄影导演卢卡斯·阿尔瓦拉多·法勒“只是想记录”发生了什么。,"Folayan said she and her director of photography Lucas Alvarado-Farrar ""just wanted to document"" what was happening."
4787,费雷尔脑海中浮现一个问题：“你是想记录还是想找到一个你可以加以利用的故事？”,"A question came to Ferrell's mind: ""Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"""
4788,这种怀疑来源于很多这种案例：人们 - 通常是白人 - 进入一个社区，以从其痛苦和坚韧中获得利益。,That skepticism was informed by countless instances of people - often white - coming into a community to profit off its pain and resilience.
4789,正如福莱扬在最近一次采访中所解释的那样，“我们听说在弗格森土生土长的人们没有集中他们的声音，而我们想要以不同的方式去做。”,"As Folayan explained in a recent interview, ""We had heard that people who are born and raised in Ferguson were not having their voices centered, and we wanted to do it differently."""
4790,福莱扬已经与联合导演戴蒙·戴维斯联系上。戴蒙·戴维斯是一位以针对死囚犯的激进主义而闻名的地区艺术家。,"Folayan had already linked up with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism around death row inmates."
4791,他的参与使费雷尔和其他六位当地人一起加入了“谁的街道？”项目团队，在布朗遭枪击之后几年中一直不离不弃。,"His involvement endeared Ferrell to the project, along with six other locals the ""Whose Streets?"" team followed in the years after Brown's shooting."
4792,“这部纪录片不是有人为我们说话或与我们谈话，这是我们的发言。”戴维斯说。,"""This documentary is not somebody speaking for us or speaking to us, it's us speaking,"" Davis said."
4793,“我主要关注这些人物如何呈现，因为这也是我被呈现的方式。”,"""That was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, because that's how I will be represented."""
4794,尽管目标不是关注费雷尔的经历 – 而是展现这次运动“不是关于救世主领导者，而是关于社区凝聚力”，福莱扬说 – 事实证明她是电影参与者中最开放的。,"While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is ""not about a messiah leader but a community coming together,"" Folayan said - she proved to be the most open of the film's participants."
4795,结果，“谁的街道？”令人惊讶地记录了费雷尔的个人生活，比如坠入爱河、步入结婚。,"As a result, ""Whose Streets?"" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and marrying her wife."
4796,“我感觉自己赤裸裸的，”费雷尔第一次看到成品时大笑起来。,"""I felt like I was naked,"" said Ferrell, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product."
4797,“但我明白，做这项工作并将黑人人性化，必须要有一定程度的脆弱性。”,"""But I understood that with doing this work and humanizing black folks, there has to be a level of vulnerability."""
4798,此外，费雷尔的故事重申并重新定位了黑人酷儿女性在更广泛的黑人生活事件运动中的角色。,"Moreover, Ferrell's story reiterates and re-centers the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement."
4799,该运动三位创始人中的两位 -- 在 2012 年黑人青少年特雷沃恩·马丁枪击案之后在社交媒体上创造了#BlackLivesMatter -- 被认定为酷儿。,Two of the movement's three founders - who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Trayvon Martin - identify as queer.
4800,“领导层中的黑人酷儿女性总体上支撑了这一运动，”费雷尔说，“那是因为我们在多个战线上不断战斗。,"""Black queer women in leadership has sustained the movement overall,"" said Ferrell, ""and that's because we're constantly at battle on multiple fronts."
4801,黑人酷儿女性必须承受这一切。”,"Black queer women have to bear the brunt of it all."""
4802,福莱扬同意并提到“这个运动真的得到了黑人女性和许多黑人酷儿女性的支持。”,"Folayan agreed noting that ""the movement is really upheld by black women and a lot of queer black women."""
4803,因为她的身份，费雷尔被选为影片的核心。然而，她坚称“这不是对为事情的肯定行动”。,"She insists, however, that ""this is not some affirmative action type of thing"" where Ferrell was chosen as the film's heart because of her identities."
4804,“她是激发这种能量的人，”她说。,"""She was the person who was galvanizing this energy,"" she said."
4805,“虽然她在前线，但这并不是巧合。因为在这些十字路口的生活中，作为一个黑人酷儿女性，你有很多事情要做。,"""It's not a coincidence though she was on the front lines, because living life at those intersections as a black queer woman, you have so much on the line."
4806,通过荧幕，你可以感受到她的能量。”,"You can feel her energy through the screen."""
4807,与此同时，在弗格森，新闻摄影机早已消失，但社区和警方之间紧张的种族关系依然存在。,"Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the news cameras are long gone but fraught racial ties between the community and police persist."
4808,由于在一次游行期间试图封锁高速公路，费雷尔被判两年半以上缓刑。,Ferrell is on probation for 2½ more years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
4809,她描述她称之为家的地区的社会政治氛围：“一团糟。”,"She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply: ""A mess."""
4810,尽管如此，自从三年前走上弗格森街头时，她一直坚持自己努力铭记的圣歌。,"Still, she clings to a chant she's committed to memory since taking to Ferguson's streets a full three years ago."
4811,“我们有责任为自由而战。,"""It is our duty to fight for our freedom."
4812,我们有责任赢得胜利。,It is our duty to win.
4813,我们必须相亲相爱相互支持。,We must love and support each other.
4814,我们再无可失，除了身上的枷锁。”,"We have nothing to lose but our chains."""
4815,事实上，十年之前网络上就已经提供在线翻译服务了，而其实在很早以前，关于“机器即将替代人类进行翻译”的论调就不绝于耳。,"Online translation services were actually already available on the Internet a decade ago, and in fact, a very long time ago, there was a prevalent view that “machines will replace human translation”."
4816,相似之处：艺术家使用切尔西?曼宁 (Chelsea Manning) 的 DNA 创作肖像,A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
4817,"在纽约弗里德曼美术馆的展馆中央有多个面孔：白色、黑色和棕色的，每个面孔之间都有着几乎难以察觉的相似之处,这些面孔则由从天花板上垂下的线绳系着。","In the center of the room at New York's Fridman Gallery are multiple faces - white, black and brown, each bearing an almost imperceptible resemblance to one another - suspended on wires from the ceiling."
4818,这30幅肖像画是由艺术家希瑟?杜威?哈格堡 (Dewey-Hagborg) 使用切尔西?曼宁寄给她的脸颊棉签和头发碎屑进行创作的。,The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
4819,曼宁从利文沃斯堡监狱寄出头发碎屑，因通过维基解密网站泄露了机密外交电报，该名前情报分析人员被判处在此服刑35年。,"Manning sent the clippings from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after famously leaking classified diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks."
4820,展览于 8 月 2 日开幕，标题是“相似之处”。,"The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is titled A Becoming Resemblance."
4821,这是两年来杜威?哈格堡和曼宁的通信的成果，杜威?哈格堡将其学科与自己在技术、计算机科学和艺术相结合，而曼宁是一个著名的不同政见者，曾入狱，并在狱中完成了变性手术。美国前总统奥巴马在任期结束前三天，赦免了她剩余的刑罚。,"It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office."
4822,通过从曼宁的 DNA 进行算法分析，并且以此创建了“很可能出现的外表”的 30 幅肖像。希瑟杜威·哈博格以此做出了一个尖刻又略有点无情的评论。他的评论既是对于 DNA 的多意性的，也是对于身份这一概念本身的。,"By algorithmically analyzing DNA extracted from Manning and using it to create 30 portraits of what someone with that genomic data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg has created a trenchant, if somewhat cerebral, commentary on not only the malleability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted, and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also identity."
4823,曼宁出生时的名字叫布拉德利·爱德华 (Bradley Edward) ，曾公开承认在青春期就认为自己是一名女性。于 2013 年被定罪，涉及20项指控，其中包括 6 起间谍法违规行为，计算机欺诈和盗窃罪。,"Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman as early as adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six Espionage Act violations, computer fraud and theft."
4824,在狱中，她的形象是被抑制的，只有一张照片，具有颗粒感的黑白自拍照，看起来明显的不安，坐在驾驶座上，戴着铂金色的假发。,"From prison, her image was repressed, so much so that there was just one photo - a granular, black-and-white selfie in which Manning, visibly uneasy, sits in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she became associated."
4825,2015 年，希瑟杜威·哈博格在她 2012 年的项目《陌生人的脸 (Stranger Visions) 》中取得了巨大的成功。,"In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was coming off the massive success of her 2012 project, Stranger Visions."
4826,"那件作品中，她使用从烟蒂和口香糖中等法院物证,从碎屑中提取到的 DNA，创建可能相似长相的 3D 人物肖像。","In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the detritus to conjure an image of what these folks might look like."
4827,那是她正好收到来自 Paper 杂志的一封电子邮件。,That was when she received an email from Paper Magazine.
4828,“他们想要采访在监狱里的切尔西·曼宁，并且需要一张肖像照 ”， 希瑟杜威·哈博格在展览开幕式上对媒体说道。,"""They were conducting an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany that article,"" Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition."
4829,当时切尔西·曼宁不能参观，也不能拍照，所以他们联系切尔西，询问她是否有兴趣制作 DNA 肖像。,"And she couldn't be visited and she couldn't be photographed at that time, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she'd be interested in having a DNA portrait made."
4830,于是，这位艺术家和她那被监禁的缪斯成为了本不可能的笔友，在两年的时间里相互交换了许多封信。,"The artist and her incarcerated muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years."
4831,他们甚至创作了一本漫画书《压抑的头像》，由 Shoili Kanungo 所绘制。该漫画书预想总统将来可以对曼宁准许特权，她能够在狱中看到展览。,"They even created a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that envisioned a future where the president would commute Chelsea's sentence and she'd be able to see the exhibition in person."
4832,而奥巴马就在书出版后的几天要求将她获释。这或许是一场机缘巧合，当时曼宁在堪萨斯军事监狱正好度过了第七个年头。,That Obama would indeed call for Manning's release just days after the book went public was a welcome sort of serendipity after seven brutal years at a military prison in Kansas.
4833,此外，这个展览也有另一层深意。因为当代美国，特朗普政府不断地对政府泄密者和变性军人宣战，同时寻找新的、可以在推特上炒作的方式，来赤裸裸地煽动分裂，而这个展览正是要弥合这样的分裂。,"There's also something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening now, as Donald Trump wages war on government leakers and transgender troops while finding new, tweetable ways to further inflame the stark divisions he's been called on to mend."
4834,当被问及这一切特殊的时机，希瑟杜威·哈博格说，“任何事情的发生都有原因”。,"When asked about the peculiar timing of it all, Dewey-Hagborg said that ""things happen for a reason."""
4835,在画廊墙上写下的艺术家声明中，曼宁的超大号签名在下面 (名字中的“i”用一颗心来画出来) ，呼吁结束“以性别、性取向和文化为基础的党派之争乱像。”,"In an artist statement written on the gallery's wall, Manning's super-sized signature below it (the ""i"" in her last name dotted with a heart), called for an end to the ""automatic factionalism that gender, race, sexuality, and culture have been the basis of."""
4836,"对面墙上是她的线粒体DNA序列,用铅笔扭扭曲曲写着 Cs、Gs 和 As 符号。","On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."
4837,通过包含 200 个字母 (或核苷酸，每个艺术家复杂的科学词典) ，希瑟杜威·哈博格希望通过描绘出这些出奇相似的肖像，表达出至少在生理结构上，人人都是这样的。,"By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, per the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to illustrate how astoundingly similar, at least in biological makeup, we all are."
4838,“我希望人们摆脱这种困境，我们的基因组不会关心我们是谁，公开的基因数据是如何解读的，它是多么的主观 ”，希瑟杜威·哈博格说，他的 2007 年的录像作品《虚假记忆》也在展出。,"""What I'm hoping that people will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are, and how open genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it is,"" said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display."
4839,“DNA 数据可以告诉我们很多不同的故事，所以这是其中的 30 个故事。”,"""DNA data can tell so many different stories, so this is 30 of those stories."""
4840,展览中的最后一幅作品，在一个房间内，来自前面插图中篇小说中的一页。,"The final piece in the exhibition, which is contained in a single room, is one page from the aforementioned graphic novella."
4841,展示了在美国的士兵手持扩音器下浮夸、金刚造型的曼宁。,"It shows Manning, emerging, King Kong-esque, from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with a speakerphone in hand."
4842,“当他们使你的演讲停止下来，他们就赢了 ”，墙上写道。,"""When they chill your speech, then they've won,"" it reads."
4843,“所以，千万别闭嘴。”,"""So never shut up."""
4844,“这些内容直接来自她写给我的一封信 ”，这位来自费城的艺术家说。,"""It came directly from a letter that she wrote to me,"" the artist, who hails from Philadelphia, said."
4845,“我就是再害怕，我依然要说出的。”,"""I get goosebumps still talking about it."""
4846,曼宁还没有亲自看过这个展览，正如漫画中那么预见的那样，但是当她这样做的时候，她将由她自己的 DNA 肖像面具，就像一群抗议者在展馆中心获得欢呼。,"Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in-person yet - as was so presciently imagined in the comic book - but when she does, she'll be greeted in the center of the room by the masks, her own genomic simulacra congregated like hordes of protesters."
4847,这也是有目的的，正如展览中的所有物品一样，都达到了她用铅笔写成的遗传单倍群信息的高度 (5.2 英尺，曼宁的身高) 。,"That was purposeful, too, as is everything in the exhibition, down to the height (5""2, Manning's stature) at which her genetic haplogroups were written in pencil."
4848,“在过去，我把他们挂到墙上，但我希望他们觉得自己像一群人 ”，杜威?哈格堡谈到肖像时说道。,"""In the past, I've had them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crowd,"" Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits."
4849,“但我想让它们感觉像是一群跟随着切尔西的抗议者，正如当时人们抗议要释放她一样。”,"""I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind freeing her as well."""
4850,西北大学教授和牛津大学员工因杀人案被通缉,Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide
4851,警方表示，发现一名男子在芝加哥豪华公寓内遭到致命刺伤，一名西北大学教授和一名牛津大学员工随后被通缉，目前正在全国范围内寻找嫌犯。,"A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment, police said."
4852,库克县法院记录显示，周一，42 岁的温德姆·莱塞姆和 56 岁的安德鲁·沃伦因涉嫌特伦顿· H·詹姆斯·康奈尔·杜兰洛死亡案遭发一级无保释谋杀拘捕令。,"On Monday, first-degree murder warrants without bail were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records show."
4853,根据文件记录，26 岁的康奈尔·杜兰洛因多次刺伤而死亡。,"The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times."
4854,芝加哥警察局发布的社区警报称，尸体于 7 月 27 日被发现。,A community alert released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
4855,警察接到电话后到达 Grand Plaza 公寓，发现受害人身上有多处裂伤。,Officers received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several lacerations on his body.
4856,警方称，康奈尔·杜兰洛当场死亡，侦探正在调查这起他杀案，而警方正在积极寻找两名嫌犯。,"Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said."
4857,莱塞姆自 2007 年起一直担任西北大学微生物学和免疫学副教授。,Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
4858,校园关系处副处长艾伦·K·考贝奇在电子邮件声明中表示，莱塞姆现在已经被离职，并且已被禁止进入西北大学校园。,"Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses."
4859,考贝奇表示，“现在这是一个刑事案件，有关当局正在调查，西北大学正在积极配合调查工作。”,"""This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in that investigation,"" Cubbage said."
4860,沃伦是牛津大学高级财务助理。,Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
4861,牛津大学萨默维尔学院发言人在电子邮件声明中表示：“我们一直与英国警方保持联系，随时准备按需协助美国调查机构。”,"A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that, ""We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in any way they need."""
4862,声明补充说，沃伦的同事都深感震惊，并且希望他能够投案自首。,The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.
4863,芝加哥警察局首席联络官安东尼·古列尔米表示强烈鼓励嫌犯向当局自首。,Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities.
4864,古列尔米表示，“警方对他们的下落已经有了一个大概的想法，我们正在努力定位可能的地点。”,"""Police have an idea of their whereabouts but our efforts to locate that are intensifying,"" Guglielmi said."
4865,古列尔米表示，当地、地区和国家当局正在全力协助搜查嫌疑犯。,"Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects."
4866,古列尔米表示，警方接到 Grand Plaza 公寓经理的电话，他刚刚收到一则秘密提示，说 1008 号公寓有情况发生。,Guglielmi said police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a cryptic tip that said something had occurred in apartment 1008.
4867,警方称当时情况非常可怕。,Police described the scene as very gruesome.
4868,古列尔米表示目前仍不清楚这起事件是否也发生在 7 月 27 日。,Guglielmi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27.
4869,他说，根据安全摄像头，确认莱塞姆和沃伦当时在大楼里。,"Lathem and Warren were confirmed to be at the building by security cameras, he said."
4870,“我们相信莱塞姆教授和受害者有一定关系，”古列尔米说。,"""We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,"" Guglielmi said."
4871,Grand Plaza 的管理团队向居民发布声明称：“警方目前正在研究受害者的案发时间线和案发背景，正在调查各种动机，包括一起可能的国内事件。”,"The management team at Grand Plaza released a statement to residents saying, ""Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."""
4872,俄罗斯副总理穆特科表示，“我们将在不久的将来完成世界反兴奋剂机构路线图”,"""We'll complete WADA roadmap in near future"" - Russian Deputy PM Mutko"
4873,俄罗斯副总理维塔利·穆特科表示，落实世界反兴奋剂机构 (WADA) 针对恢复俄罗斯反兴奋剂机构 (RUSADA) 权利的剩余标准不会花费过长时间。,Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said it will not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
4874,“实施路线图标准已经开展到了一定的阶段，RUSADA 获得了与 UKAD（英国反兴奋剂机构）合作进行计划和测试的权利。,"""A certain stage of fulfilling the road map criteria has been carried out, RUSADA obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)."
4875,WADA 路线图在这方面进行了更新，”穆特科周四表示。,"The WADA roadmap was updated in this regard,"" Mutko stated on Thursday."
4876,副总理穆特科在评论世界反兴奋剂机构路线图《遵守规定》的第二部分时做出上述表述。该部分规定了恢复 RUSADA 权利的标准，并于最近在该组织网站上发布。,"The PM was commenting on the second part of WADA's Roadmap to Code Compliance, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and which recently published on the organization's website."
4877,据穆特科所述，标准中不包含任何可能引起俄罗斯担忧的事情。,"According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia."
4878,他补充说，“一切都得已宣布，一切都会实施。,"""Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented."
4879,并且会在不久的将来将结果提交给国际奥委会 [IOC] 和 WADA。”,"And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future,"" he added."
4880,然而，名单中提到的标准之一是，俄罗斯反兴奋剂机构必须公开接受由加拿大律师理查德·迈凯伦就 WADA 批准的关于俄罗斯国家支持在本国体育运动中使用兴奋剂事件的调查结果。,"One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publically accept the reported outcomes of the WADA-sanctioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport."
4881,谈到此事，穆特科说：“我们正在调查，我们的反兴奋剂系统毫无疑问失败了。,"Referring to the matter, Mutko said: ""We are conducting the investigation, as our anti-doping system admitted a failure."
4882,所有措施都已经实施。,All measures have been implemented.
4883,但这背后并不存在国家计划，我们不会承认不存在的东西。”,"But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something that didn't exist."""
4884,穆特科的话回应了俄罗斯独立公共反兴奋剂委员会负责人维塔利·斯米尔诺夫的话。,"Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission."
4885,斯米尔诺夫在当天早些时候接受媒体 Russian outlet RSport 访问时承认了俄罗斯反兴奋剂机构过去存在的问题，但他补充道：“我们多次在各种场合说过，报告中包含有争议的立场和规定。,"Talking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: ""We have said on numerous occasions, that the report contains controversial positions and regulations."

4888,但今年六月，RUSADA 得到允许，今年可以在国际专家和 UKAD 的监督下计划和协调检测。,"It was, however, permitted to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) this June."

4892,再也不用找代购了！这8000多种产品零关税,Forget purchasing agents! These 8000-plus products enjoy zero tariff
4893,在1月11日商务部召开的例行新闻发布会，商务部新闻发言人高峰表示，截至目前，我国已经生效实施的自贸协定有15个，涉及23个国家和地区，涵盖了8000余种零关税的进口产品。,"At the regular press conference of the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) held on January 11th, spokesperson Gao Feng said that to date, China has 15 Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) in force, involving 23 countries and regions, encompassing more than 8000 imported products at zero tariff."
4894,同时，进口化妆品、冰岛三文鱼、智利红酒、东盟的热带水果......你要的这些产品不用再花大价钱代购了。,"Meanwhile, you no longer have to spend a lot of money to have purchasing agents buy the products you want such as imported cosmetics, salmon from Iceland, red wine from Chile, tropical fruits from ASEAN ...."
4895,目前，我国已与24个国家和地区签署了16个自由贸易协定，已经生效实施的有15个，涵盖了8000余种零关税的进口产品。,"Currently, China has signed 16 FTAs, involving 24 countries and regions, of which 15 have come into effect, encompassing more than 8000 imported products at zero tariff."
4896,以农产品为例，随着自贸协定的实施，消费者一年四季都可以品尝到来自不同产地、质优价廉的农产品。,Take agricultural produce for example. The implementation of the FTAs has meant that consumers can now sample affordable agricultural produce from different places of production throughout the year.
4897,比如，东盟的榴莲、荔枝、火龙果等热带水果，进口关税由15%到30%降为零关税。,"For instance, import tariffs have been cut to zero for the following products: tropical fruits from ASEAN such as durians, lychees, and pitaya from 15-30% previously;"

4904,还有消费类电子产品等有较大幅度的降税。,and consumer electronics and other relevant products have also seen a relatively large reduction in tariffs.
4905,同时，自贸区项下的零关税产品还包括许多国内终端消费品制造所需要的中间产品和原材料，也在一定程度上推动了国产消费品的结构升级。,"Products at zero tariff under the FTAs also include intermediates and raw materials required for the domestic production of end-user consumer goods, which will, to a certain extent, also upgrade the mix of domestically produced consumer goods."
4906,商务部新闻发言人高峰表示，我国总进口额近三分之一的产品可以享受自贸协定优惠关税的待遇，其中大部分是终端消费品，给消费者带来了实实在在的好处。,"MOFCOM spokesperson Gao Feng said that approximately one-third of China’s total imported products enjoy tariff concessions under the FTAs, of which the majority are end-user consumer goods, thus providing tangible benefits to consumers."
4907,进一步降低消费品进口关税,Further reductions in import tariffs of consumer goods
4908,自2017年12月1日起，我国对部分消费品进口关税进行调整，进一步降低消费品进口关税，范围涵盖食品、保健品、药品、日化用品、衣着鞋帽、家用设备、文化娱乐、日杂百货等各类消费品，共涉及187个8位税号。,"On December 1, 2017, China further lowered the import tariffs of some consumer goods. The reductions covered 187 eight-digit HS codes comprising food, health supplements, pharmaceuticals, chemical products for daily use, clothing, footwear and headgear, home appliances, culture and recreation, miscellaneous and sundry goods, as well as other consumer goods."
4909,这批消费品的平均税率将由17.3%直降至7.7%，几乎被“拦腰斩”！,"The average tariff rate of these consumer goods more than halved, plunging from 17.3% to 7.7%!"
4910,2018年1月1日起，我国对其他进出口关税也进行了部分调整。,"With effect from January 1, 2018, partial adjustments were also made to other import and export tariffs."
4911,唇膏、眼影、香水等部分化妆品进口关税由10％降至5％；,"The import tariffs of lipstick, eye shadow, perfume and some other cosmetics fell from 10% to 5%."
4912,降低关税以后，意味着消费者不用代购、更无须大老远跑国外去买喜欢的外国产品了。,This decline in tariff rates means that consumers do not have to have a purchasing agent or travel overseas to buy the foreign products they like.

4914,外报：年终美国商场规定差异大 购物退货需谨慎,Foreign press: Year-end return policies at US malls vary widely; be cautious when returning gifts
4915,中新网12月29日电,"China News Service, December 29"
4916,据美国《世界日报》报道，圣诞节刚过，就迎来退货潮。,US-based “World Journal” reported that there was a wave of gift returns just after Christmas.
4917,据美国广播公司(ABC)报道，去年圣诞节出售的商品，约有超过一半被退换货。,A report by American Broadcasting Company (ABC) revealed that approximately half of the goods sold last Christmas were exchanged or returned.
4918,另外，有读者多次爆料网购被骗，消费者在非正规网站购物时需多留心。,"Elsewhere, readers had repeatedly reported having been cheated while shopping online. Shoppers should be on their guard when shopping at unofficial websites."
4919,一般来说，大型购物公司都有正规、合理的退货程序，但若从一些小商店买礼品或电商购物，必须小心。,"In general, large shopping companies have official and reasonable return procedures, but if you have shopped for gifts at certain small stores or online, you must be careful."
4920,罗兰冈的侯女士当地时间12月1日在一家专门卖印花外套的网上店铺，花60多元(美元，下同)买了一件外套，结果到现在也没有寄到。,"A Madame Hou of Rowland Heights bought a jacket from an online store specializing in print jackets for more than $60 (USD, the same hereinafter) on December 1, local time, but has yet to receive her purchase."
4921,她给客服发了邮件，也不见回复。,She sent an email to customer service but did not receive any reply from the store.
4922,另有网友爆料，去年赴美国旅游，向第三方卖家购买一部手机，寄来后发现里面却是一盒橡皮泥。,"Elsewhere, a netizen revealed that when on tour in the US last year, he bought a mobile phone from a third-party seller, but received a box of plasticine on delivery instead."
4923,知道被骗后，向网站申请退款，还好得到全额退款。,"After he realized he was deceived, he applied for a refund from the website. Fortunately, he was able to receive a full refund."
4924,但也有顾客认为，网站退款服务不是百分之百完美。,"Nonetheless, some customers felt that website refund services are not perfect."
4925,一位北加州华裔居民王先生说，曾经两次购某网站的加急配送服务，一次加急服务四元，但两次都没有按时送到。,"Mr Wang, an ethnic Chinese resident of Northern California, purchased goods at a certain website on urgent delivery services twice at a cost of $4 each but both times, the goods failed to arrive promptly."
4926,之后再申请退款，也没有得到回复。,He applied for a refund subsequently but did not get a reply.
4927,大型商场或购物场都有较好的退货政策。,Large department stores or shopping malls have better return policies.
4928,梅西百货(Macy’s)大部分商品180天以内全额退款。,"Most of Macy’s merchandise may be returned for a full refund within 180 days,"
4929,但商品须保持“原有”样子，且需有购买凭证如收据或银行购买记录。,"but the merchandise has to be in its “original” state, and the customer has to produce proof of purchase such as the receipt or the bank purchase record."
4930,如果没有凭证，顾客也可以获得商场积分，可用于购买其他商品。,"Without proof of purchase, the customer may also receive the store’s credit which may be used to purchase other merchandise."
4931,Target对一般商品通常有90天退货期限，电子品通常15天。,"Target has a 90-day return deadline for general merchandise. For electronic products, the deadline is normally 15 days,"
4932,但2017年11月1日至12月25日期间购买的电子、娱乐类商品的退货期限延至30天。,"but it is extended to 30 days for electronic and entertainment related products purchased between November 1 and December 25, 2017;"
4933,需要注意的是，30天退款期限是从12月25日开始算，也就是要在2018年1月25日之前退货。,"note that the 30-day return deadline begins on December 25, i.e., merchandise purchased must be returned by January 25, 2018."
4934,极致购物体验，商圈购物发展新时代来临,The ultimate shopping experience with the advent of a new era in commercial district shopping development
4935,十多年前，我国总体上还处于卖方市场，人们的选择有限，需求也有限。,"More than 10 years ago, China was, on the whole, still a sellers’ market. Selection was limited, and so was demand."
4936,但经过十年的发展，市场早已实现了从卖方市场向买方市场的转变，如今的消费者口味变得更刁，他们不再满足于简简单单的“一手交钱一手交货”的购物行为。,"A decade hence, the market has long developed into a buyers’ rather than that of a sellers’ market. Shoppers have now become a lot more demanding as well, and are no longer satisfied simply with a “cash on delivery of goods” shopping behavior."
4937,因此，如何让消费者得到一场极致购物体验则成了房地产开发商们的下一个竞争点。,"Therefore, how to offer shoppers the ultimate shopping experience has become the next competitive point for real estate developers."
4938,而在影响消费者购物体验的诸多因素中，商圈里的购物中心的影响最为重大。,"Of the many factors that affect a shopper’s shopping experience, the impact of shopping centers in business districts is the most important."
4939,看各地城市建设者如何注重购物体验。,Let’s take a look at how urban builders focus on the shopping experience.
4940,世界上没有两片完全一样的叶子，更没有两个完全一样的购物中心，一个有名的购物中心必然有属于自己的特色。,"No two leaves are alike, nor can one find two completely identical shopping malls. A famous shopping mall must have its own characteristics."
4941,比如土耳其举世闻名的Kanyon购物中心，它独特的波浪形的建筑设计灵感来自大峡谷（Canyon），因此取名为谐音的Kanyon，行走在Kanyon中部长200米的步道中仿佛置身于大峡谷内。,"Take Turkey’s world-renowned Kanyon Shopping Center. Its unique undulating architectural design was inspired by the Grand Canyon, hence its homophonous name Kanyon. You feel like you’re in the Grand Canyon when walking along the 200-meter footpath in the midsection of Kanyon."
4942,除了峡谷式的设计，在购物中心的中央还设有一个向内凹的大型椭圆形演出场地，外形独特，经常会举办特色表演。,"In addition to the canyon-like design, there is a large unique inward concave oval-shaped performance venue in the middle of shopping center where specialty performances are often held."
4943,因为开放的平台设计，使游客行走在每一层都能俯看“峡谷”中进行的活动，并有移步换景的效果。,"Its open platform design offers visitors at every floor a view of the activities held in the “canyon”, and the scene changes as you take each step."
4944,而在国内，有中国首座森林式漫步消费场之称的南京森林摩尔商业街则将购物与生态、童话完美结合在一起。,"In China, the Nanjing Forest Mall Commercial Street, known as the country’s first forest style pedestrian consumption venue, is a perfect integration of shopping and ecology as well as fairy tales."
4945,7000平米绿地广场，3000平米屋顶水域平台，项目由9栋单体建筑组成，各建筑之间空中连廊相接，整体下沉庭院设计，取地缘之上法国梧桐树为建筑表皮，屋顶水域天台，营造出森林般的感觉。,"With a 7,000 sqm green plaza, and a 3,000 sqm rooftop water feature, the project is made up of nine individual buildings, linked by a sky bridge. The sunken garden design for the entire project, plane trees as its architectural surface, and the rooftop water feature create the feeling of being in a forest."
4946,走进森林摩尔，就像一不小心掉进了爱丽丝漫游奇遇记中的兔子洞，攀沿着的树干将建筑围绕，草地、清泉相映衬，将人们带进充满生机与活力的森林。,"On entering the Forest Mall, you’d feel like you have accidentally fallen down the rabbit hole in Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland. The tall tree trunks surround the buildings, and the lawn and stream are beautifully juxtaposed, drawing the masses into a forest full of life and vitality."
4947,还有在重庆，龙湖打造的礼嘉滨水商圈，规划百方商业，计划未来引进超过50家国际顶级专卖旗舰店，100个以上国际顶级品牌和500个以上国内外著名品牌，打造成为服务产业集聚、主题特色鲜明的商业中心。,"Then there is Chonqing. The Lijia Waterfront Business District built by Longhu Properties has plans to attract a diverse range of businesses, and expects to bring in more than 50 world class flagship stores, with more than 100 world class brands and over 500 renowned foreign and domestic brands so as to create a commercial center with a distinctive theme that brings the services sector together."
4948,不仅如此，礼嘉滨水商圈还将生态融入建筑、以TOD公共交通为导向，集时尚购物、生活服务、餐饮、娱乐、教育、运动于一体，在带给消费者极致购物体验的同时还引领他们享受重庆独特的“滨水文化”，将购物与水上娱乐、休闲完美融为一体。,"In addition, the Lijia Waterfront Business District will also integrate ecology into architecture. Based on a transit-oriented development (TOD) concept, it integrates shopping, household services and amenities, dining, entertainment, education and sports, providing shoppers the ultimate shopping experience while affording them the luxury of enjoying Chongqing’s unique “waterfront culture”, a perfect blend of shopping, and water entertainment and recreation."
4949,综上可以发现，目前，已有一部分房企洞悉了这种新的城市商业的发现轨迹，而业内人士表示，这种以消费者体验为中心，如何把购物与体验相结合的消费模式也将是未来城市发展的主流。,"From the above examples, it is noted that, at present, a number of real estate developers have noticed the discovery of this new urban business phenomenon. Insiders indicate that this consumption model which is centered on the consumer experience and which explores the means to combine shopping and experience will become the mainstream of urban development in the future."
4950,现在的商圈不仅仅是货品的集散地，更多的是融合艺术文化、创意主题的综合场所，也承载着人们对都市居住的责任。,"Today’s business districts are no longer merely the distribution centers of goods. Rather, they are more integrated venues that bring together the arts and culture as well as creative themes; they also carry the responsibility of the masses toward urban living."
4951,因此在满足消费者吃喝玩乐购一站式物质需求的同时，最大化的传递文化艺术多层次的精神需求，发挥宜居的居住需求，必然是商圈未来发展的制高点。,"Therefore, in addition to meeting the one-stop material needs of dining and entertainment of consumers, maximizing the transmission of multi-tiered cultural and artistic spiritual needs, as well as bringing the livable qualities of residential needs into play will inevitably become the high point of future business district development."
4952,在重庆，国兴的北岸江山，地处江北，临近观音桥，荟萃世界商业精华，国际巨擘左右环拥，一等品牌齐聚，与国际时尚近距离接驳。,"In Chongqing, Guoxing Property’s Beianjiangshan is located north of the Yangtze River, close to Guanyin Bridge, where the who’s who of world business and international giants agglomerate, and first class brands congregate, affording a seamless connection with international fashion."
4953,这里步步繁华，荟萃世界精华；,"Here, prosperity abounds, and the best in the world agglomerate."
4954,东原锦悦则拥有较好的购物环境，东原锦悦临近南坪商圈，独享西部甚至全国领先的四层立体交通系统，提升了购物舒适度。,"Dongyuanjinyue, which is in the immediate vicinity of Nanping Business District, has a better shopping environment. At its sole disposal is Western China’s, and indeed, the nation’s leading four-story three-dimensional transportation system, enhancing shopping comfort."
4955,另外惠工路和万达广场两条步行街的园林绿化、景观地铺进行了提档升级，种植乔木约300株，改造地铺4万平方米，提升了南坪商圈形象；,"Elsewhere, the landscaped gardens and shops along the two pedestrian streets at Huigong Road and Wanda Plaza have been upgraded, with approximately 300 trees planted, and 40,000 sqm of floor space revamped, lifting the image of Nanping Business District."
4956,而龙湖昱湖壹号，临近重庆首个低密度滨水商圈——礼嘉滨水商圈，被九个公园环绕，商业街区密度低，开放程度高，使得人们购物时更愿意停留、驻足、慢慢享受购物的乐趣，而不是被后面的人流裹挟着急急忙忙地向前赶，真正实现了“散步式购物”。,"Meanwhile, Longhu’s Waterfront City, in the immediate vicinity of Chongqing’s first low-density waterfront business district - Lijia Waterfront Business District - is surrounded by nine parks. The commercial street district is low density with good access. These qualities have made shoppers more willing to stay, stop and slowing savor the joy of shopping when shopping, rather than being jostled by crowds of shoppers into rushing forward. Here, “shopping at a leisurely pace” is truly achieved."
4957,当今商业竞争只会越来越激烈，如何在同质化严重的市场中杀出一条血路，夺得未来消费者心中的“购物圣地”的美誉，值得所有的房地产开发商去认真思考。,"Competition will only intensify going forward. In a market of rampant homogenization, how to achieve success, and attain a reputation as a “shopping mecca” in the hearts of future shoppers deserve serious consideration among all real estate developers."
4958,单单只凭差异化战略是远远不够的，只有那些真真正正地将消费者放在心中，急消费者所急，想消费者所想，给消费者提供极致而又简约的购物体验的开发商才能在暴风雨来临的市场中笑傲江湖。,"A differentiation strategy alone is far from sufficient. Only developers that truly place shoppers in their hearts, empathize with shoppers, and offer shoppers an ultimate yet simple shopping experience will be able to stand tall in a market when assailed by intense competition."
4959,当然，到最后我想最高兴的还是重庆的子民，拥有这么好的购物体验和商圈，放在10年前没人能够想象今日的繁华。,"To be sure, I believe that, at the end of the day, Chongqing’s residents are the happiest lot to have such excellent shopping experience and business districts. A decade ago, no one would have imagined today’s prosperity."
4960,物节：消费主义狂欢掩盖真实环境价格,Shopping carnival: Consumerism revelry masks true environmental cost
4961,1682亿元，这是2017年11月11日，“天猫双十一全球狂欢节”的24小时内，天猫用户消费的成交额。,"RMB168.2 billion. That was the amount of money Tmall users spent over a 24-hour period on November 11, 2017 at the “Tmall 11.11 Global Shopping Festival”."
4962,具体来说，“双11”开局后，短短3分钟天猫成交额就突破100亿，6分05秒超过200亿元，9个小时破1000亿。,"Specifically, in the span of three minutes right after the “Double 11” commenced, Tmall’s transaction volume surpassed RMB10 billion, and exceeded RMB20 billion in six minutes and five seconds; within nine hours, it broke through the RMB100 billion mark."
4963,这一天，全球消费者通过支付宝完成的支付总笔数达到14.8亿笔，比去年增长41％。,"That day, shoppers all over the world made a total of 1.48 billion payments by way of Alipay, an increase of 41% year-on-year."
4964,这些消费将带来8.12亿个物流订单。,Such spending resulted in 812 million logistics orders.
4965,而不论是天猫网购平台还是支付宝支付平台，全都属于马云的阿里集团。,"Whether the Tmall shopping platform or the Alipay payment platform, however, both belonged to Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group."
4966,十年前没人会想到，11月11日单身青年出于自嘲创造的“光棍节”亚文化会被电商收编，成为如今现象级的“双11”购物狂欢节。,"Ten years ago, no one would have imagined that the “Singles’ Day” subculture which was a self-deprecating celebration created by singles on November 11 would be co-opted by e-commerce merchants, and turned into a phenomenal “Singles’ Day” shopping carnival today."
4967,2009年11月11日，阿里巴巴第一次使用“光棍节大促销”的营销噱头：没人跟你谈恋爱，那么“单身狗”们快来网购吧。,"Alibaba used the “Great Singles’ Day Sale” marketing gimmick: Not dating? Singles, come shop online - for the first time on November 11, 2009."
4968,结果令人意外，这一天淘宝商城（“天猫”前身）交易额突破5200万元，是当时日常交易额的10倍。,"The outcome was a surprise. That day, transactions at Taobao Mall (the predecessor of “Tmall”) surpassed RMB52 million, 10 times that of the normal daily transaction value at the time."
4969,从此，“双11”就成为了阿里巴巴打造的购物狂欢节，从一开始的国内买家卖家自娱自乐，到现在全球商家的涌入，九年过去了，天猫“双11”千亿交易额已经是当年的3200多倍，令“黑色星期五”望尘莫及。,"From then on, “Double 11” has become a shopping festival created by Alibaba, and has grown and expanded from a domestic buyer-seller amusement to an inflow of global merchants. Nine years hence, and the more than RMB100 billion worth of transactions of Tmall’s “Double 11” is now more than 3200 times that of the first year, far outstripping that of “Black Friday”."
4970,跟风天猫“双十一”促销的，还有众多电商，其中“京东”最为强劲。,"Numerous e-commerce merchants have followed Tmall’s “Double 11” sales promotion, with “JD.com” the strongest competitor."
4971,"“京东”有自己的购物节“6.18”，但没有“双11”影响大, 今年从11月1日持续到11日，“京东”累计销售额达到1271亿元。","“JD.com” has its own shopping festival “6.18” but its impact is less than that of “Double 11”. From November 1 to 11 this year, “JD.com”’s accumulated sales amounted to RMB127.1 billion."
4972,而“双11”后，紧接着的是与之类似的“双12”打折狂欢、圣诞新年购物档期。,The “Double 12” discount extravaganza and the Christmas-New Year shopping period come right after “Double 11”.
4973,跨过了新年，等待着中国消费者的还有春节前的年货采购档期、情人节购物档期，消费，不会放假。,"Following the New Year, pre-Spring Festival’s Lunar New Year shopping as well as Valentine's Day shopping await the Chinese consumer. Retail consumption knows no holiday."
4974,瞬时间的海量消费带来的环境问题，已经引起专业人士和机构的关注。,"Massive instantaneous consumption has led to environmental problems, which has attracted the attention of professionals and institutions."
4975,据新华每日电讯报道，按业内每个包装箱0.2公斤的通常标准保守估算，今年“双11”期间至少产生超过30万吨垃圾。,"A Xinhua Daily Telegraph report revealed that based on the industry’s general standard conservative estimate of 0.2 kg per packaging cartons, at least 300,000 tonnes of trash were generated during this year’s “Singles’ Day” period."
4976,绿色和平东亚分部污染防治项目主任刘华则告诉中外对话，今年“双11”仅天猫的订单量会产生16万吨包装垃圾。,"Liu Hua, Director of the Pollution Prevention Program at Greenpeace East Asia told chinadialogue that the volume of orders at this year’s “Singles’ Day” from Tmall alone would generate 160,000 tonnes of packaging trash."
4977,国家邮政局2016年曾发布报告，指出2015年“双11”期间（11月11日至16日）的快件量约7．8亿件，使用超过30亿条编织袋，99.22亿个包装箱，169.85亿米胶带，胶带长度可以绕地球赤道425圈。,"In 2016, the State Post Bureau published a report stating that approximately 780 million items were delivered by express couriers during the 2015 “Singles’ Day” period (November 11-16), with more than 3 billion woven bags, 9.922 billion packaging cartons, and 16.985 billion meters of adhesive tape used. The length of adhesive tape used could go round the equator 425 times."
4978,而今年，国家邮政局预计“双11”的快件业务量预计超过15亿件。,"This year, the State Post Bureau estimates that the “Singles’ Day” express business volume could surpass 1.5 billion items."
4979,北京市一座垃圾焚烧中心经理王士告诉新华社， “双11”后每日进场的垃圾都超过2000吨，也超过了焚烧站的处理产能。,"Wang Shi, manager of a waste incineration plant in Beijing told Xinhua News Agency that more than 2,000 tonnes of trash enter the plant each day after “Singles’ Day”, exceeding the treatment capacity of the incineration plant."
4980,快递公司已经意识到了快递业造成的环境污染不可小视。,Express delivery companies have also become aware that the environmental pollution resulting from the express delivery sector should not be ignored.
4981,包括苏宁在内的一些电商物流企业“双11”前推出了可回收重复使用的塑料快递盒、可以重复用作购物袋和垃圾袋的循环包装袋等，但嫌麻烦的消费者接受度并不高。,"Some e-commerce logistics enterprises, including Suning, have introduced plastic express delivery boxes that may be recycled and reused ahead of “Singles’ Day”, as well as recyclable packaging such as shopping bags and trash bags that may be used repeatedly. However, acceptance among consumers who could not be bothered was low."
4982,马云还在微博中号召物流行业支持“绿色包装”和“绿色物流”。,"Jack Ma, on Weibo, has also called on the logistics industry to support “green packaging” and “green logistics”."
4983,这条微博收获了68000多个“赞”。,"This Weibo received more than 68,000 “likes”."
4984,德国人想要什么样的移动支付？,What sort of mobile payment do Germans want?
4985,张冬方：在德国拉开的移动支付战局不具期待性。,Zhang Dongfang: The mobile payment war waged in Germany is nothing new.
4986,微信支付和支付宝不过把战场搬到了欧洲，竞争对手没变，抢夺阵地也没变——中国人，这也算全球化？,All WeChat Pay and Alipay did was to move the battleground to Europe. Neither the competitors nor the battleground has changed - the Chinese; is this really globalization?
4987,有支付宝的地方，必有微信支付。,"Where there’s Alipay, there’s WeChat Pay."
4988,按照和德国电子支付服务商Wirecard的协议，微信支付今年11月正式着手落地德国，并逐渐在欧洲范围内的商家进行布局。,"According to the agreement with Germany’s electronic payment services provider Wirecard, WeChat Pay officially entered Germany in November this year. The Chinese company has also gradually expanded its presence among merchants in Europe."
4989,俩“老乡”的这次异国重逢发生在欧洲。,"This time round, the reunion of the two “fellow countrymen” in a foreign country took place in Europe."
4990,一直以来，支付宝和微信支付在全球化的道路上一路高歌。,"All along, Alipay and WeChat Pay have been riding high on the road to globalization."
4991,对于中国的移动支付的全球化方式，艾瑞咨询《中国第三方移动支付行业研究报告2017》总结为两种：一是通过战略投资，经验输出，入股并扶持国外本土移动支付企业。,"In a study on China’s mobile Internet payment’s globalization methods, iResearch Consulting’s “2017 China's Third-Party Mobile Payment Report” arrived at two methods: The first method would be by way of strategic investment, outward transfer of experience, taking an equity stake, and supporting the overseas local mobile payment enterprise;"
4992,二是通过中国游客出国消费行为，向国外商家推广移动支付服务，进而改变外国本土对中国移动支付的认知和接受度。,"the second method would be by way of promoting mobile payment services to overseas merchants through Chinese tourists’ overseas spending behavior, thereby changing overseas local entities’ recognition and acceptance of China’s mobile payments."
4993,确实，得中国人得天下。,"Indeed, win over the Chinese, and you win the world."
4994,中国经济发展迅猛，再加上人口基数大，中国游客在欧洲的花销是一个诱人的数字。,"China’s rapid economic growth coupled with its large population base have meant that spending by Chinese tourists in Europe is an attractive figure,"
4995,但这也注定了，这次在德国拉开的中国移动支付战局不具期待性。,but this also means that the mobile payment war waged in Germany is nothing new.
4996,微信支付和支付宝不过是把战场搬到了欧洲，竞争对手没变，抢夺的阵地还是没变——还是中国人，这也算全球化？,All WeChat Pay and Alipay did was to move the battleground to Europe. Neither the competitors nor the battleground has changed - it’s still the Chinese; is this really globalization?
4997,更具开拓性的探讨是，中国的移动支付能否在欧洲本土开疆拓土？,A more groundbreaking inquiry would be whether China’s mobile payment can expand its territory in Europe.
4998,以德国为例。,Germany is an example.
4999,被施了魔法的“新零售”,Magical “new retail”
5000,陈歆磊、杨凯涵：亚马逊在挤进全球十大零售商时候宣布进军书店和杂货铺，不论时机还是动机都很值得玩味。,"Chen Xinlei, Yang Kaihan: When Amazon made it to the world’s top 10 list of retailers, it announced that it would venture into the bookstores and grocery stores; this is worth pondering, both in terms of opportunity and motive."
5001,2015年11月，亚马逊在西雅图开设了第一家实体书店，之后又开设了波特兰和圣地亚哥的两家书店。,"In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle. This was followed by two bookstores in Portland and San Diego."
5002,2017年伊始，亚马逊在纽约开设店面，并计划到年底至少拥有8家店面。,"At the beginning of 2017, Amazon opened its bookstore and New York, and planned to have at least eight stores by the end of the year."
5003,几乎同一时间，亚马逊宣布旗下无人超市（Amazon Go）试运营，顾客到店不需要排队，也不需要结账，进门扫码、拿了想要的商品离开即可，购物金额会自动从顾客的亚马逊账户中扣除。,"Almost at the same time, Amazon announced that its checkout-free grocery store Amazon Go would begin trial operations. No waiting in line or checkout is necessary. All customers have to do is scan their QR code on the Amazon Go app to enter the store, take the products they want and leave. The shopping amount would be charged to the customers’ Amazon account."
5004,就亚马逊而言，近几年忽然在实体店上面动作频频是非常意外的一件事。,"As far as Amazon is concerned, its sudden but frequent forays into physical stores in the last few years have been very unexpected."
5005,因为早在2007年的《致股东公开信》中，CEO杰夫•贝佐斯就强调，亚马逊不会轻易开设实体店，除非同时满足下列四个条件：,"This is because way back in 2007, CEO Jeff Bezos, in his “Letter to Shareholders”, highlighted that Amazon would not arbitrarily start a new business (such as a physical store) unless the four conditions set out below are met simultaneously:"
5006,1.我们必须确信这个新机会能让股东的投资有所回报；,1. We must convince ourselves that the new opportunity can generate the returns on capital our investors expected when they invested in Amazon;
5007,2.我们必须确信这个新机会对于整个公司有重大意义；,2. we must convince ourselves that the new business can grow to a scale where it can be significant in the context of our overall company;
5008,3.我们必须确信这个新机会是被市场忽视的；,3. we must believe that the opportunity is currently underserved; and
5009,4.我们必须确信在这个市场上，我们拥有足够的资源能做出面向顾客的差异化。,4. we have the capabilities needed to bring strong customer-facing differentiation to the marketplace.
5010,书店和杂货铺，是两个实体零售中最摇摇欲坠的分类，也是亚马逊兴起后最先倒下的对手。,"Bookstores and grocery stores are the two most precarious physical retail sub-sectors, and were the first to be knocked out after the rise of Amazon."
5011,亚马逊在挤进全球十大零售商的时候宣布进军这两个实体市场，不论时机还是动机都很值得玩味。,"When Amazon made it to the world’s top 10 list of retailers, it announced that it would venture into these two physical markets; this is worth pondering, both in terms of opportunity and motive."
5012,亚马逊的做法，和股东信中的保证相违背吗？,Did Amazon do something in contrary to the guarantee it made in its letter to shareholders?
5013,地球的另一端也听到了类似的声音。2016年10月13日上午，在2016杭州•云栖大会上，阿里巴巴董事局主席马云发表主题演讲。,"Similar words were echoed at the other end of the world. On the morning of October 13, 2016, at The Computing Conference 2016 held in Yunqi, Hangzhou, Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma said in his keynote address that,"
5014,他说：“从明年开始，阿里巴巴将不再提‘电子商务’这个说法。,"“From next year onward, Alibaba will no longer talk about ‘e-commerce’."
5015,纯电商的时代很快就会结束，未来的十年、二十年将没有电子商务，取而代之的是‘新零售’。,"The era of pure e-commerce firms will soon come to an end. E-commerce will no longer exist in the next 10 to 20 years, replaced instead by ‘new retail’."
5016,线上线下和物流结合在一起，才会产生新零售。”,Only by combining online and offline operations will new retail come into being.”
5017,一时间，“新零售”三个字如同被施了魔法，被业界人士频频挂在嘴边。,"In an instant, it was as if the words “new retail” took on magical properties, and became the new catchphrase of industry insiders."
5018,但是，“新零售”究竟是什么意思？,So what is “new retail” exactly?
5019,如果只是指线上与线下相结合，那么这个概念并不新奇。,"If it merely referred to online-offline integration, then the concept is nothing new."
5020,2016年，eMarketer跟踪了180家最大的电商之后估计，电商总销售额约为2000亿美元，而其中最大的25家占到了1590多亿美元。,"In 2016, eMarketer, after tracking 180 of the largest e-commerce firms, estimated that total sales of e-commerce firms amounted to approximately US$200 billion, of which the largest 25 accounted for more than US$159 billion;"
5021,"在这25家之中，有18家都是在过去五年才开始经营线上的传统零售商（比如梅西百货, Nordstrom, Target, Gap等）。","and of these 25, 18 were traditional retailers that had only begun online operations in the preceding five years (such as Macy’s, Nordstrom, Target and Gap)."
5022,而阿里巴巴集团283亿元入股苏宁云商，也还历历在目。,"Indeed, Alibaba Group's RMB28.3 billion acquisition of an equity stake in Suning Commerce Group was still fresh in the minds of the public."
5023,从全球范围看，零售商和电商都在从单一渠道转向覆盖实体店、电商、移动端和社会化媒体的全渠道零售体系。,"From a global perspective, both retailers and e-commerce firms are transforming from a single channel to a multi-channel retail system that encompasses physical stores, e-commerce, mobile terminals and social media."
5024,难道马云提“新零售”，更多的是一种总结而非对未来的展望？,Could Jack Ma’s “new retail” be more of a conclusion rather than a forecast for the future?
5025,如果不是，那么全渠道的概念，与“新零售”究竟有何区别？,"If not, then what is the difference between the multi-channel concept and “new retail”?"
5026,或许，问题的关键不是线上与线下会不会融合，而是怎么融合。,"Perhaps, the crux of the matter is not whether online and offline entities would integrate, but how."
5027,回顾零售业过去的20年，电商的崛起如同早年折扣零售商的兴起，都侧重于价格和便利。,A review of the retail sector in the last 20 years has revealed that the rise of e-commerce was similar to the emergence of discount retailers many years ago; both were focused on price and convenience.
5028,依靠这两个痛点，电商把标准化程度非常高的产品，例如图书和CD，从线下移到了线上。,"On the basis of these two trigger points, e-commerce firms moved highly standardized products, such as books and CDs, online from offline."
5029,随着线上消费习惯的养成以及客户体验的不断提高，电商又将触角伸到了其他品类，并开始提升效率。,"As online retail habits formed, and customer experience continued to rise, e-commerce firms further extended their scope to other product categories, and began to increase efficiency."
5030,用阿里巴巴CEO张勇的话说，“利用互联网的思想和技术去全面改革和升级现有的约30万亿社会零售商总量，使得中国消费者日益升级的消费需求可以得到有效的满足，使得整个商品生产、流通、服务的过程因为互联网、大数据的广泛运用变得更加高效。”,"In Aliababa CEO Daniel Zhang’s words, “Use the thinking behind and technology of the Internet to thoroughly reform and upgrade the approximately 30 trillion retailers in society at this time, so that the increasingly demanding retail requirements of Chinese consumers may be effectively met. This will make the entire goods production, circulation and services process more efficient with the extensive application of the Internet and big data.”"
5031,因此电商的道路，是一条表面轻资产，实际重资产的道路。,"Thus, the path of e-commerce firms is asset-light on the surface, but asset-heavy in reality."
5032,“轻”，指的是固定资产、人员配置、管理流程等负担没有传统零售业大；“重”，指的是在物流、仓储等方面需要巨大的投入。,"“Light” refers to fixed assets, headcount, management processes and other burdens that are less than that of traditional retailers; “heavy” refers to areas such as logistics and storage that require enormous investment."
5033,物流方式的改变，保证了电商的高效率。,Changes in logistical methods ensured the efficiency of e-commerce firms.
5034,据中国政府网消息，国务院总理李克强4月28日主持召开国务院常务会议，会议认为，扩大国内消费需求是稳增长、调结构的重要举措。,"The Chinese Central Government’s official web portal reported that Premier Li Keqiang presided over the State Council executive meeting held on April 28, which was of the opinion that expanding domestic consumption was a key measure for stable growth and structural transformation."
5035,会议确定，有关部门要在科学评估基础上抓紧拿出具体方案。,The meeting determined that relevant departments should promptly put forward specific plans on the basis of scientific evaluation.
5036,对国内消费者需求大的部分国外日用消费品，于今年6月底前开展降低进口关税试点，逐步扩大降税商品范围；,"The import tariffs of some foreign goods for daily use for which domestic consumers have enormous demand will be lowered on a trial basis with effect from June this year, and tariff reductions will be extended to more goods over time."
5037,结合税制改革，完善服饰、化妆品等大众消费品的消费税政策，统筹调整征税范围、税率和征收环节；,"Together with the tax reform, consumption tax policies for general consumer goods such as clothing and cosmetics will be optimized, with overall adjustments made to the scope of taxation, tax rates, and the different parts of the taxation process."
5038,增设和恢复口岸进境免税店，合理扩大免税品种，增加一定数量的免税购物额，方便国内消费者在境内购买国外产品；,"More port of entry duty-free shops will be set up and restored, and the variety of duty-free goods will be expanded appropriately, with the value of duty-free shopping increased by a certain amount so that domestic consumers would find it convenient to purchase foreign products in China."
5039,进一步推进境外旅客购物通关和退税便利化，严格落实进境物品依法主动申报纳税要求。,"Shopping and customs clearance, as well as tax refund for foreign tourists would expedited, and the requirement for voluntary tax declaration of imported goods shall be strictly implemented according to the law."
5040,制定支持跨境电商进口的检验检疫政策，清理进口环节不合理收费；,"Policies that support the inspection and quarantine of cross-border e-commerce imports shall be formulated, and unreasonable fees pertaining to imports shall be put in order."
5041,加快推进中国产品品牌提升工程，支持实体店发展，实现线上线下互动。,"The program to promote the brands of Chinese products shall be accelerated, the development of physical stores supported, and online-offline interaction achieved."
5042,规范市场秩序，严打假冒伪劣，促进优胜劣汰。,"Market order shall be normalized, and strong measures shall be taken to crack down on counterfeit and shoddy products so that the survival of the fittest will be advanced."
5043,让消费者能就近舒心、便捷购物。,"Consumers will be able to shop without having to go far, with comfort and ease of mind, and convenience."
5044,BlackBerry（黑莓）手机一直以来都不以硬件取胜，然而面对同行排挤总得有款像样的，于是就有了这个去年9月发布的Passport。,"BlackBerry mobile phones have never been known to wow the crowd with their hardware, but pressure from competition has meant that it has to offer a presentable model. Hence, the Passport was launched last September."
5045,SONY（索尼）时常会有各种黑科技产品推出，比如在年初发布的这款旗舰级的4K反射型超短焦头一机就是其中之一。,"SONY would often launch various black technology products. For instance, this flagship-class 4K ultra short throw projector it launched at the beginning of the year was one such example."
5046,当然如此高端大气上档次的产品售价自然也是不菲，500万日元大概相当于25万人民币，买辆车都够了。,"Naturally, such a high-end, classy, top-grade product comes with a hefty price tag as well. At JPY5 million, equivalent to approximately RMB250,000, it would be enough to buy a car."
5047,大尺寸奢华电视一直是各大厂商技术实力的代表，此次拿奖拿到手软的LG带来的77英寸曲面4K OLED电视就是此类产品的典型。,Big screen luxury TVs have always been the hallmark of technological competence of manufacturers. The multiple award winning LG 77-inch curved OLED 4K Smart TV is a classic example of this type of products.
5048,这不仅仅是简单的固定角度曲面电视，而是为用户打造了一个允许自己根据位置调整曲率的复杂装置！,"This is not merely a simple fixed angle curved screen TV, but a complex device that allows the user to adjust the curvature according to the user’s position!"
5049,依托9mm的超薄显示面板，LG让整个平板的变形是肉眼很难发觉的，从而实现最大曲率4000R的最大变量。,"Based on its 9mm ultra thin display screen, LG has made the curvature of the entire screen difficult to detect with the naked eye, thus achieving maximum variation for a maximum 4000R curvature."
5050,用户只需要舒舒服服按动遥控器，就可以让77英寸屏幕的最佳视角随心而动，让它适合任意一个观赏场景。,"Simply press the remote control, and the best angle of the 77-inch screen will move as the user wishes, making it suitable for any viewing scene."
5051,Leica（徕卡）在相机领域中的地位自不必多言，这款徕卡T微单是去年发布的产品，启用了全新的T卡口作为徕卡微单的镜头卡口。,"Leica’s position in the field of cameras is well known. This Leica T mirrorless camera, launched last year, uses the brand new T mount as the lens mount for the Leica mirrorless camera."
5052,除了同期发布的T卡口23mm定焦和18-56mm变焦两支镜头外，还能通过M-Adapter T转接环使用徕卡M系列镜头。,"In addition to the T mount 23mm fixed and 18-56 zoom lenses launched at the same time, the M-Adapter T allows users of the Leica M series of lenses to attach and use the camera as well."
5053,Triumph（黛安芬）准确地抓住了这一问题所在关键之处，研发出新型Magic Wire内衣。,"Triumph has accurately grasped the crux of these issues, and developed the new Magic Wire bra."
5054,由于采用了具有良好支撑性的硅胶树脂材料作为内衣圈托，使穿着者不仅享受到无钢圈内衣的舒适感，还获得了如钢圈内衣般的全方位支撑。,"Using silicone, which offers good support, as the underwire, users not only enjoy the comfort of wire-free bras, but also the all-round support of traditional underwired bras."
5055,再辅以提供更多支撑力的内置网格稳定网，从而实现了内衣的完美贴合，塑造丰满的胸部线条。,It also comes with a built-in mesh stabilizer that provides more support so that the bra is a perfect fit. It also gives the wearer a cleavage.
5056,如今LG的家电都相当有特色，这款CordZero C5吸尘器主打无线追踪功能。,LG’s home appliances have relatively distinct features these days. RoboSense technology is this CordZero C5 vacuum cleaner’s main feature.
5057,吸尘器本身也不含糊，最高提供200瓦吸力，还有个KOMPRESSER集尘压缩技术，能将灰尘聚合为灰块，解决扬尘问题。,The vacuum cleaner is itself a credible machine with maximum suction power of 200 watts. The KOMPRESSER dust compressor technology can compress dust into blocks preventing dust from flying about.
5058,6500QL保持3M产品的一贯的优良品质基础上，采用全新的设计理念。,The 6500QL has adopted a brand new design concept while maintaining the excellent quality that is customary of 3M products.

5074,1月18日，阿里巴巴在重庆召开电商脱贫高峰对话会，宣布通过探索“互联网+脱贫”新模式，助推精准脱贫和乡村振兴。,"On January 18, Alibaba held an e-commerce poverty eradication summit in Chongqing, and announced that it would explore a new “Internet + Poverty eradication” model to help spur measures targeted at eradicating poverty and revitalize the rural economy."
5075,这是继提出乡村战略、启动农村淘宝项目、上线兴农扶贫平台、成立阿里巴巴脱贫基金之后，阿里对脱贫攻坚的再次“加码”。,"This follows Alibaba’s rural strategy, launch of the Rural Taobao program, online rural revitalization and poverty relief platform, as well as the founding of the Alibaba Poverty Relief Fund, and is a step-up commitment by Alibaba toward combating poverty."
5076,脱贫攻坚是当下中国最重要的国家战略之一。,Combating and eradicating poverty is presently one of China’s key national strategies.
5077,全面脱贫在中国过去几千年来从未实现过。,Complete eradication of poverty is unprecedented in the history of China.
5078,“电商扶贫是新一轮扶贫开发的创新举措，是实现精准扶贫、精准脱贫的重要抓手。,“Poverty relief via e-commerce is a new round of innovative measures aimed at poverty relief and development. It is an important means to achieve measures targeted at poverty relief and eradication.
5079,中央高度重视并指出，可以发挥互联网在助推脱贫攻坚中的作用，推进精准扶贫、精准脱贫，让农产品通过互联网走出乡村。”,"The Central government very concerned with this issue and has indicated that the Internet can play a part in helping to combat poverty, advance measures targeted at poverty relief and eradication, as well as allow agricultural products to be sold outside the countryside via the Internet.”"
5080,因此，阿里早在2014年就提出了乡村战略，跟大数据云计算和全球化并列为阿里未来20年三大核心战略。,"As such, Alibaba had proposed a rural strategy as far back as 2014, which together with big data cloud computing and globalization are its three major core strategies for the next 20 years."
5081,同年，阿里启动了农村淘宝（村淘）项目，在乡村招募“村小二”，带领农民通过电商脱贫致富。,"In the same year, Alibaba launched the Rural Taobao program, recruiting “village partners” to help lift villagers out of poverty and move toward affluence by way of e-commerce."
5082,2017年，阿里跟商务部门合作打造兴农扶贫频道，目前累计对接全国13个省份，120个国家级贫困县。,"In 2017, Alibaba worked together with the Ministry of Commerce to create a rural revitalization and poverty relief channel that is now connected to a total of 13 provinces and 120 national level poverty-stricken counties."
5083,阿里平台催生的淘宝村，已经有2118个。,"The Alibaba platform has incubated 2118 Taobao Villages,"
5084,其中，接近400个出现在省贫困县，33个出现在13个国家贫困县。,"of which close to 400 have emerged in poverty-stricken counties of various provinces, and 33 in 13 poverty-stricken provinces."
5085,2017年，在阿里巴巴中国零售平台上，全国淘宝村销售额达到1200亿元。,"In 2017, at Alibaba’s China retail platform, nationwide sales of Taobao Villages amounted to RMB120 billion."
5086,张勇表示，面对脱贫攻坚的国家战略，阿里一直在思考如何用好阿里经济体的科技、大数据、云计算等创新能力，为脱贫走出一条新路来。,"Daniel Zhang said that confronted with the national strategy to combat poverty, Alibaba has been thinking about how it could effectively use the technology, big data, cloud computing and other innovative competencies within the Alibaba economy to help develop a new path for poverty eradication."
5087,其中，村淘是阿里电商脱贫的主要承载平台，并走通了一条直供直销的互联网脱贫新链路。,"Rural Taobao, in particular, is a major platform to help eradicate poverty via e-commerce, and has opened up a new online direct supply and sales link to help eradicate poverty."
5088,在种植环节，村淘和蚂蚁金服联合开展农资农具和小额贷款支持。,"At planting phase, Rural Taobao and Ant Financial Services have jointly offered means to acquire agricultural resources and tools as well as obtain micro-loans."
5089,2017年，在832个国家级贫困县中，蚂蚁金服服务了795个，为其提供便捷的支付、信贷等服务。,"In 2017, of the 832 national-level poverty-stricken counties, 795 were served by Ant Financial Services, which provided convenient payments, credit and other relevant services."
5090,菜鸟解决仓储和物流，天猫负责销售，阿里云的大数据反哺指导农业生产，进一步提高农产品的供应标准、品质和市场竞争力。,"Cainiao helped with warehousing and logistics, while Tmall was responsible for selling. Alibaba Cloud’s big data provided feedback and guidance on agricultural production, further raising the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of the agricultural produce."
5091,电商脱贫的发展，不仅需要产品、销售通道、产业规划，同时还需要人才。,"The growth in poverty eradication via e-commerce not only requires products, sales channels and industry planning, it also requires talent."
5092,阿里通过淘宝大学开设电商课程，给农民传授标准化、品质化和规模化种植方法，实现了“扶贫+扶心智”相结合，让农民可持续脱贫。,"By way of the e-commerce courses conducted by Taobao University, Alibaba teaches farmers standardized, quality and large-scale methods of cultivation, achieving a combination of “Poverty relief + Knowledge support” so that poverty eradication among farmers is sustainable."
5093,这些课程已经覆盖约92%的国家级贫困县。,These courses have already reached approximately 92% of national-level poverty-stricken counties.
5094,而“公益心态、商业手段”的脱贫思路，还能保障阿里在扶贫时做到“真扶贫”。,"The “philanthropic mentality, commercial means” poverty eradication thinking can also ensure that Alibaba will “genuinely perform poverty relief” when carrying out poverty relief activities."
5095,阿里巴巴董事局主席马云曾表示，消除贫困应该分成扶贫、脱贫和致富三个阶段。,"Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma once said that eradicating poverty should be divided into three phases - poverty relief, poverty eradication and becoming affluent."
5096,扶贫是授人以鱼，脱贫是授人以渔，致富是给农民造一个“鱼塘”，让农民有鱼可养。,Poverty relief is to give someone a fish; poverty eradication is to teach someone to fish; and becoming affluent is to build a “fish pond” for farmers so that farmers can breed fish.
5097,电商带动的产业扶贫，就是造鱼塘。,Poverty relief through industry development led by e-commerce is building that fish pond.
5098,在产业扶贫上，阿里跟陕西洛川合作打造的洛川苹果产业扶贫模式，已经被有关部门当作范例在全国复制推广。,"In terms of poverty relief through industry development, Alibaba has partnered Luochuan County in Shaanxi Province to create a Luochuan apple poverty relief through industry development model, which has been replicated and promoted nationwide as a model by relevant departments."
5099,阿里电商扶贫工作也得到了决策层的认可。,Alibaba’s poverty relief via e-commerce initiatives have also won the recognition of decision makers.
5100,以阿里巴巴为代表的电商企业曾被寄语，通过线上线下渠道，确保农民增产增收。,"E-commerce firms, represented by Alibaba, have been given the message that farmers would see an increase in production and income with the help of online and offline channels."
5101,一些村小二和蚂蚁金服员工，还被邀请到联合国和非洲，分享电商脱贫的经验。,Some village partners and Ant Financial staff have also been invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their poverty relief via e-commerce experience.
5102,目前，联合国世界粮食计划署中国办公室已经跟村淘一起，在安徽等地开展电商产业扶贫。,"Currently, the China office of The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has already partnered Rural Taobao in implementing a poverty relief through industry development program in Anhui and other areas."
5103,新浪财经讯 由阿里研究院、中国远见智库论潭共同举办的“第三届新经济智库大会”于1月16日举行，商务部研究院电商所所长张莉出席并发言。,"Sina Finance news. The “3rd New Economy Think Tank Summit” jointly organized by Ali Research Institute and the China Visionary Think Tank Forum was held on January 16.

5104,她认为我们全球化其实忽略了最重要的问题，就是全球化的体与用的问题，还有全球化的阶段问题。,"She believed that our globalization had in fact ignored the most fundamental issues, i.e., those related to the essence and form of globalization, as well as issues associated with phases of globalization."
5105,这样子很多人认为全球化停滞了，而且很多发达国家和发展中国家，在新的阶段里面他们对全球化的态度不一样，是对模式的不一样。,"As a result, many believed that globalization has stagnated. Moreover, in the new phase, many developed and developing countries hold different attitudes toward globalization and its pattern."
5106,第二个概念就是全球化中期阶段的问题，全球化的中期阶段受什么制约呢？,The second concept is concerned with issues related to the intermediate phase of globalization. What constrains the intermediate phase of globalization?
5107,受经济环境基础的制约，正是因为经济基础发生了变化全球化才发生了制约。,The reason why globalization is constrained by the economic environment and fundamentals is precisely because changing economic fundamentals have led to constraints on globalization.
5108,张莉认为，2017年底全球经济调整基本上结束，2018年之后将进入新一轮增长期，下一轮增长一定是生产品拉动。,"Zhang Li believed that adjustments to the global economy have generally come to an end at the end of 2017. A new growth phase, will begin in 2018, and growth will be driven by producer goods."
5109,京东首家生鲜超市7FRESH近日正式开业，计划未来3到5年在全国铺设超过1000家门店。,"JD’s first fresh food supermarket 7FRESH officially opened for business recently, and plans to set up more than 1,000 stores nationwide in three to five years."
5110,加上阿里的盒马鲜生、永辉的超级物种、苏宁的苏鲜生、美团的掌鱼生鲜等，“新零售门店”开始扎堆出现，并在创新模式甚至价格上互相“叫板”。,"Together with Alibaba’s Hema Supermarket, Yonghui Superstores’ Super Species, Suning’s SUFRESH, Meituan’s Zhangyu Store, and others, “new retail outlets” have begun to emerge in clusters, and have even “challenged” each other on price in this innovative model."
5111,生鲜超市争夺战升级，已经成为新零售领域的现象级话题，新零售到底新在哪？,"The fresh food supermarket war has escalated, and have become a phenomenal topic in the new retail sector. Just what is new in new retail?"
5112,“2018年我们会快速进入全国，春节前在北京、上海、杭州会开出一大堆的店。”,"“We will rapidly expand nationwide in 2018, and will open a large number of stores in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival,”"
5113,盒马鲜生CEO侯毅10日在第二届新零售峰会上透露了2018年的“新打法”。,Hema Supermarket CEO Hou Yi revealed the company’s new approach for 2018 at the 2nd New Retail Summit on the 10th.
5114,“从2018年开始，盒马不单单是一家生鲜电商，而是满足消费者即时服务的生活品类电商。,"“With effect from 2018, Hema will not merely be a fresh produce e-commerce firm; rather, we will be a general household goods and grocery e-commerce firm that meets consumers’ requirement for prompt delivery service."
5115,核心模式线下是引流、体验，线上是真正的销售。”,"The core model calls for conduction and experience in offline stores, while genuine sales are done online.”"
5116,区别于传统的大卖场、超市，盒马鲜生在很多消费者眼里是一家好玩好吃的“网红店”，甚至有中介机构打出了“盒区房”的概念。,"Unlike traditional hypermarkets and supermarkets, Hema Supermarket is, in the eyes of many consumers, a popular Internet store that is fun and has good food. Some intermediaries have even come up with the concept of “He district housing” (housing within a 3km radius of a Hema Supermarket)."
5117,线上电商平台和线下零售商各有优缺点，消费者却是在多种渠道出现，所以双方都在尝试全渠道模式。,"Both online e-commerce platforms and offline retail stores have their respective strengths and weaknesses, and consumers are present at various channels. Therefore, both parties are attempting the multi-channel model."
5118,业内认为，在消费升级的大背景下，2018年“类盒马”的门店会越来越多。,"Industry insiders believe that against the general backdrop of consumption upgrading, more “Hema type” stores will be opened in 2018."
5119,而盒马从最初的生鲜不断探索到更多消费领域，预示了在新的一年里，零售市场将出现更多创新。,"Meanwhile, Hema has continued to widen its product scope, expanding from fresh foods initially into other consumer goods. This suggests that more innovation in the retail market will be forthcoming in the new year."
5120,“比如线上线下结合的业务模式，吸引了消费者的眼球，各地开出的生鲜超市叫座又叫好。”,"“For instance, the integrated online-offline business model has attracted consumer eyeballs. Fresh foods supermarkets that have opened across the country have been popular among and welcomed by the masses.”"
5121,“但这些关系说得再多，再炫都没用，最后落实到你是不是给消费者带来了美好的体验，我体验好了才愿意买单。”,"“Nonetheless, these relationships are useless regardless of how much you talk about them or how cool they are. At the end of the day, it’s all about whether or not you have given consumers a good experience. Only after I have had an experience would I be willing to foot the bill.”"
5122,在大润发飞牛网联席CEO袁彬看来，新零售环境下，消费者习惯改变了，购买需求也改变了。,"As far as RT-Mart’s feiniu.com CEO Yuan Bin is concerned, under the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed; and shopping requirements have changed as well."
5123,原来纯线上、线下是割裂的，线下要打败线上，线上要反攻线下，现在是一起牵手，因为消费者已经没有线上线下的区分了。,"Originally, there was a clear demarcation between online and offline; offline wanted to defeat online, and online wanted to counter-attack offline. Now, on the other hand, it’s become a partnership, because consumers no longer see a difference between online and offline."
5124,资本的争相入局，让目前以生鲜超市为代表的新零售火药味十足。,"Capital, competing for a slice of the pie, has made the retail market, represented by fresh food supermarkets, a powder keg."
5125,分析认为，目前新零售在一线城市的竞争还远未到红海的格局，而且还有大片的二线城市尚待挖掘，市场仍有很大机会和空间。,"Analysis shows that at present, new retail competition in Tier 1 cities is still a long way from a red ocean situation, and there is still plenty of Tier 2 cities yet to be explored. Enormous opportunities and potential exist in the market."
5126,不同类型的行业对于新零售的布局，会将新零售的发展带入一个多元化的发展状态。,New retail plans proposed by different types of industries will lead new retail development into a state of diversified growth.
5127,央视财经频道联合中国社科院财经战略研究院，给大家梳理了一份干货，就是这份沉甸甸的中国电商年度发展报告。,"CCTV-2 and the National Academy of Economic Strategy, CASS have compiled a stack of dry goods, i.e., this weighty annual report on the development of the e-commerce industry in China."
5128,这一年来，中国电商出了一份怎样的成绩单？,What sort of report card did China’s e-commerce industry receive this year?
5129,全球电商又都有哪些发展趋势？,What are the growth trends of the global e-commerce industry?
5130,我们来一一为大家揭晓。,Let us reveal the results one by one.
5131,销售总量再破记录增速重回加速轨道,Total sales volume set a new record while growth returned to the acceleration track
5132,从2006年开始，我国网上零售额可以说一直呈现超高速增长，估计是那会儿觉得网购很新鲜，不出门也能买东西，太酷了！,China’s online retail sales have been sky rocketing since 2006. This may be attributed to the fact that online shopping was still a very novel idea at the time. Shopping without leaving home; cool!
5133,但从2013年开始，网上零售增速开始降至50%以下，2015年，增速首次低于40%，2016年增速居然变成了26.2%。,"Since 2013 however, the online retail sales growth rate has decelerated from more than 50% to less than 40% for the first time in 2015; in 2016, the growth rate was 26.2%."
5134,但是今年情况就不一样了，网上零售额重新加速，今年1-9月份，增速回升至34.2 %。,"The situation changed this year, however. Online retail sales accelerated again. For the first nine months of this year, growth rate rebounded to 34.2%,"
5135,大大高于2015年、2016年的增长率。,significantly higher than the growth rates seen in 2015 and 2016.
5136,可能大家在外兜兜转转一圈，发现还是买买买更让人身心愉悦。,Perhaps shoppers took a detour but eventually realized that retail therapy does wonders for one’s mind and body.
5137,其中，实物商品网上零售额近5.08万亿元，服务网上零售额近1.49万亿元。,"In particular, online retail sales of physical goods amounted to approximately RMB5.08 trillion, while online retail sales of services amounted to nearly RMB1.49 trillion."
5138,在社会商品总零售额中占比达到13.6 %，同比提高近3个百分点。,"This comprised 13.6% of total retail sales of consumer goods, up nearly 3 percentage points year-on-year."
5139,同学们，别打瞌睡，划重点了，服务网上零售额绝对是一大功臣啊！,"Wake up, students. It’s time to highlight the key points. Online retail sales of services was definitely a major contributor!"
5140,其次爱剁手的法国网民，人均网购额为1925美元，而他们网购最多的商品，是服装，不愧是爱时尚的国度。,"Elsewhere, per capita online shopping of French netizens who are obsessed with online shopping amounted to US$1,925. Goods they purchased online are primarily clothing, worthy of being called a nation of fashion lovers."
5141,最爱网购的，一定是年轻人吗？,Who says those who love online shopping most must be young?
5142,帮助您避免公司成为下一个优步的初创公司,The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
5143,艾米·埃雷特曾经想在她的电子商务初创公司调查员工的幸福感，但调查没什么作用。,"Amy Errett wanted to gauge employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but surveys weren't working."
5144,得到的回复往往都语焉不详，毫无助益，甚至更糟的是还有欺骗性的回复。,"Responses were often vague, unhelpful or, worse, deceitful."
5145,即使她承诺采用匿名形式，但是有些员工仍然不信任这一过程。,"And even if she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process."
5146,埃雷特负责管理 75 人的旧金山电子商务护发公司 Madison Reed，她表示“得到的回复缺乏一致性和客观性”。,"""It just never had consistency and objectivity,"" said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed."
5147,所以她打电话对外求助。,So she called in outsiders for help.
5148,一批新的人力资源初创公司如雨后春笋般涌现，帮助公司了解员工的感受。,A new breed of human resources start-ups is cropping up to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
5149,他们构建并授权专门用于衡量员工参与度的软件，从而使得公司可以针对特定团队和人口群体快速进行民意测验，为员工提供匿名和投诉热线，并且在某些情况下允许举报人绕过高管直接报告给董事会。,"By building and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, they allow companies to do snap polls, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistle-blowers to bypass C-suite executives and go straight to the board of directors."
5150,“现在，你可以用 Strava 和 Fitbit 等工具来追踪你的健康状况，但是公司的 Fitbit 在哪里呢？”红木城创业公司 Glint 的联合创始人兼首席执行官吉姆·巴内特表示。Glint 软件分析工具被各家公司用来衡量员工敬业度。,"""You've now got tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?"" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement."
5151,埃雷特表示在三年内，她用 Glint 获得了对员工想法和感受的更多见解。,Errett said she gained more insight into what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years using Glint.
5152,除了特定团队的快速调查和民意调查之外，Glint 还提供公司热图，哪些单位投诉最多，哪些经理批准分数低，一目了然 – 这让她能够深入了解原因。,"In addition to the snap surveys and polls of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company showing at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - allowing her to drill down on why."
5153,各家公司开始意识到他们必须熟练掌控公司的职场文化，以免成为下一个优步。优步前员工之前发表了一篇博客文章描述骚扰环境，这些发言者被公司惩罚，之后优步便陷入了丑闻。,"Companies are coming to realize they must stay on top of their workplace culture, lest they become the next Uber, which has been enmeshed in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke out were punished."
5154,对于像 Glint 这样的初创公司来说，公司这种监督愿望是一个钱途无量的商机。,"For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity."
5155,"根据金融技术分析网站 Let's Talk Payments 的数据，到 2020 年，全球治理、监管和合规行业的价值可能会超过 1,187 亿美元。","The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to finance tech insights website Let's Talk Payments."
5156,科罗拉多州丹佛的初创企业 Convercent 致力于帮助公司防止和发现不良行为，在今年早些时候优步声誉受损期间，他们看到了此方面兴趣和活动的增加。,"Denver, Colo., start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an uptick in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's fall into disrepute."
5157,Convercent 拥有近 600 个客户，其中包括爱彼迎、微软和特斯拉。,"Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla."
5158,优步最近签约成为客户。,Uber recently signed up as a client.
5159,与 Glint 一样，Convercent 可以让公司发送定制化的“诊断”调查，实时收集机密回应，查看其问题区域的热图。,"Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized ""pulse"" surveys, gather confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of its problem areas."
5160,Convercent 还提供匿名短信热线，让员工上报不良行为。,It also offers an anonymous texting hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.
5161,如果董事长受到牵连，那么投诉将直接进入董事会。,"And if the chief executive is implicated, complaints go straight to the board of directors."
5162,Convercent 的创始人兼首席执行官帕特里克·昆兰表示：“舆论法庭篡夺了监管机构的权力。,"""The court of public opinion has usurped regulators,"" said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent."
5163,如果一家公司被发现对待员工不善或者对员工表现不道德，即使监管机构不介入，这家公司也可能面临消费者抵制、员工流失和卷入诉讼的高昂后果，昆兰表示。,"If a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave unethically, even if regulators don't step in, it can face costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee attrition and lawsuits, Quinlan said."
5164,"Ruby Tuesday 是一家横跨 500 多个地方并拥有超过 25,000 名员工的餐饮连锁店，已使用 Convercent 一年多，确保员工了解工作准则与工作规程，提供联系公司总部的轻松途径。","Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters."
5165,在此之前，如果员工想要报告问题，必须找到公司总部电话号码或电子邮件，提出正式投诉，并希望总部能对此予以认真对待。,"Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters, lodge a formal complaint, and hope it was taken seriously."
5166,这往往是一种令人畏惧而不安的经历，Ruby Tuesday 的法律总顾问詹姆斯·维特拉诺如是说，他认为并没有一种好的方法可以追踪员工的投诉。,"It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was no good way of tracking employee complaints."
5167,但现在该公司使用 Convercent，就能更快地发现和解决之前位于远距离办公室、城市或州的高管所不知道的问题 - 如歧视、骚扰或不公平的工资行为。,"Now that the company is using Convercent, though, problems that were previously hidden from executives who sat in offices cities or states away - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed."
5168,“我可以更近地、360 度全方位地了解工作体验，”负责 Ruby Tuesday 风险管理团队的维特拉诺说道。,"""I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience,"" said Vitrano, who oversees Ruby Tuesday's risk management group."
5169,“我们正在保护我们的股东免受就业诉讼。”,"""And we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."""
5170,昆兰表示，在安道尔会计师事务所因安然丑闻违反道德规范而倒闭后，各家公司从 2002 年开始更加重视道德、价值观和员工敬业度。,"Companies started taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations from the Enron scandal, Quinlan said."
5171,但直到“社交媒体走入了自己的世界”之后，各家公司才意识到他们无法阻止他们的爆料在网上病毒式传播。,"But it wasn't until ""social media came into its own"" that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going viral online."
5172,“在使用技术监测道德之前，人们把希望视为一种策略，”他说。,"""Prior to using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy,"" he said."
5173,Glint 和 Convercent 均将其软件作为服务提供，并向各家公司收取产品使用的经常性费用。,"Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees to use their products."
5174,这种商业模式和商业机会得到风险投资者的支持，这些投资者已经为这两家初创公司提供支持。,"It's a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors, who have propped up both start-ups."
5175,2 月份，Convercent 从 Sapphire Ventures 和 Tola Capital 等公司筹集了 1000 万美元的资金，其总资本上升至 4700 万美元。,"Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital raised to $47 million."
5176,11 月份，Glint 从 Bessemer Venture Partners 获得了 1000 万美元的资金，其总资金达到 6000 万美元。,"Glint secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million."
5177,鉴于公司、文化和风险投资之间的相互关联性，这些投资几乎不会让人感到惊讶。,"These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital."
5178,越来越多的研究表明，今天的员工对工作场所的期望比以前更高。,There's a growing body of research showing today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
5179,在像硅谷这样竞争激烈的市场中，高薪水和有趣的项目仅仅是赌注。,"In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are merely table stakes."
5180,员工希望感受到他们被接受、被重视，感受到他们的时间花在一个有积极使命的公司身上。,Employees want to feel that they're accepted and valued and that they're giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
5181,“当人们乐于加入公司、感受到他们的声音被聆听、他们所做的工作是有益的，他们就会更加致力于让公司取得成功，”LinkedIn 全球福利和员工体验副总裁妮娜·麦卡特尼表示。LinkedIn 同时使用 Convercent 和 Glint 这两款软件。,"""When people are happy to be at a company, feel their voices are heard, and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to making that company successful,"" said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint."
5182,投资者在其投资组合公司表现良好时实现回报；公司在员工忠诚和敬业时表现良好。,Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.
5183,如果第三方分析工具承诺增加员工的忠诚度和敬业度，他们会寻找财务支持也就不足为怪了。,"If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they're finding backing."
5184,工作场所文化专家称，掌握员工敬业度数据非常重要。,"Having data on employee engagement is important, according to workplace culture experts."
5185,但是，除非公司的管理员采取行动，否则这些数据毫无用处。,But the data are useless unless a company's custodians take action.
5186,事实上，如果一家公司要求员工提供反馈意见，就可以预期这家公司正在进行变革。,"In fact, if a company asks employees for their feedback, it can set an expectation that change is on the way."
5187,如果变革进展得不够快，或者没有一点进展，则可能会带来失望，并导致员工脱离公司。,"And if change doesn't come fast enough, or at all, it can breed disappointment and make employees disengaged."
5188,商业管理公司科特国际公司的咨询业务主管拉塞尔·拉思表示：“如果你想寻求 4000 条建议，那么你需要准备好进行 4000 次对话。”他看到过一些公司过分依赖数据采集的错误。,"""If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations,"" said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection."
5189,“因为如果不全程跟进，员工就会想，‘你真的听到我说的了吗？,"""Because if you don't follow through, employees will wonder, 'Did you really hear me?"
5190,你在乎吗？,Do you care?
5191,如果你不在乎，我为什么要在乎呢？’”,"And if you don't care, why should I care?' """
5192,埃雷特表示，Madison Reed 现在每月进行员工调查，已经能够在 Glint 报告问题的当天采取行动。,"Madison Reed, which now does monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on Glint, according to Errett."
5193,收集员工有关他们因决策速度和沟通质量而受挫的反馈意见之后，她就能够通过重组公司内部团队、增加沟通培训来解决问题。,"And, after gathering feedback from employees frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues."
5194,Ruby Tuesday 公司正在获取对其员工的新见解，从长远来看，他们希望能够在这个以高人才流失率著称的行业中作出转变，更好地保留员工。,"Over at Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insight on its employees, and it's hoping that in the long run, this will convert to better retention of workers in an industry known for high turnover."
5195,“如果你不致力于创造透明文化，你会失去人才，”维特拉诺说道。,"""If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people,"" Vitrano said."
5196,“如果你失去了人才，你就将失去客户。,"""And if you lose people, you're going to lose customers."
5197,而当你失去客户时，你就将失去公司。”,"And when you lose customers, you're going to lose companies."""
5198,今年游泳世界杯的赛事回归25米短池，由9个分站比赛组成，比2015年多一个欧洲站。,This year the swimming events of World Cup will return to the 25-meter short pool. It will consist of 9 sub-station races and one more European station than 2015.
5199,作为曾在2010年广州亚军会斯诺克项目中击败丁俊晖，获得该项目金牌的世界级选手，傅家俊应该是香港现役运动员中知名度最高的斯诺克球手。,"As a world-class player who defeated Ding Junhui in Snooker Project of the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games and won the gold medal in this project, Marco Fu should be the most famous Snooker player among the active athletes in Hong Kong."
5200,由国家语言资源监测与研究中心、商务印书馆、人民网主办的“汉语盘点2016”揭晓仪式今天在京举行。,"The unveiling ceremony of “Taking Stock of the Chinese Language 2016”, jointly hosted by the National Language Resources Monitoring and Research Center, Commercial Press and people.cn, was held in Beijing today."
5201,斯特林争议进球绝杀阿森纳，之于此前3轮2场败北的曼城，着实是一针太及时的强心剂。,"Sterling's controversial goal defeated Arsenal, which is really a timely and inspiring attempt for Manchester City after losing two battles in the three matches before."
5202,本报讯（记者卢波）5月12日，副市长陈绿平赴永川，就该区落实整改中央环保督察反馈意见和临江河流域综合治理进行调研，并举行座谈会。 据了解，为扎实抓好中央环保督察反馈意见整改工作，永川区成立了工作领导小组，将整改任务分解到21个区级牵头部门和23个牵头镇街，相关整改工作已全面启动。,"(Reporter: Lu Bo) On May 12, Deputy Mayor Chen Lvping arrived at Yongchuan to inspect the status of the implementation of rectifications from the feedback and opinions of the Central Environmental Inspection Group as well as the comprehensive treatment of river basins by the region, as well as to hold a forum. It was understood that Yongchuan had set up a task force for the purpose of conscientiously carrying out the rectification task resulting from the feedback and opinions of the Central Environmental Inspection Group. The rectification task was broken down into 21 regional-level leading departments, and 23 leading towns and streets. The relevant rectification has fully commenced."
5203,都市情感商业大剧《鸡毛飞上天》正在江苏卫视热播，该剧讲述了三代人既艰辛曲折又充满激情的创业史和情感史故事。,Urban romance-business drama “Feather Flies To The Sky” has been a big hit on Jiangsu Television. The drama tells the story of the arduous and passionate entrepreneurial history and romance of three generations of people.
5204,这位出生于上世纪40年代的话剧导演，是业界德高望重的老前辈，话剧金狮奖得主，享受国务院特殊津贴。,"This director of plays, who was born in the 1940s, is a highly respected elder in the performing arts circle. He was a winner of the Golden Lion Award, and was entitled to special subsidy from the State Council."
5205,男子50米仰泳，中国选手徐嘉余以23秒54的成绩排名第八，日本选手谷赫纯也以22秒85夺冠。,"In the men's 50-meter backstroke, Koga Junya from Japan won the champion with 22'85 and Chinese athlete Xu Jiayu ranked eighth with 23'54."
5206,NCAA 取消每日两次的训练，延长熊队白天的训练时间,The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices makes for a long day for the Bruins
5207,时间接近晚上 11 点，加州大学洛杉矶分校足球队队员在球队新的校园练习场旁边徘徊聊天。,It's pushing 11 p.m. as a throng of UCLA football players linger to chat on one side of the team's new on-campus practice fields.
5208,有些球员已经脱下运动衫，露出集训营第一天努力训练后汗流浃背的身体。,"Some have peeled off their jersey tops, revealing backs slick with sweat from the toil of the first day of training camp."
5209,对于球队中很大一部分人来说，这空闲的几分钟就是休息时间。,"For a good chunk of the team, these idle minutes constitute a midday break."
5210,参加夏季课程的球员在三小时练习后将返回宿舍备考期末考试，然后第二天早上 6:30 返回 Wasserman 足球中心参加会议。,Players enrolled in summer classes will head back to their dorms after the three-hour practice to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 the following morning.
5211,“接下来的三天对这些家伙是一种磨合，”熊队教练吉姆·莫拉在周一即将进入周二时说道。,"""This is a grind for these guys the next three days,"" Bruins coach Jim Mora said not long before Monday turned into Tuesday."
5212,NCAA 取消了每日两次练习（旨在减轻球员负担），但实际上延长了他们白天的训练时间 - 至少在周五结束之前。,"The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices, designed to lighten the load on players, has actually lengthened their days - at least until finals end Friday."
5213,这就是为什么加州大学洛杉矶分校的前三次训练定于下午 7 点 15 分开始，以适应球员已经挤塞的时间表。,That's why UCLA's first three practices were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players' already crammed schedules.
5214,从取消一天两次训练到更多地进行一天一次训练，熊队在上个赛季前差不多一个星期展开训练，莫拉在韦斯特伍德的六个赛季中首次于暑期学校进行训练。,"The trade-off from no two-a-days is more one-a-days, the Bruins pushing up the start of camp nearly a week from last season and holding practices during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood."
5215,他们计划从 8 月 20 日开始进行 18 场训练，然后再开始为 9 月份首战德州农工进行正式比赛做赛前准备。,They are scheduled to hold 18 practices through Aug. 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A&amp;M on Sept.
5216,莫拉说，他支持 NCAA 的规则调整，虽然这样会让球员繁忙的行程又增加了另一个项目。,Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change even if it did add another item to players' busy itineraries.
5217,“三或四天时间内，我们会给他们施加巨大的训练量，非常具有挑战性，”莫拉说道。,"""We're putting this enormous load on them for three or four days and it's very challenging,"" Mora said."
5218,“他们也刚刚通过。他们在磨练，他们都是很棒的孩子。,"""And they've just pushed through it; they grind, they're great kids."
5219,我想到了周六，我们就会有更多时间，真的很棒。”,"I think once we get to Saturday and we'll have more time, it will really be great."""
5220,集训营一结束，加州大学洛杉矶分校就会停止训练。考虑到邻近的停车场和 Luskin Center 的清晰视线，这不是一个容易的任务。Luskin Center 高级酒店已被穿过球门柱后防护网的足球投掷得遍体鳞伤。,"UCLA will close its practices once camp is finished, no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost."
5221,本周末开始，熊队队员将住在酒店。但莫拉承认，一旦这些房间在赛季中空置，可能会出现问题。,"Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel beginning this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be an issue once those rooms are vacant during the season."
5222,“我们会采取安保措施，”莫拉说。,"""We will have security,"" Mora said."
5223,“这是一个真正令人担忧的问题。认为有人可能会租一个房间、坐在房间里录制训练场景，这个想法并不牵强。,"""That is a real concern and it's not far-fetched to think that people can rent a room and sit up there and videotape a practice."
5224,如果你有训练录像带，也相当不错。,"If you have videotape of a practice, it's a pretty good deal."
5225,但是我们在那里会采安保措施，在 8 号停车场也会采取安保措施。,But we'll have security there and we'll have security up in Parking Lot 8.
5226,我们会利用现有资源，做到最好。,We'll do the best we can with what we got.
5227,对此，我不会过多担心。,I'm not going to worry too much about it.
5228,我们已经制定好了计划。”,"We have a plan in place."""
5229,澳洲统计局(ABS)数据显示，今年第二季度，全澳房屋价值平均上涨1.5%至2%，年增3.5%，创自2013年3月以来最低年增率。,"Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) revealed that in the second quarter of this year, residential property prices in Australia nationwide rose by an average of 1.5% to 2%, and were 3.5% higher on an annual basis, the lowest annual growth rate since March 2013."
5230,就在房产中介期待在节日季出售更多房产之际，澳洲房价增幅却创2013年以来最低水平。,"Just when real estate agents were looking forward to selling more real estate during the holiday season, growth rate of residential property prices was the lowest since 2013."
5231,IT之家上午报道，华尔街日报消息称AT&amp;T已经取消计划在美国销售华为新旗舰智能手机的计划。,IT Home reported this morning that Wall Street Journal claimed that AT&amp;T has canceled plans to sell Huawei’s new flagship smart phone in the US.
5232,华为原计划本周在CES上宣布该合作关系，AT&amp;T在最后一刻取消了这一合作。,"Huawei’s original plan was to announce this partnership at the CES this week, but AT&amp;T canceled the partnership at the last minute."
5233,针对这一情况，华为方面1月9日回应澎湃新闻记者表示，美国当地时间1月9日，华为将向美国市场发布新产品以及具体上市信息。,"In a January 9 response to a Bloomberg reporter as regards this turn of events (January 9 US local time), Huawei said that it would release its new product and specific listing information to the US market."
5234,华为表示，过去5年，华为已通过在全球和美国市场推出高端产品，证明自己的实力。,"Huawei indicated that in the past five years, it has already launched high-end products worldwide and in the US market, proving its strength and competence."
5235,据IT之家此前的报道，华为将于1月9日下午在拉斯维加斯CES大展上发布一款“你从未听说过的最好手机”，并且这款手机的续航能力能够支撑两天的使用。,"According to the earlier IT Home report, Huawei will unveil the “best smartphone you’ve never heard of” in the afternoon of January 9 at the CES held in Las Vegas.

5237,羊城晚报记者王莉由范冰冰领衔，郭涛、大鹏、张嘉译等主演的电影《我不是潘金莲》将于9月30日全国上映。,"Yangcheng Evening News reporter Wang Li. The film “I Am Not Madame Bovary” starring Fan Bingbing, as well as Guo Tao, Da Peng, Zhang Jiayi and others, will be released nationwide on September 30."
5238,昨天，该片在北京举行“喜剧的忧伤”主题研讨会，冯小刚、宁浩、大鹏三位嘉宾出席活动。,"Yesterday, the film held a workshop with the theme “Sorrow in Comedies” in Beijing. Feng Xiaogang, Ning Hao and Da Peng attended the event."
5239,构图方圆交替，导演就是任性《我不是潘金莲》的特别之处，是构图方圆交替，特别是以遮罩镜头拍出的圆形画面很有新鲜感。,"Alternating circular and square image composition; the director was simply willful What was special about “I Am Not Madame Bovary” was the alternating circular and square image compositions. In particular, the circular frames shot with a hooded lens were fresh and interesting."
5240,冯小刚解释：“这个题材跟张艺谋导演的《秋菊打官司》很像，大家很容易联想到一块儿，我就想怎么用大家没用过的方式去拍。其实没有什么特别的想法，就是觉得好玩，想干点出格的事。”,"Feng Xiaogang explained, “ This theme was very similar to Director Zhang Yimou’s “The Story of Qiu Ju”, so it’s very easy for many to lump the two together. So I started to think how I should shoot the film using a method no one has used before. Actually, it wasn’t really a very special idea. I just thought it’d be fun to do something a little different.”"
5241,冯小刚称自己把作品当成处女作，跟摄影师学习怎么拍圆形画面，甚至花了几百万元让摄影师拍了一个十分钟的试片。,"Feng Xiaogang said he regarded the work as his maiden work, and learned how to shoot circular frames from the camera people. He even spent a few million to allow the camera people to shoot a 10-minute pilot."
5242,脸书将推出事实核查功能，打击虚假新闻,Facebook to step up fact-checking in fight against fake news
5243,脸书在周四宣称，将发送更多潜在恶作剧文章给第三方检测机构，并在原帖下方展示检测结果。脸书这一全球最大的在线社交网络正试图打击所谓的假新闻。,"Facebook is to send more potential hoax articles to third-party fact checkers and show their findings below the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday as it tries to fight so-called fake news."
5244,脸书公司在其网站的声明中表示，脸书将开始使用更新的机器来学习检测可能的恶作剧并将其发送给事实核查器，并可能在原帖下方显示事实核查结果。,"The company said in a statement on its website it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes and send them to fact checkers, potentially showing fact-checking results under the original article."
5245,脸书被批评为所谓假新闻的主要传播点之一，许多人认为脸书影响了 2016 年美国总统大选。,"Facebook has been criticized as being one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election."
5246,这个问题也成为欧洲的一个重大政治话题，法国五月份总统选举前，选民遭遇了虚假故事的泛滥，德国则率先在九月选举前通过了对罚款计划的支持，如果社交媒体网络未能及时删除仇恨帖，则会被处以罚款。,"The issue has also become a big political topic in Europe, with French voters deluged with false stories ahead of the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to fine social media networks if they fail to remove hateful postings promptly, ahead of elections there in September."
5247,脸书周四在德国的一份单独声明中表示，正在美国、法国、荷兰和德国启动一项新的事实核查功能测试。,"On Thursday Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking feature was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany."
5248,脸书新闻馈送产品经理莎拉·苏在一篇博客中表示：“除了看到哪些故事受到第三方事实核查员的质疑外，人们还希望有更多的背景来帮助他们对阅读和分享的内容做出明智的决定。,"""In addition to seeing which stories are disputed by third-party fact checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share,"" said Sara Su, Facebook news feed product manager, in a blog."
5249,她补充说，脸书将继续测试其“相关文章”功能，并对其新闻提要进行其他更改以减少虚假新闻。,"She added that Facebook would keep testing its ""related article"" feature and work on other changes to its news feed to cut down on false news."
5250,创作一部绘图小说：英格兰城堡的故事,Building a graphic novel: A Castle in England's story
5251,最近，小巧的斯科特尼城堡在压缩版音乐影片中成为主角，并一度成为玛格丽特·撒切尔 (Margaret Thatcher) 夫人在七八十年代期间的避难所。,"In its recent past, the diminutive Scotney Castle has featured in a Squeeze music video and been a bolthole for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s."
5252,但是斯科特尼在肯特州贝乐河峡谷舒适的位置上目睹了 700 年的动荡历史，现在它则成为由杰米·罗德斯 (Jamie Rhodes) (一个对历史文件有特别爱好、留着拖把头的约克郡人) 所写图形小说的灵感来源。,"But Scotney has witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history from its cosy seat in Bewl River valley in Kent, now inspiration for a graphic novel written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents."
5253,“可以看到 300 年前古人的笔迹，我发现这真是太美了 ”，他满眼向往地说道。,"""I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years,"" he says wistfully."
5254,“这是什么样的人际缘分才能让这封信落在我手上。”,"""What a personal connection, to hold that letter in my hand."""
5255,跨越中世纪直到爱德华时代，“一座英格兰城堡”读本记录了居在斯科特尼的各个家族，每个故事都是由不同的、英国未来的艺术家如 Isaac Lenkiewicz、Briony May Smith、William Exley、Becky Palmer，以及 Isabel Greenberg 所作。,"Spanning the middle ages to the Edwardian era, A Castle in England documents the families that lived in Scotney, with each story illustrated by a different, upcoming UK artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."
5256,这并不是罗兹第一本以档案为原材料的书：他还写了《2014 年死人的牙齿和其他故事》，这是一本受英国图书馆文献启发而作的图书，这是一个他受到无法控制的创作激情而完成的作品。,"It is not Rhodes's first book based on an archive: he also wrote 2014's Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional."
5257,他说：“我在看到信件一侧留下的拇指印记那刻起就不可抑制自己的写作冲动，该封信是一位 18 世纪为雅各布派工作的双重特工所写。”,"""I welled up at just the thumbprint on the side of a letter, written by a double agent in the 1700s who was working for the Jacobites,"" he says."
5258,“那是他的指纹！,"""That's his thumbprint!"
5259,而且信件一直闻起来有股烟味，因为那时候，你需要点火才能有光亮。,"And letters always smell like smoke because, back then, you lit a fire for light."
5260,对于300年后的我们来说，这种气味让人感觉他们也在我们身边。,"To someone 300 years in the future, the smell makes it feel like they're there, too."
5261,噢，我喜欢档案文献！”,"Ah, I love archives!"""
5262,对于那些被旧纸张打动的人来说，可以得到英格兰国家信托和艺术委员会的支持并在城堡里生活了将近四个月 (“说实话，我呆的时间有点久了”) 似乎太棒了，简直不相信是真的。,"For someone so smitten with old papers, getting support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and living in a castle for almost four months (""I overstayed my welcome a little bit, to be honest"") seems too good to be true."
5263,罗兹耗费了数天时间参观浏览维多利亚的“新”城堡，翻阅档案、研究庄园的许多宝藏和古玩，比如挂在墙上的鬣狗头，以及在护城河中度过了几个世纪的瓶子等等。,"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian ""new"" castle, going through the archives and studying the manor's many treasures and curios, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat."
5264,他漫步在旧城堡的土地和废墟上，与流浪者、园丁，有时候与为他书中绘制插图艺术家聊天。,"He wandered the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, talking to rangers, gardeners and sometimes the artists at work on his book's illustrations."
5265,然后到了晚上，他就会“喝点威士忌，然后写作。”,"Then at night, he'd ""drink whiskey and get writing."""
5266,斯科特尼的隐秘历史还不是很清楚，因为“英国国民信托组织” (National Trust) 只有在 2006 年最后的继承人伊丽莎白·赫西去世后才完全进入。,"The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust had only gained full access in 2006 when the final heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died."
5267,十年后，当罗兹到来时，工作人员才开始处理档案，他把它们形容为“数百年前的贵族们要走了：“哦，把它放在阁楼里吧'。”,"When Rhodes arrived a decade later, staff were only starting to tackle the archive, which he describes as ""hundreds of years of aristocrats going: 'Oh, stick it in the loft'."""
5268,日记、来自英国帝国时代的信件、描绘了各个国家疆域的地图：“你会认为土地纠纷会很无聊 ”，罗兹说，“但是会发生两个家族会为了一棵白桦树而大打出手。,"Diaries, letters from the days of the English empire, maps outlining who owned what: ""You'd think land disputes would be boring,"" says Rhodes, ""but there was this one birch tree two families were fighting over."
5269,放手吧，伙计们！”,"Just let it go, guys!"""
5270,该作品中的一些故事以城堡作为起点，进而来更广泛的层面研究英国的历史，其中包括《劳动者》 (The Labourer) ，该故事以一名离开新建城堡参加1381年农民起义的人为线索。,"Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a jumping-off point to delve more broadly into English history, including The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Peasants' Revolt."
5271,“书中名为《肯特和苏塞克斯的骑士家族》 (Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex) ”的故事记录了 1380 年在城堡里发生的一场暴乱 ”，罗兹说道。,"""There is a record of a riot happening at the castle in 1380, in this book called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,"" says Rhodes."
5272,“农民起义开始于那个地区，而我认为那里是发动起义的好地方。,"""The Peasants' Revolt started in that area and I thought, a riot is a good place to start."
5273,也许这这两者存在关联？”,"Maybe the two are connected?"""
5274,其他的故事深深植根于城堡的历史， 例如《牧师》 (The Priest) ，它讲述了达雷尔家族在英国宗教改革时期隐匿一名耶稣会牧师达七年之久的故事。,"Other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - such as The Priest, which tells the tale of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation."
5275,或者《走私者》 (The Smuggler) ，该故事的主人翁是 18 世纪的走私者亚瑟?达雷尔，他被认为是通过用石块装满棺材给自己举行葬礼 (数年后他的棺材露出地面，人们才发觉) 。,"Or The Smuggler, which features 18th-century contrabander Arthur Darrell, who is thought to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with rocks (a discovery made years later when his coffin was unearthed)."
5276,《达雷尔家族》 (The Darrells) 是罗兹最喜欢的斯科特尼城堡家族：“这些先生们似乎很无赖，总是不断地借钱，再花钱买他们买不起的东西。,"The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite Scotney family: ""The gentlemen seemed to be quite roguish, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford."
5277,一代又一代的达雷尔男人通过嫁给富有的老女人来解决他们的债务问题，我想他们应该是一群英俊的小伙子，懂得如何追求女人。”,"Different generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of handsome guys, with a knack for wooing heiresses."""
5278,随着他在城堡中的任务结束，罗兹开始寻找其他奇异的写作经历。,"With his assignment in the castle over, Rhodes is on the hunt for other singular writing experiences."
5279,他在芬兰的荒野里用两周时间完成了一部绘图小说，内容是关于“El?¤m?¤nm?¤ki”，那是一个 20 世纪早期疗养院，后来它慢慢被废弃了。,"He has completed a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness for a graphic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature."
5280,但斯科特尼对他而言有着特殊的地位。,But Scotney holds a special place for him.
5281,“我很伤心地离开”，他说。,"""I was sad to leave,"" he says."
5282,“这就像是：'噢，我得去面对槽糕的现实生活中。'”,"""It was like: 'Ah, I've got to go deal with fucking real life now.'"""
5283,据澎湃新闻记者了解，中兴智能汽车团队总部设在珠海，操盘人为中兴通讯执行副总裁田文果。,"Bloomberg reporters learned that ZTE Smart Auto’s headquarters will be established in Zhuhai, and the company will be headed by Tian Wenguo, Executive Vice President of ZTE Corporation."
5284,大型能源公司个个都“富可敌国”，那么全球众多能源公司中谁最趁钱呢？,All large energy companies are “extremely wealthy”. So which energy company in the world makes the most money?
5285,昨日，著名的PFC能源公司公布了2011年上市能源公司50强排名，美国石油天然气生产商埃克森美孚以4063亿美元的市值蝉联冠军，中国石油和荷兰皇家壳牌紧随之后。,"Yesterday, PFC Energy published its 2011 list of the Top 50 largest listed energy companies. US oil and gas producer ExxonMobil retained its top position with a market valuation of US$406.3 billion, closely followed by PetroChina and Royal Dutch Shell."

5288,根据PFC的统计，不过，尽管目前的油价远比4年前要高，对此，PFC能源公司CEO指出，导致总市值低的原因有很多，主要包括北美天然气价格的下降，以及全球股票市场的活跃度低。,"According to PFC’s statistics, ... Nonetheless, although current oil prices are far higher than that four years ago, PFC Energy’s CEO said that the lower combined market valuation was attributable to a number of factors, including lower North American natural gas prices, and less buoyant global stock markets."
5289,据新华社报道，京津冀及周边地区从16日开始的重污染天气到了19日进一步加剧，河北石家庄、辛集、邯郸3市AQI出现“爆表”。,"Xinhua News Agency reported that heavily polluted weather will descend on Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and surrounding regions from the 16th and worsen by the 19th.

5305,活动不仅得到了区烟草局全体干部职工的支持，还吸引了退休老干部、职工家属一并参与环保实践，老青少三代齐心协力、登山护林、清扫垃圾，为建设“美丽南岳”奉献自己的一份力量。,"The event received the support of all the cadres and staff of the district Tobacco Administration, and also attracted retired cadres as well as the staff’s families, who came to participate in the environmental protection activities. Three generations of people from the elderly to children worked together, hiked up the mountain to protect the forests, and cleaned up rubbish, contributing their own effort to building a “beautiful Nanyue”."

5308,在常年报道乒羽项目的记者们眼中，“藏獒”张继科早就具备了成为下一个林丹的潜质。,"In the eyes of reporters who have been reporting on table tennis and badminton all year long, “Tibetan mastiff” Zhang Jike has already had the potential to become the next Lin Dan."

5311,性爱机器人确在兴起，但我们应慎重,"The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be concerned"
5312,就在你觉得 2017 年不会更诡异的时候，性爱机器人领域发布了一份新的技术发展报告。,Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any weirder along comes a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot sector.
5313,是的。,Yep.
5314,现在性爱机器人可是件大事。,Sex robots are a big deal right now.
5315,最近，责任机器人基金会 (FRR) 发布了一份报告，展望了性爱机器人在接下来的五到十年中的发展。,"Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years."
5316,据谢菲尔德大学机器人技术和人工智能荣誉退休教授兼 FRR 联合创始人诺埃尔?夏基称，我们需要开始认真对待性爱机器人的兴起了。,"According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously."
5317,顾客可以选择机器人的眼睛颜色、乳头形状和指甲类型。,"Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, nipple shape and fingernail type."
5318,夏基在新报告发布时说道：“人们在背后讥笑，但各大公司确实推出了很多性爱机器人，而我们也会看到更多。”,"""People snigger about them, but the companies are actually shipping quite a lot and we are going to see them a lot more,"" Mr Sharkey said at the launch of the new report."
5319,现代性爱娃娃已经从充气娃娃进化成了机器人，它们拥有硅胶皮肤，摸起来很温暖，还特意利用人工智能设置了人类般的性反应。,Modern sex dolls have evolved out of their blow-up counterparts into robots with a silicon skin that is warm to the touch - with deliberately human-like responses achieved by artificial intelligence.
5320,用户也可以“自定义”他们的机器人来满足自己的喜好，从眼睛颜色、乳头形状到指甲类型或颜色都可以选择。,"The user can also ""customise"" their robot to suit their persuasions, choosing everything from the robot's eye colour, nipple shape to fingernail type or colour."
5321,但是更令人不安的是，很多拥有“个性”的机器人会让“复制娇妻”看起来很先进。,"But it gets even more disturbing, with many of the robots possessing ""personalities"" that would make a Stepford Wife look progressive."
5322,现代性爱玩具已进化成拥有硅胶皮肤的机器人。,Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicon skin.
5323,比如，RealBotix 机器人就能够根据使用者认为有吸引力的特点来自定义，比如害羞。,"The RealBotix robot, for example, allows users to customise their robots according to the traits they find appealing, such as shyness."
5324,还有由 True Companion 公司开发的 Roxxxy Gold 性爱机器人，可预先设定性格特点，包括略带羞涩的“冷艳法拉”和“乐于冒险”的“狂野温蒂”。,"Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, including ""Frigid Farrah"" that gives the impression of shyness and ""Wild Wendy"" with an ""adventurous"" personality."
5325,“Roxxxy Gold 机器人拥有尽可能与你相称的个性，”True Companion 公司网站对此津津乐道。,"""Roxxxy Gold has a personality which is matched as much as possible to your personality,"" the True Companion website enthuses."
5326,所以她爱你所爱，恶你所恶。,"So she likes what you like, dislikes what you dislike, etc."
5327,她也和正常人一样在那几天有小情绪！,She also has moods during the day just like real people!
5328,她可以慵懒，可以健谈，也可以‘性致勃勃’！”,"She can be sleepy, conversational or she can 'be in the mood'!"""
5329,性爱机器人的兴起带来很多不安——不仅仅是取代了真实的人类关系——而且卑躬屈膝的女性特征以及在冷艳（解读为：抗拒）法拉身上抽动的强奸暗示是最令人担忧的。,"There are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots - not least of which is the replacement of real, human relationships - but the subservient female traits, the rapey connotations of making a move on Frigid (read: resistant) Farrah, are the most concerning."
5330,True Companion 在其网站上将 Roxxxy 比作男人的震动棒。,"On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men."
5331,该网站称“如果女人有震动棒，那为什么男人不可以有 Roxxxy？”,"""If woman (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?"" the website states."
5332,然而这些性爱机器人并不是一个单纯的恋物，也不只是一种性爱玩具。,"However, these sex robots are not a mere fetish or just another sex toy."
5333,他们的出现和日益成熟直指我们的文化中更黑暗、更深层的部分：从完美的性别平等逃离，走向以臣服为附加选项的性爱。,"Their emergence and increasing sophistication points to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional add-on."
5334,当然大部分男性不会留有性爱机器人，而且虽然 FRR 指出性爱机器人正越来越受欢迎，但它们目前依然处在消费文化的边缘。,"Most men, naturally, are not going to keep sex robots, and while the FRR noted their increasing popularity, they remain, for now, on the outskirts of consumer culture."
5335,但是从边缘渗透而来的东西能让我们看清我们所处的这个时代的进程。,But what seeps in from the fringes can be highly instructive as to the tenor of the era we're living in.
5336,很多人本不诡异也不具备攻击性，直到自由市场让他们有机会变得如此。,And many people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them the permission to be so.
5337,这些精细的性爱机器人出现在一个全球女性的权利受到威胁的时代，白宫还有一位总统吹嘘对女性的性暴力，这并不是巧合。,"There is little coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women's rights are under threat across the globe, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women."
5338,电视剧《使女的故事》最让人胆寒的部分不在于逼真的画面，不在于那一具具悬挂的尸体，也不在于那一双双被挖出的眼睛，而在于那过分真实的想象。,"The most chilling aspect of the TV series The Handmaid's Tale isn't the graphic imagery, the noosed bodies and gouged eyes, but just how realistic that vision feels."
5339,基列共和国是一次跳跃，但现在看起来这并不遥远。,"The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but, right now, it doesn't feel like a large one."
5340,这些性爱机器人背后的目标就是要尽技术可能创造最类似真实女性的身体（虽然是按色情明星的比例）。,The aim behind these sex robots is to create as much of a physical likeness to actual women (albeit with porn star proportions) as technologically possible.
5341,这些机器人的创造者想要她们拥有人类的触觉，并模仿真实的人体动作。,"Their creators want them to feel human to the touch, for them to mimic the movement of a real body."
5342,但直白地讲，她们的“个性”并不能代表真实的女性。,"But, pointedly, when it comes to their ""personalities"" the robots do not represent real women."
5343,她们不能分手，也不能出走。,"They cannot break up with their companion, or walk out."
5344,她们没有求助机构也没有后续故事，完全没有任何独立，也没有任何可能打破彻底的奴役幻想。,"They have no agency or back-story, nothing to suggest independence or anything that may disrupt the fantasy of total servitude."
5345,换言之，她们是情趣奴隶。,"They are pleasant slaves, in other words."
5346,或者按 2017 年的通俗说法：使女。,Or to put it into 2017 parlance: handmaidens.
5347,《长城》讲述了在古代，一支中国精英部队为保卫人类，在举世闻名的长城上与怪兽饕餮进行生死决战的故事。,“The Great Wall” tells the story of a Chinese elite troop in ancient times that battled valiantly against the monster Taotie on the world renowned Great Wall of China.
5348,《奔跑吧兄弟》第四季最后一期已经录制，“跑男团”队长的邓超5月30日接受了沈阳晚报、沈阳网记者的微信采访，从“跑男”中的“学霸”到《恶棍天使》中的“搞笑恶棍”，再到“颓废男”陈默，邓超给观众的印象像是“百变星君”，不断变化。,"The last episode of “Hurry Up, Brother” Season 4 has been recorded. Deng Chao, leader of the “Running Man Team” was interviewed via WeChat by the reporters of Shenyang Evening News and syd.com on May 30. From “Super Scholar” in “Running Man” to “Funny Villain” in “Devil and Angel” to “Decadent Guy” Chen Mo, the impression Deng Chao gives to the audience is that of a “flexible transformer”, constantly changing."
5349,邓超表示，“在表演上，同样的事情我不会做的，要不断更新。”,"Deng Chao said, “I won’t do the same thing over and over again in my acting career. I want to renew myself constantly.”"
5350,特朗普的伟大功绩？,Trump's great feat?
5351,让米特?罗姆尼 (Mitt Romney) 成为常识的缩影,Making Mitt Romney seem the epitome of common sense
5352,政治分歧带来美国选民的两极分化，而从微观角度来看，则破坏了美国家庭和睦。这对特朗普时代来说已经是见怪不怪了。,"It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarised the US electorate have, on a micro-scale, torn families apart."
5353,在圣诞节和感恩节前后，美国的各大报纸在评论专栏中充斥着如何应对票选特朗普亲属的恐惧。,"Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the US abounded with advice columns on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives."
5354,通常认为，我们正在竭尽全力刺破我们的“过滤泡沫”。,We are all supposedly straining to burst our filter bubbles.
5355,更少地发表意见的是特朗普将家人凝聚一起的力量。,Less remarked on is the power of Trump to bring families together.
5356,我提到这一点是因为我的堂姐，一位居住在芝加哥的左翼诗人，他与我们家中的共和党人长期不和，这一周他要来纽约拜访我。,"I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and who's long been at loggerheads with Republicans in our family, has been visiting me in New York this week."
5357,她提醒我，团结起来对抗共同的敌人可以产生强有力的效果。,She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
5358,由于和特朗普在白宫共事，她认识的所有人，甚至包括几十年来一直发生政治争吵的共和党人亲戚，现在突然而且奇怪地都站在同一条战线了。,"With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican sibling she had been bickering with about politics for decades, is suddenly and peculiarly on the same side."
5359,如果都在餐桌的话，这当然是一件好事。但是让我感到震惊的是，从更广泛的角度来看，这会引起重大的风险。,"Around the dinner table this is surely a good thing; but it strikes me that, in a broader context, it carries significant risks."
5360,虽然左派人物一直以来受到特朗普的怂恿，但是他担任总统带来的翘曲效应则推动我们全部向右转。,"The left has been invigorated by Trump, but the warping effect of his presidency has the power to push us all rightwards."
5361,当我们谈论“正常化”和特朗普时，我们所指的是担忧的可能性，即他的古怪行为某天可能会停止。,"When we talk about ""normalisation"" and Trump, we are referring to the scary possibility that his antics may one day cease to appal."
5362,然而，还有一个更加令人担忧的长期场景，特朗普要“正常化”的是与右翼共和党人的关系，这些共和党人之前曾反对总统先生的标准，现在则突然间看起来成了理性的象征。,"There is an even scarier long-range scenario, however, in which what Trump ""normalises"" are rightwing Republicans who, held up against his standards, suddenly seem the epitome of reasonable."
5363,我发现最近自己对米特?罗姆尼版的癫狂古怪有些怀念：把狗在汽车上，14％ 的所得税（但至少我们知道他的纳税申报表），为与特朗普相比，这两个举动的罪行似乎确实太轻微了。,"I find myself actively nostalgic these days for Mitt Romney's quaint version of crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, seem very mild offences indeed."
5364,特朗普时代过去后，下一任共和党候选人只需要理智地取得进行不可估量的改善的资格。,"When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate will merely have to be sane to qualify as an immeasurable improvement."
5365,当我的堂姐住在镇上时，我们带着孩子去了纽约公园的旋转木马，这是由纽约中央公园管理部门经营的最大的旋转木马，如果你不需要咖啡的话，这三美元门票是你在这个城市最具消费价值的。,"While my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels run by the New York parks department, and the best three bucks you can spend in the city if you don't require caffeine."
5366,木马的声音如雷鸣般巨大，中央圆柱上为玻璃纤维设计，所有的小丑和动物扭过头，恐怖地和险恶看着自己的肩膀，而叮当作响的音乐则奇怪地响着。,"The horses are thunderously huge, the fibre-glass designs on the central cylinder - all gurning clowns and animals twisting to look over their own shoulders in terror - utterly sinister, and the tinkling music oddly transporting."
5367,太多庸俗的城市令人失望：从高楼大厦俯瞰的景观变得老套，天际线变得过于熟悉已经不能提供太多的刺激，而城市的现实并没有支撑起梦想。,"So many of the cliches of a city disappoint: views from tall buildings get old, skylines grow too familiar to offer much of a thrill, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream."
5368,35 年后，我还没有完全忘记那天，我发现此“瑞士小屋”其实并不是瑞士小屋，而是一个位于主题酒吧“古老的瑞士小屋” (Ye Olde Swiss Cottage)，我记不清了，但在伦敦北部的一个交叉路口附近。,"Thirty-five years later and I'm still not entirely over the day I discovered Swiss Cottage is not, in fact, a Swiss cottage - the theme pub, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, doesn't count - but a large roundabout in north London."
5369,然而，中央公园的旋转木马仍然是一个魔幻般的体验，对于两个 2 岁的孩子，一个11岁的孩子，和四个 40 来岁的两个女孩都可以参加的活动来说，每个人都玩得很开心。,"The Central Park carousel, however, is still a weirdly magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time."
5370,如果我能评价旋转木马，我会给它满分，但幸好没有人问到。,"If I could have rated the carousel I would have given it full marks, but thankfully nobody asked."
5371,但本周在一家百货公司，在刷信用卡之前，我被要求对我的交易“体验”进行一到五星的评分。,"In a department store this week, on the other hand, I was required, before swiping my credit card, to rate my transactional ""experience"" on a scale of one to five stars."
5372,在我街道角落的咖啡店里，也是如此，此外可以选择用 15％ 小费进行评分，这是为了在柜台上买东西。,"In the coffee shop at the corner of my street it's the same thing, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this for buying something over the counter."
5373,这样做的效果不仅在于减缓了本应该是中性交易的速度，而且给服务员带来压力，将个人因素加入到了不需要的情景。,"The effect of this is not only to slow down what should be a neutral exchange, but to put pressure on the server to inject personality into a situation where none is required."
5374,这位百货商店里可怜的女人抱歉地笑着，而我则疲惫不堪，信用卡交易体验给她评了五星。,"The poor woman in the department store stood grinning apologetically while, wearily, I gave the experience of handing her my credit card five stars."
5375,奥斯卡·皮斯托利斯因胸痛从监狱转入医院,Oscar Pistorius taken from jail to hospital with chest pains

5380,皮斯托利斯声称将女友误认为夜间躲在隔间的闯入者。,Pistorius claimed he mistook his girlfriend for a nighttime intruder hiding in the cubicle.
5381,检察官已宣布他们有意再次上诉，此次是为针对皮斯托利斯的六年徒刑，他们认为该刑期太过仁慈。,"Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient."
5382,国家检察署表示将向南非最高法院提起上诉，且此上诉可在今年审理。,"The National Prosecuting Authority said it will appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court, and the appeal could be heard this year."
5383,如果检察官获胜，皮斯托利斯将面临增至 15 年的刑期。,Pistorius faces having his sentence increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.

5395,5月18日财政部公布《工业企业结构调整专项奖补资金管理办法》，将安排专项奖补资金推动化解煤炭、钢铁行业的产能过剩，总金额为1000亿元。,"On May 18, the Ministry of Finance issued the “Administrative Measures for Special Rewards and Subsidies for the Structural Adjustments of Industrial Enterprises”, and will arrange special rewards and subsidies amounting to a total of RMB100 billion to help advance reduction of overcapacity in the coal and steel industries."
5396,近期上海、山西、山东、江苏、黑龙江等多个地方政府陆续提出了关于化解过剩产能的改革意见。,"Recently, many local governments including that of Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang have proposed reform opinions on reducing overcapacity."
5397,其中，不少省份甚至提出，要积极争取中央财政对其省份的去产能财政支持。,"In particular, many provinces have even proposed to actively lobby the Central Government for fiscal support to reduce overcapacity in their respective provinces."
5398,一个佐证是，仅8个省份公布的煤炭去产能目标就站到全国煤炭减产计划的90%。,One proof is that the overcapacity reduction target for coal announced by a mere eight provinces already account for 90% of the coal overcapacity reduction plan nationwide.
5399,厦门大学中国能源政策研究院院长林伯强在接受记者采访时认为，钢铁和煤炭行业的“去产能”仅依靠中央的1000亿元远远不够，更多的资金需要地方政府和企业来自行解决。怎么解决？,"At an interview with reporters, Lin Boqiang, Dean of China Institute for Studies in Energy Policy at Xiamen University, believed that merely relying on the Central government’s RMB100 billion to “reduce overcapacity” in the steel and coal industries is far from sufficient. More funds should come from local governments and enterprises. How should that be done?"
5400,山西省近期公布的煤炭去产能实施细则中提出将山西焦煤集团改组为国有资本投资公司，对企业的资产和业务进行重组整合，构建全新的商业模式。,"In the detailed implementation rules for reducing surplus coal capacity issued recently by Shanxi Province, it was proposed that Shanxi Coking Coal Group should be restructured and transformed into a state-owned capital investment company, its assets and businesses should be reorganized and consolidated, and a new business model constructed."
5401,资金实际缺口可能3倍于补贴此前，人力资源和社会保障部部长尹蔚民表示，初步统计“去产能”要分流安置的员工煤炭系统是130万人，钢铁系统是50万人。,"The actual funding gap could be 3 times that of the subsidy. Earlier, Yin Weimin, Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, said that initial calculations showed that a total of 1.3 million employees in the coal industry and 500,000 in the steel industry were required to be resettled as a result of “reducing overcapacity”."
5402,南方日报讯（记者/谢庆裕）记者今日从省环保厅获悉，2012年广东省重点污染源环境保护信用评级结果正在进行公示。,Nanfang Daily news (Reporter/Xie Qingyu) The reporter learned from the provincial environmental protection office today that the 2012 results of the environmental protection credit rating of key sources of pollution are being published.
5403,经过评定，1251家列入环保信用管理名单企业中有134家因为停产、未验收、关停等原因暂不予评级。,"Ratings showed that of the 1,251 enterprises listed on the environmental protection credit management register, 134 were not rated temporarily because of production stoppage, not having been checked and accepted, having been shut down, and/or other reasons."
5404,而在拟评红牌企业中，主要以电镀、印染、防治等重污染企业较多，一些污水处理厂也榜上有名。,"Of the enterprises that would be rated with a red card, heavy polluters such as those involved in electroplating, printing and dyeing, and prevention and control dominate. A number of waste water treatment plants were also listed."

5666,廋肉、奶制品和巧克力是否有助于缓解炎症性肠病 (IBD) ？,"Red meat, dairy, and chocolate could help relieve IBD"
5667,廋肉和巧克力可能听起来像是你消化系统的梦魇。,Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
5668,但是一项新的研究结果显示恰恰相反：富含肉类蛋白和乳制品的饮食可以帮助缓解炎症性肠病患者的相关症状。,But a new study claims quite the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy treats could help relieve symptoms of sufferers of inflammatory bowel disease.
5669,该种不治之症为约 130 万名美国人和约30万英国人带来生活影响，导致胃痉挛和腹胀、经常性或出血性腹泻、体重减轻和极度疲倦等。,"The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness."
5670,华盛顿大学的研究人员通常会建议患者避免进食肉类和奶制品以缓解症状，但研究人员发现蛋白质的关键氨基酸-色氨酸有助于促进免疫细胞生长，而这些细胞可增进肠道的耐受力。,"While sufferers are usually advised to dodge meat and dairy to soothe their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found protein's essential amino acid tryptophan helps develop immune cells that foster a tolerant gut."
5671,首席研究员马尔科?科隆纳 (Marco Colonna) 博士解释说，免疫细胞会在肠道中进行巡逻，确保隐藏在食物中的有害微生物不会悄悄进入体内。,Lead investigator Dr Marco Colonna explained immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food don't sneak into the body.
5672,引发炎症的细胞与增进耐受性的细胞之间保持均衡，保护身体而不损伤各类敏感脆弱的组织。,"Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues."
5673,当均衡状态过于偏向炎症时，就可能会发生炎症性肠病。,"When the balance tilts too far toward inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result."
5674,在实验中发现一种促进免疫力的细胞出现在携带特殊细菌的小白鼠中。,In experiments it was found a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell appears in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their guts.
5675,细菌需要色氨酸（蛋白质的构成部分之一）来形成细胞的外观。,And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cells' appearance.
5676,科隆纳教授说：“我们在一种细菌种群 (罗伊氏乳杆菌，这是肠道微生物群的正常部分) 和可促进耐受力的细胞种群发展之间建立了联系。,"Professor Colonna said: 'We established a link between one bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."
5677,小白鼠在饮食中摄入的色氨酸越多，它们的免疫细胞就越多。,"The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.'"
5678,他建议，如果人类使用相同的方法，即路氏乳酸杆菌和富含色氨酸的饮食相结合可能会形成一个更具耐受力，更少发炎性的肠道环境。,"He suggested if the same works in humans, a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet may foster a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment."
5679,博士后研究员路易莎?塞万提斯?巴拉甘 (Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas) 研究了一种可增进耐受力的免疫细胞，当她发现一组研究小鼠有这样的细胞，但是另一组同样的菌株分开饲养时没有。,Postdoctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studying a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of study mice had such cells but another group of the same strain but housed separately did not.
5680,她怀疑这种差异与小白鼠的肠道微生物 (指通常生活在胃肠道内的细菌，病毒和真菌) 群落有关。,"She suspected the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live within the gastrointestinal tract."
5681,对小白鼠的胆固醇进行 DNA 测序，发现有 6 种细菌种群存在于具有免疫细胞的小鼠体内，但没有免疫细胞的小白鼠体内则没有。,The guts of the mice were DNA sequenced and it was found six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells but absent from the mice without them.
5682,小白鼠在无菌环境中饲养，因此它们缺乏肠道微生物，并且不能出现这种免疫细胞，存在路氏乳杆菌则产生免疫细胞。,Mice reared in a sterile environment so they lacked a gut microbiome and do not develop this kind of immune cell were given L. reuteri and the immune cells arose.
5683,为了理解细菌如何影响免疫系统，研究人员在液体中培养路氏乳杆菌，然后将无细菌的少量液体转移到从小白鼠分离出的未成熟免疫细胞中。,"To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice."
5684,该免疫细胞发育成为具有耐受力的细胞。,The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
5685,当从液体中纯化出活性成分时，可以证明该活性成分是色氨酸代谢的副产物，称为吲哚-3-乳酸。,"When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid."
5686,当研究人员将小白鼠饲料中的色氨酸数量翻倍后，这类细胞的数量增加了大约 50％，但当色氨酸水平减半时，细胞数量减少了一半。,"When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half."
5687,塞万提斯?巴拉甘 (Cervantes-Barragan) 博士解释说，人们和老鼠一样，具有相同的增进耐受力的细胞，我们大多数人在我们的胃肠道中存在着路氏乳杆菌。,"Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and most of us shelter L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts."
5688,人类是否可以像实验中的小白鼠一样将体内来自路氏乳杆菌的色氨酸副产物诱导细胞发育，目前尚未可知，但在炎症性肠病患者中发现与色氨酸有关的基因缺陷。,"It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri induce the cells to develop in people as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."
5689,她说：“这些细胞的发育可能正是我们想要得到的结果，因为这些细胞可以控制肠道内表面的炎症反应。,She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
5690,可以不确切地说，在路氏乳杆菌中存在的高水平色氨酸可能会导致该菌种数量的增加。,"Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may induce expansion of this population.'"
5691,何塞·穆里尼奥认为曼联签下了“天才”内马尼亚·马蒂奇,Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United have signed a 'genius' in Nemanja Matic
5692,周三晚，内马尼亚·马蒂奇在桑普多利亚对抗赛首次亮相后，穆里尼奥认定曼联签下了一位“天才”中场球员。,"Manchester United have signed a ""genius"" in Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening."
5693,马蒂奇来自切尔西，签约金高达 4000 万英镑，周二在都柏林对阵皇家马德里的欧洲超级杯之前的联赛最后一场季前赛中开打 2-1，赢得了保罗·博格巴和安德烈亚斯·佩雷拉的青睐。,"The £40m signing from Chelsea started the 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final preseason game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marauded forward at will."
5694,然而，在布鲁斯季前赛亚洲巡回赛中，马蒂奇比赛状态严重不足，只完成了 45 分钟的时间，穆里尼奥承认在英超赛季开始前需要改进。,"However, having been left out of the Blues' preseason tour of Asia, Matic was severely lacking match fitness and only managed 45 minutes, something Mourinho admitted needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season."
5695,“他需要时间，但他有经验、智慧以及天才的思考方式——他思考足球，”穆里尼奥说。,"""He needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football,"" Mourinho said."
5696,“我们会尽快帮助他做好准备。”,"""We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."""
5697,穆里尼奥在本赛季开始时开始安排他的首发阵容。与马蒂奇一样，新签约球员维克多·林德洛夫和罗梅卢·卢卡库也开始了在英杰华体育场的比赛。,"As well as Matic, fellow new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho started to shape his starting XI for the start of the season."
5698,独立报本周报道，穆里尼奥仍然希望再引进三位签约球员，但他坚持认为俱乐部“工作出色”，他心中有四位首选签约球员，俱乐部已经引进了其中三位。,"The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted another three signings but he insisted that the club had already done a ""fantastic job"" of delivering three of his four priority signings."
5699,“俱乐部引进了其中三位签约球员，我十分感谢。”他补充说道。,"""To get three out of four I thank the club for that,"" he added."
5700,“如果俱乐部能够引进全部四位球员，我会更开心，但他们已经为我做出了很大的努力。”,"""I will be happier if they get me four of four but they did a great effort for me."""
5701,全球在掀护卫舰高潮 中国如果不建这型军舰是否会落后？,"The global spree of frigates building If China does not build this type of warships, will it fall behind?"
5702,随着近期世界各大海军强国先后公布了新型护卫舰的建造计划，仿佛一夜之间护卫舰有成了各大强国海军关注的焦点，先是日本在2018年度防卫预算中确定采购两艘新型护卫舰，使得日本DEX护卫舰计划终于有了实质性的突破，后是美国洛克希德马丁于近期公布了美国FFG护卫舰计划的最新方案，那么中国的新型护卫舰该何去何从呢？,"With the recent announcement of the construction of new types of frigates by major naval powers in the world, it seems that frigates have become the focus of attention of the major naval powers overnight. First, Japan has decided to purchase two new frigates in the 2018 annual defense budget, finally making a substantial breakthrough for its DEX frigates program. Later, Lockheed Martin of USA recently published the latest arrangement for the United States FFG frigates program. How about China's plan for building new type of frigates?"
5703,随着2017年末一艘最新的054A型护卫舰的下水，标志着054A护卫舰已经建造了高达29艘之多，已经逼近了053H系列护卫舰的总和，而从2006年第一艘054A下水至今，054A的建造历程已经有了12年之久，即使在全世界范围内，建造如此数量之多的高性能通用护卫舰，除了中国，也只有美国在上个世纪7、80年代建造的“佩里”级护卫舰可以相提并论了。,"With the launching of the latest model of 054A frigate at the end of 2017, the number of 054A frigate has reached 29, approaching the sum of the 053H series frigates. Since the first 054A was launched in 2006, the history of building 054A has extended to 12 years. Building such a large number of high-performance general purpose frigates is very rare in the history. Apart from China, the only comparable accomplishment was made by the United States in the 1970s and 1980s when it built a host of 'Perry' class frigates."
5704,而为何要建造这么多054A的原因也很简单，那就是实惠、好用、外加补充多年来的海军欠账。,"And the reason why it is necessary to build so many 054A frigates is simple, that is, it is affordable, easy to operate, and doing so can make up for the deficiency of Chinese Navel that has beset the Naval for many years."
5705,054A护卫舰凭借较高的性价比和不错的战斗力多年以来一直得到中国海军的青睐，其4000吨左右的排水量，搭载有一门76毫米主炮，32单元海红旗-16和鱼-8反潜导弹共架发射的垂发系统，8枚鹰击83和一架直-9直升机，虽然是2006年开始建造，设计时间更是很早的一种舰艇，但是其战斗力即使放到当今也不算太差，放眼全世界的护卫舰当中也能达到中上的水平。,"The 054A frigate has been favored by the Chinese Navy for many years thanks to its high cost performance and good combat effectiveness. With a displacement of 4,000 tons, the warship is equipped with a 76-mm main gun, and shared launching system for 32 HQ-16 and Fish-8 anti-submarine missiles, 8 YJ-83 anti-ship missiles and 1 Z-9 helicopter. Although it was first built in 2006 and was designed even earlier, its combat effectiveness is not too bad even by today's standard. It can be ranked as medium- to high level frigate among all the frigates in the world."
5706,但是这毕竟是一型21世纪初设计的舰艇，武器配置放在一边，其动力系统和电子雷达设备与目前世界主流护卫舰相比已经存在很大差距，像欧洲的同类型护卫舰已经配备全电力推进、小型多功能相控阵雷达、大尺寸直升机甲板的情况下，也到了发展新型号的时候了。,"However, it is a warship designed at the beginning of the 21st century after all. Armaments aside, its propulsion system and electronic radar system lag significantly behind the current mainstream frigates in the world. Considering that similar frigates in Europe have been equipped with full electric propulsion, small multi-function phased array radars and large helicopter decks, it is time to develop new models."
5707,那么说中国的新型护卫舰应该如何发展，这与其将来的定位和我们中国海军的战略方针有着直接关系。,Then how should China develop its new frigates? This has a direct bearing on its future orientation and the strategic direction of Chinese navy.
5708,中国海军未来的发展必将是彻底成为蓝水海军的，而未来也必将是走向大洋，具备在于中国切身利益息息相关的地区进行快速部署，展示武力存在，必要时能够拥有强大的战斗力来保证中国在该地区的切身利益不被损坏，那么如此看来新型胡伟江必将朝着大型化、远洋化发展。,"The future development of the Chinese Navy will inevitably aim at becoming the blue water navy, roaming in the vastness of the oceans. It should be able to deploy rapidly in areas that are closely related to China’s vital interests and demonstrate the presence of force. If necessary, it will use powerful combat capabilities to ensure that China’s vital interests in the region are not compromised. So, it seems that the new models of frigates will surely be huge ships that can roam the blue water."
5709,再看看新型护卫舰在未来中国海军序列里的定位问题，未来的中国海军应该会和美国海军类似，除去必备的近海防御舰艇以外，其他主力舰艇将会根据情况需要组成航母战斗群或者两栖攻击舰打击群。,"Let's look at the positioning of the new frigates in the future rank and file of Chinese Navy. The future Chinese Navy should be similar to the US Navy. In addition to the necessary offshore defense ships, the other main ships will form an aircraft carrier battle group or amphibious attack group as the situation requires."
5710,而新型护卫舰的角色在未来航母战斗群里应该会充当反潜主力和中近区域放空的定位，在两栖攻击舰打击群里应该会充当护卫舰艇类，那么根据这样的需求就要求新型护卫舰必须具备强大的反潜能力和不错的中程区域放空能力。,"The new frigates in the future aircraft carrier battle group should play the primary role in anti-submarine and short-range air defense operations. In the amphibious attack group, they should provide protection to ships. According to these requirements, the new frigates must have strong anti-submarine capability and good mid-range air defense capability."
5711,基于上述的定位，可以大胆的设想出未来国产护卫舰的大概模样。,"Based on the above positioning, we can boldly imagine the rough appearance of the new frigates in the future."
5712,首先来说排水量相对于现在的054A型护卫舰将有一个大幅度的增加，估计新型护卫舰的排水量会达到5000-6000吨左右;动力系统将会采用有一台QC280改进型燃气轮机和两台柴油机组成的综合电力推进系统，最高航速有望达到30节左右，续航力也会大幅度增加;至于武器配置76毫米主炮和1130近防炮应该会保留，但是会增加一座红旗10发射系统，主炮后面应该会有一个32-48单元红旗16改进型和鱼-8共架的垂发系统，在舰体中后方应该会加装一个8-16单元的大型垂发系统用于发射鹰击18和新型巡航导弹;机库和停机平台也会增大，达到两架10吨级直升机的停放和存放;至于电子雷达系统方面，高配的话应该会装备基于346A发展的小型四面固定相控阵雷达，低配的话可以使用类似于欧洲护卫舰上的多功能旋转相控阵雷达。,"First, the displacement will be increased significantly compared to the current 054A model. It is estimated that the displacement of the new frigate will reach about 5000-6000 tons. The ship will be equipped with a comprehensive electric propulsion system that combines a QC280 modified gas turbine and two diesel engines, improving the maximum speed to around 30 knots and significantly increase the cruise range. As for the weaponry, the 76mm main gun and 1130 near-range anti-aircraft gun will be retained, but a HQ-10 launch system will be added. A shared vertical launching system for 32-48 unit HQ-16 modified missile and Fish-8 missiles will be furnished at the back of the main gun. A large 8-16-unit vertical launching system should be furnished at the middle-to-rear section of the hull for the launch of YJ-18 and new cruise missiles. Hangars and parking platforms will also be expanded for the parking and storage of two 10-ton helicopters. As for the electronic radar systems, the high grade model will be equipped with a small four-sided fixed phase-control array radar developed based on 346A. the low grade model will be furnished with multi-function rotating phased array radar similar to the ones on European frigates."
5713,这样一来新型护卫舰的总体水平将会达到目前世界上的一流水准，即使是同美国的FFG相比也不逞多让。,"Thus, the overall level of the new frigates will edge into the world's top bracket, even comparable to the FFG frigates of the USA."
5714,当然上述的概念只是笔者对于国产新型护卫舰的猜想，具体如何我们只能等到新型护卫舰下水的时候才能一探究竟，让我们共同期待吧。,"Of course, these are only the author's conjecture on domestically produced new frigates. Only when the new frigates are launched into the water can we know the truth. Let's anticipate the day."

5717,近年来，我市鼓励企业积极参与国家、行业标准和区域团体标准的建设，对为主或者参与制定浙江制造团体标准的企业给予30万元奖励，对通过浙江制造品牌认证的企业奖励50万元，是全省该项奖励的最高额度，激发了企业参与对标的热情。,"In recent years, our city has encouraged enterprises to actively participate in the construction of national or industry standards as well as regional group standards. An award of RMB300,000 will be given to enterprises that are principals or that participate in formulating standards for the Made in Zhejiang team, and RMB500,000 awarded to enterprises that have passed the Made in Zhejiang brand certification. This is the most generous award given out in the Province, and has incentivized enterprises to benchmark themselves against the standards."
5718,日前，王力集团生产车间，该集团体系负责人高健与员工一起正将一樘防盗安全门封箱打包，作为参与浙江制造团体标准对标达标工作样品，准备送往绍兴质量检测中心。,"Recently, at the production workshop of Wonly Group, Gao Jian, head of the Group’s companies, and its staff were working together to pack and send a burglar-proof door to Shaoxing Quality Inspection Center as a sample for the Made in Zhejiang team’s benchmarking and standard achievement work."
5719,就在前两天，王力已通过了“浙江制造”认证专家组的现场审核。,"Just a couple of days ago, Wonly had passed the on-site inspection of the “Made in Zhejiang” certification expert team."
5720,高健表示，由行业技术专家和质量认证组织组成的专业团队对该集团在品质卓越、自主创新等核心方面的成绩表示赞誉，一致认为完全合标，接下来只要产品通过检验，王力将成为首批通过该标准的企业之一。,"Gao Jian said that the professional team made up of industry technical experts and the quality certification organization commended the Group’s performance in terms of quality excellence, proprietary innovation and other core aspects, and unanimously believed that the Group had achieved the standards in all respects. If Wonly’s product were to pass the subsequent inspection, it will become one of the first enterprises to have achieved and passed these standards."
5721,王力集团只是标准撬动产业转型升级的一个缩影。,Wonly Group is but an epitome of standards driving industry toward structural transformation.
5722,我市与其同步开展浙江制造团体标准对标和达标工作的还有步阳、群升集团。,Buyang Group and Qunsheng Group are also enterprises in the city that are carrying out the Made in Zhejiang team’s benchmarking and and standard achievement work.
5723,自去年由我市防盗安全门行业制定的浙江制造团队标准制定以来，星月、新多等企业也在积极申请对接对标工作。,"Since our City formulated the Made in Zhejiang standards for the burglar-proof doors industry last year, Xinyue, Simto and other enterprises have also actively applied to undergo benchmarking."
5724,近些年大量资本涌入影视市场，明星演员的知名度与片酬水涨船高。制片人何静曾爆料称，某部热拍剧中的两位演员拿着近亿元的片酬，最后竟然只一起搭了两天的戏，其他戏份基本全由替身代劳。,"In recent years, a flood of capital has flowed into the film and TV market, and the profile and remuneration of actors have risen rapidly. Producer He Jing once revealed that two actors of a certain hit drama which was being filmed were earning salaries of close to RMB100 million. In the end, they only acted for two days; their doubles took care of the rest of the film."
5725,在演员四处串戏成风的当下，同一时间女男主演在不同剧组，造成同一时间不能同时出现在片场，剧组被迫用替身来保证周期。,"In the present situation where actors taking on roles in several dramas simultaneously is popular, lead actors and actresses would be at different sets at the same time. This has meant that they would not be able to appear at the same set at the same time. As such, film crews have been forced to use doubles to ensure the film schedule."
5726,据了解，在从成都客场回到北京后，莫里斯继续前往医院进行了针灸治疗，以保证伤情不会继续恶化。,"It is learned that Morris will head for hospital to accept acupunture therapy after arriving at Beijing from Chengdu, so as to prevent the injury from continuous deterioration."
5727,三星在本周早些时候发布的一份声明中说，在美国市场，93%的已售Note7智能手机已被召回。,"In a statement released earlier this week, Samsung stated that 93% of the Note 7 smartphones in the US have been recalled."
5728,最后，李彦宏还称，中国不缺好故事，但没有像哈利波特那样“能跨越文化，具备生态效应的IP”，而这种“生态思维”正是我们该向好莱坞学习的地方。,"Finally, Li Yanhong also said that China does not lack good stories, but does not have “IPs with ecological effect that can transcend cultures” like Harry Porter, and this “ecological thinking” is precisely an area we should learn from Hollywood."
5729,中国家庭债务率接近美国 比买不起房更可怕的是还不起债？,China's household debt ratio is close to the United States. Is being unable to repay loan more frightening than being unable to afford a home?
5730,最近一段时间，大家都在讨论房地产政策最近有什么变化，是不是房地产政策又要松绑了？土地政策供给主体多元化，会不会让房价出现下降呢？,"Recently, everyone has been talking about the recent changes in real estate policies. Is it true that real estate policies have been loosened? Is the diversification of land supply going to bring down the housing prices?"
5731,但是，在我们担心房地产价格，担心宏观经济调控，担心房地产市场未来走势的时候，《人民日报》再次撰文了，上次我们专门论述了《人民日报》评论对于房地产调控的定调，而现在《人民日报》撰文论述的却是一个比买不买得起房更为严重的话题，这就是即使你买得起房，还得起债吗？,"However, just when we were worried about real estate prices, macroeconomic controls and the future trend of the real estate market, the People's Daily published an important commentary once again. Last time we discussed how People’s Daily had set the tone for the regulation of real estate market through a commentary. This time, the commentary of People's Daily deals with a topic that is more serious than the affordability of housing: can you repay the loan even if you can afford the down payment of a mortgage?"
5732,今天，我们就来聊聊比买房更为严峻的问题：还贷。,"Today, let's discuss the question more serious than buying a house: repay the loan."
5733,一、中国日益严重的房债危机,I. China's growing housing debt crisis
5734,《人民日报》海外版于1月17日发表了评论文章《奖与贷︰奋斗青年的乐与忧》，根据文中的数据显示，2017年11月，中国社科院国家金融与发展实验室、国家资产负债表研究中心发布的《三季度中国去杠杆进程报告》指出，居民部门杠杆率依然延续上升趋势，从2017年二季度的47.4%上升到三季度的48.6%，上升了1.3个百分点，2017年前三个季度上升了3.8个百分点。,"The People's Daily Overseas Edition published a commentary titled “Awards and Loans: The Joy and Worries of Struggling Young People” on January 17th. The article cited some data from an report on the progress of nationwide financial deleveraging in the 3rth quarter jointly published by the National Laboratory of Finance and Development of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the National Balance Sheet Research Center in November 2017. According to the report, the leverage ratio of the residents' sector continues to climb, rising from 47.4% in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6% in the third quarter, an increase of 1.3%, which amounts to an increase of 3.8% in the first three quarters of 2017."
5735,居民部门在全部实体经济中的债务占比加大，杠杆率上升速度较快。,"The residents sector accounts for an increasing share of the total debt in the real economy, and the leverage ratio has risen rapidly."
5736,有关研究表明，中国家庭在金融机构的负债以消费性贷款为主，约占居民负债的2/3，大约是经营性贷款的2倍。,"Relevant studies have shown that Chinese households' debts in financial institutions are dominated by consumer loans, which account for about two-thirds of residents' debts, which is about twice that of business loans."
5737,其中，在消费性贷款中，以住房贷款为主的中长期贷款占八成左右，但从增量看，短期消费贷款增长速度较快，高于中长期贷款。,"Among the consumer loans, medium- and long-term loans dominated by housing loans accounted for about 80%, but short-term consumer loans grow faster than medium- and long-term loans."
5738,除此之外，中国家庭债务率只是统计了家庭部门从金融机构获取的信贷总额，而中国家庭还有不少包括向亲戚朋友借钱在内的民间借贷，存在大规模隐性债务。,"Moreover, the household debt ratio figure obtained in the study is only reflects the total amount of credit that the household sector obtains from financial institutions. In fact, many Chinese households borrow money from private sources including relatives and friends, creating a large amount invisible loans."
5739,看到这样的数据，让人不禁有些瞠目结舌，根据苏宁金融研究院的统计数据显示，1996年中国居民杠杆率只有3%，2008年也仅为18%，但是自2008年以来居民杠杆率开始呈现迅速增长态势，短短六年间翻了一倍，达到36.4%。到了2017年三季度居民杠杆率已经高达48.6%。,"Seeing such data, one cannot help but be stupefied. According to the statistical data of Suning Financial Research Institute, the leverage ratio of Chinese households was only 3% in 1996 and 18% in 2008. But this figure doubled in just six years since the trend of rapid growth of leverage ratio set in, reaching 36.4%. By the third quarter of 2017, the leverage ratio of households has reached 48.6%."
5740,我们再对比一个数据，去年五月份，汇丰银行发布了一项横跨9国、受访者接近上万人的调查报告。,"Let's make another comparison. In May last year, HSBC issued an investigation report involving 10,000 respondents in 9 countries."
5741,这项报告的访问对象为9个国家的“千禧一代”年轻人（出生在1980年至2000年间）。,The investigation was targeted at young people in the millennial generation (born between 1980 and 2000) in nine countries.
5742,报告指出，中国的80、90后年轻人住房拥有率高达70%，遥遥领先第二名墨西哥（46%），也是美国该项指标（35%）的2倍水平。,"The report pointed out that China's young people who were born in 1980s and 1990s have a home ownership rate of 70%, far ahead of Mexico at the second place (46%), and twice the US level (35%)."
5743,这些数据告诉我们一个极有可能出现的问题，那就是相比于买不起房而言，中国居民现阶段最大的潜在“灰犀牛”估计会是还不起债了。,"These figures reveals that compared to the problem of being unable to afford homes, the biggest risk of 'Grey Rhinoceros' for Chinese residents at present is likely to be being unable to repay debt."
5744,二、房债危机为什么才是最为严重的问题？,2. Why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
5745,正如我们之前的分析，虽然我们一直在说中国房价较高，但是相比于世界上其他的国家而言，中国的住房拥有率其实是相当高的，那么与其说房价高买不起房，恐怕现在要问很多朋友的问题是你还得起贷款吗？,"As we have analyzed previously, although we have been saying that China’s housing prices are relatively high, China’s housing ownership rate is actually quite high compared to other countries in the world. So the urgent question facing a lot of friends is whether you can replay the loan rather than the question of whether you can afford a home."
5746,我们纵观全世界的房地产市场，中国的房地产市场由于起步较晚，除了我们之前说的海南之外，尚未出现过大的房地产危机，但是就在十年前的2008年全世界金融海啸的起源就是美国的房地产危机。,"A quick review of the real estate market in the world leads to the conclusion that China’s real estate market hasn't experience major crisis except for the localized crisis in Hainan Province as we mentioned before. This is because commercialization of property is a relatively recent phenomenon in China. However, it's alarming to note that the real estate crisis in the United States triggered a global financial tsunami in 2008, just a decade ago."
5747,而美国房地产危机出现的原因则被归咎于两房：房利美和房地美。,The blame for the real estate crisis in the United States falls on two financial institutions: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
5748,当时在美国的黄金时代，房地产公司为了扩大销售将房子以极低的首付卖给了当时美国的低收入人群，在美国经济向好的时候，房地产市场也是一片欣欣向荣，然而好景不长，随着美国经济出现了增长的停滞，引起了购房者的收入下降，于是大量的家庭消费支出开始下降。,"In the so called 'golden age' of the United States, real estate companies sold their houses with very low down payments to the low-income people in order to expand sales. When the US economy was prosperous, the real estate market was also thriving. However, it did not last long. The stagnation of growth in the U.S. economy caused the income of home buyers to fall, which in turn caused the consumption expenditures of a large number of households began to decline."
5749,但是，当时美国的现状是美国家庭资产的组成部分金融资产和房地产资产，美国的低收入群体几乎所有的家庭资产全部是房地产，而前20%的高收入群体中大部分资产却是金融资产，于是就造成了在美国越是贫穷的人家房地产的负债率就越高。,"Most U.S. families had both financial assets and real estate assets. At that time, almost all household assets of the low-income families were real estates, while the majority assets of the top 20% high-income families were financial assets. As a result, poorer people in the United States have higher debt ratio."
5750,一个严重的事实是这些人都是在经济较好的时候买的房子，所以支付房贷的钱也是以他们较好的收入来计算的，当收入出现了下滑的时候，房贷的压力不仅没有减少甚至因为一些次贷计划变得浮动增加，于是此消彼长之下这些美国家庭的房地产问题就这么逐步演变成为了房地产的危机。,"A grave reality is that these people bought their houses when the economy was prosperous, so the money to pay the mortgage is also calculated based on their better income. When the income declined, the pressure on the mortgage increased as a result of floating nature of some subprime mortgage plans. Thus, the real estate problems of these American families gradually evolved into a real estate crises."
5751,从而有人因为收入过低支付不起房贷，于是银行就开始收回房产，当银行从拖欠贷款的购房者手中收回房产之后，他们会以极低的价格售出，从而导致了该地区的房价一步步下滑，这个过程又引发了房价进一步的下滑，形成了一个恶性循环，当房价下跌到一定的程度之后，越来越多的购房者发现自己的房子价值甚至已经比自己的贷款还低了，于是就有了更多的人停止继续还房贷，又造成了更多的坏账。,"Some people cannot afford to pay their mortgages because their incomes were too low. The banks began to take over the houses from the home buyers who had defaulted on the loan, and then sold them at very low prices, resulting in a step-by-step price fall in the area. This vicious cycle caused a further decline in housing prices. When the housing prices had fallen to a certain extent, more and more home buyers found that their house values became lower than their loans. Thus, more and more people stopped repaying their home mortgages, resulting in a large number of bad debts."
5752,于是，一个巨大的恶性循环就此形成：,"In this way, a huge vicious circle formed:"
5753,“经济不景气——收入下滑——一部分人还不起房贷——银行低价出售欠账人的房子——房价下跌——更多的人停止还房贷——银行又出售——房价又下跌……”,"“Economy downturn – incomes fall – some people can’t repay mortgages – banks sell defaulted houses at low prices – house prices fall – more people stop paying home mortgages – banks sell houses again – prices fall again ..."""
5754,而问题不止如此，因为房价的持续下跌，大家停止还贷把房子给银行之后并不是你就没有债务了，如果银行拍卖房子得到的钱还还不上你欠银行的贷款的话，那么你还是需要接着还钱，简单点说假设你用首付60万，贷款240万买了一套当时价值300万的房子，当房价下跌到这个房子只值200万的时候，你不再还贷把房子给了银行，银行拍卖房子之后，你不仅损失了自己的首付60万，还倒欠银行40万的债务，你还是要接着还钱。,"The problem did not stop there. As house prices continue to fall, a new situation emerged: The money the bank got after auctioning the defaulted house was less than the loan the home buyer owed the bank, the home buyer still need to repay the loan. So stopping repayment does not necessarily mean that you are cleaned of the debt. For example, if you paid a down payment of $600,000 and borrowed $2.4 million to buy a house worth $3 million at the time. When the house price falls to $2 million, you stop to repay the loan and give the house to the bank. After the bank auctions the house, you will not only lost your down payment of $600,000, but also owed $400,000 debts to the bank. You still have to repay the debt."
5755,于是，就在这样一个接一个的恶性循环下，美国的经济逐渐陷于崩溃，最终引发了美国2008年的金融危机。,"Thus, with the effect of such vicious cycle one after another, the U.S. economy gradually collapsed and eventually triggered the U.S. financial crisis in 2008."
5756,所以，现阶段中国家庭债务率的水平达到了46.8%的高位是一件非常需要警惕的问题，这个数据在目前来看还是低于发达国家水平，但是问题的苗头已经开始出现，国家从去年开始就反复强调去杠杆问题，这是一件非常有先见之明的判断，家庭债务率如果放任其继续攀升的话，必然会引发巨大的风险，所以要严防金融风险的出现。,"Therefore, the fact that China’s household debt ratio has reached a high level of 46.8% is a problem that requires great vigilance. Although this figure is still lower than that of developed countries at present, the signs of the problem have already begun to emerge. The central government started to stress the issue of deleveraging repeatedly in the last year, which is a very prescient judgment. If the household debt ratio is allowed to continue to climb, it will inevitably lead to a huge crisis. Therefore, we must strictly guard against the hidden financial risks."
5757,于是有了之后房子是用来住的、不是用来炒的定位，国家更加快建立多主体供给、多渠道保障、租购并举等多重措施，进一步化解潜在风险。,"It's no wonder that the central government has set the tone for the real estate market: Houses are for living, not for speculation. The government are taking multiple measures to resolve potential risks, including increasing land and housing supply and encouraging house renting."
5758,对于我们个人家庭来说，一定要放弃房地产投机思维，买房的时候量力而行，避免自己家庭陷入巨大的负担之中，只有合理的评估自己的收入和负债水平才是一个健康的家庭财富发展道路。,"For our individual families, we must abandon the mindset of speculating on real estate and make purchase according to our own financial capacities. In this way, we can prevent our families from falling under huge financial burden. A reasonable assessment of one's own income and debt levels is essential for healthy growth of family wealth."

5762,万达董事长王健林辛辛苦苦攒了这个比赛，线上线下都在不停地忙活，甚至亲自出席了两场“中国杯”发布会，结果变成了剃头挑子一头热。,"Wang Jianlin, Wanda’s chairman, was struggling with the competition and busy with it both online and offline. He even attended two news conferences of “China Cup"" in person, but it turned out to be a one-sided enthusiasm."
5763,今天不少网购消费者发现在自己快递物流状态中，出现了“雾霾影响”的字眼。,Many online shoppers found the words “Affected by haze” in their express delivery logistics status today.
5764,快递延误原因之一在于，受雾霾天气影响，多地实行交通管制，运力不足。,"The impact of haze is a reason for delays in express deliveries. Traffic restrictions are implemented in many locations, resulting in inadequate delivery capacity."

5768,他已和汉普郡温彻斯特皇家汉普郡医院的高级顾问麻醉师杰夫?沃森医生联手，确保植入过程达到医学标准。,"He has teamed up with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is carried out to a medical standard."
5769,该技术与猫狗芯片植入类似，且只需 30 秒。,"The technology is similar to a microchip implanted for cats and dogs, and takes just 30 seconds."
5770,诺瑟姆先生的公司也会更换各房间和车辆的锁，以与该芯片兼容，每把锁花费 300 英镑。,"Mr Northam's company will also alter locks on houses and cars so they are compatible with the chip, for a cost of £300 each lock."
5771,这位拥有一个孩子的已婚父亲现在已为他家和他的 BMW Z4 都安装了该技术，他只要把手放在方向盘上即可将车启动。,"The married father of one now has technology fitted to both his home and his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel."

5775,"根据《时代》杂志发布的军事记录记载，上个月白宫决定运送一架海军陆战队直升机至南草坪用于彰显美国制造业的巨大荣耀，耗资高达 24,000 美元。","The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000, according to military records released to TIME."
5776,绿白相间的 Sikorsky VH-3D（总统乘坐时也称海军陆战队一号）是白宫 7 月 17 日凸显美国建造项目活动上的重要展品。,"The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is aboard, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House showcasing American construction programs."
5777,总统唐纳德·特朗普、副总统迈克·彭斯和众白宫高级官员巡视了来自全部 50 个州的制造产品。,"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states."
5778,展品有康涅狄格州制造的直升机、一艘缅因州的游艇、一辆威斯康辛州的消防车和一台密西西比州的叉车。,"The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi."
5779,根据负责操作该直升机的部队海军陆战队直升机第一飞行队 (HMX-1) 的记录，白宫军事办公室要求该直升机按日常命令 (FRAGO) 现身，即在该直升机降落在南草坪参加此次“特别”活动前仅 36 小时。,"The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the ""unusual"" event, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter."
5780,活动前一天，HMX-1 指挥官在向上级海军陆战队飞行副司令发送的电子邮件中表示“我只想确认您知晓，因为这此次活动受到高度重视。”,"""I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it's such an unusual high visibility event,"" the commander of HMX-1 emailed his superior, the Marine Deputy Commandant for Aviation, the day before the event."
5781,该信息表明该直升机将于 7 月 17 日大约上午 7 点抵达南草坪参加下午 3 点的活动，在当天晚上 6 点至 9 点草坪清空后才离开。,"The message indicated the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event, and remain until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening."
5782,该信息还表示万一从白宫出发的时间推迟，回航则因为值班时间限制需要第二组机组人员。,"The note adds that should the departure from the White House be delayed, a second aircrew would be needed for the return flight due to duty-hour restrictions."
5783,原机组人员在活动期间在直升机边待命，而保安部队人员在飞机位于地面时在附近待命。,"The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground."
5784,《时代》杂志得到的记录中并未清楚指出最终是否需要第二组机组人员。,It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
5785,《哈奇法案》禁止联邦雇员出于政治目的使用政府财产。,The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
5786,记录指出 HMX-1 曾询问此次活动是否违反了该法案。,Records indicate that HMX-1 inquired about whether the event might violate the provision.
5787,该指挥官写道“我们问的一个问题是这是否违反了《哈奇法案》，并被告知没有违反。”,"""One question we asked was if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and were informed it was not,"" the commander wrote."
5788,“听起来你被锁住了啊，”副司令回复道。,"""Sounds like you are locked,"" the Deputy Commandant replied."
5789,白宫将此次“美国制造”活动定义为官方活动，因此不受《哈奇法案》管辖。,"The ""Made in America"" event was designated an official event by the White House, and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act."
5790,但是即使是官方活动也带有政治色彩。,But even official events have political overtones.
5791,活动中，总统推行当时参议院的议题：医疗改革，并大肆吹捧对政府法规的管控。,"At the event, the President made a push for healthcare reform efforts then underway in the Senate and touted efforts to rein in government regulations."
5792,将海军陆战队一号或空军一号飞机用于政治宣传目的已经不是什么新鲜事。,Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
5793,历届总统都被要求出行需乘坐这些飞机。,Presidents are required to use them for travel.
5794,但是仅为拍照目的将其征用并不常见。,But requisitioning their use solely for a photo-op is unusual.
5795,二月份特朗普就受到关注，当时是在佛罗里达州墨尔本，总统专机慢慢滑行，最终停到了他第一次竞选集会的背景布处，而他的推特账户充斥着对前任总统使用总统专机的抱怨信息。,"Trump drew scrutiny in February when the presidential airplane taxied to the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., and his Twitter account is flush with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential aircraft."
5796,白宫副新闻发言人林赛·沃尔特斯称“白宫因此次‘美国制造’展览而激动不已，此次展览展示了来自全部 50 个州的产品，这些产品均由美国工人使用美国材料制造。”,"""The White House is thrilled with the 'Made In America' showcase that featured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials,"" said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters."
5797,HMX-1 机组人员经常在华盛顿地区附近和南草坪进行飞行训练，练习将美国总统准确安置在白宫。,HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights around the Washington area and at the South Lawn to practice depositing the President of the United States at the White House with inches of precision.
5798,7 月初特朗普在德国参加 G-20 峰会期间，HMX-1 在白宫练习了 58 次着陆。,"When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House."
5799,一位官员称，此次美国制造活动飞行计入本月机组人员训练要求中。,"The flight for the Made in America event counted toward the aircrew's training requirement for the month, an official said."
5800,直升机部队当天也额外飞行了 11 个小时的“非总统支援任务”。,"Unit helicopters also flew an additional 11 hours that day for ""non-presidential support missions."""
5801,白宫方面称纳税人并没有承担此次活动中任何其他道具的费用。,The White House said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other props featured at the event.
5802,Sikorsky 发言人称该公司并未参与安排南草坪直升机展示。,A spokesperson for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in arranging for the helicopter to be displayed on the South Lawn.
5803,HMX-1 并没有保留总统飞行的预算记录，因此要确定此次活动产生的准确费用非常困难。,"HMX-1 doesn't maintain budgetary records for presidential flights, and determining the precise cost incurred by the event is difficult."
5804,"但是根据国防部 2017 财政年度的小时费用记载，VH-3D 的国防部可报销费用为每飞行小时 24,380 美元。","But according to Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour."
5805,部队记录记录了飞机每次从弗吉尼亚州匡提科海军陆战队机场的基地飞行的时间为 30 分钟。,Unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia.
5806,白宫方面称操作该直升机的成本远低于该费用。,The White House argues the true cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
5807,沃尔特斯称“基于可报销费来估计纳税人所出的费用非常有误导性。,"""To place a cost to taxpayers based on the reimbursement rate estimates is highly misleading,"" Walters said."
5808,这些估计的费用包括人员费用、维护费和其他很多包括在年度拨款中的沉没成本。,"""These rate estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other sunk costs that are included in annual appropriations."""
5809,一份 2015 年的 RAND 研究显示，国防部可报销费用并不包括人员费用，但确实包括油费、维护费和订约成本。,"According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do account for fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs."
5810,当时，前白宫新闻发言人肖恩·斯派克为此次活动使用该直升机辩护，,"At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event."
5811,并称“想法是在本周展示美国制造的东西，,"""The idea is to showcase this week things that are made in America,"" Spicer said."
5812,而且我知道 Sikorsky 公司和康涅狄格州都为此感到自豪，他们都为我们的国家安全贡献了一份力量，我猜测就算没有数千也有数百人的工作要依赖于此。,"""And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security, that there are, I assume, hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that."
5813,而且我觉得像大部分美国人一样，我们都为这架直升机和其他军事设备感到自豪，这是无数美国人不辞辛劳作出的成果。,"And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked tirelessly to do."
5814,所以彰显这一点当然并没有不合时宜。”,"So, of course, it's appropriate to highlight that."""
5815,我们并不清楚特朗普在活动中游览南草坪时是否与该直升机互动，但他确实坐上了消防车的驾驶座。,"It wasn't clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn for the event, but he did step into the driver's seat of a fire truck."
5816,在白宫内，特朗普向 Sikorsky 公司代表发表讲话，拿他自己拥有的该公司飞机跟媒体开玩笑。,"Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products."
5817,他说“我很了解 Sikorsky 飞机。我有三架。”,"""I know Sikorsky very well,"" the President said, ""I have three of them."""

5820,关于全面从严治党，习近平总书记有过很多形象的比喻，一同回顾！,"With respect to comprehensively strengthening party discipline, General Secretary Xi Jinping has given many vivid and impressive metaphors, so let’s review them together!"
5821,“老虎”要露头就打，“苍蝇”乱飞也要拍。要推动全面从严治党向基层延伸，严厉整治发生在群众身边的腐败问题。,"We should fight against “tigers” (high-ranking corrupt officials) immediately after we find evidence, and we should also deal with those “flies” (low-ranking corrupt officials) at the same time.

5910,据市场星报报道，从2005年到2011年，我省GDP一举由中部并列“垫底”升至次席。,"Shichang Xingbao reported that between 2005 and 2011, the GDP of Anhui Province rose from joint “bottom” to second at one stroke."
5911,但我省经济增长仍存在投资效率偏低、工业经济缺乏核心竞争力等困境。为此，省经济信息中心最新一期《经济蓝页》建议提高经济增长的质量和效益。,"However, the Province’s economic growth continued to experience difficulties such as low investment efficiency, and a lack of core competitiveness in its industrial economy. To this end, the latest issue of the “Economic Blue Paper” of the Province’s Economic Information Center advised raising the quality and benefit of economic growth."

5913,在工业经济效益上，2011年，在我省占有相当比例的工业能源、原材料等高耗能行业，受市场波动影响较大和产能过剩“双重压力”，同时，家电、汽车等主导产业创新力不足，导致利润微薄。,"In 2011, in terms of industrial economic benefit, high energy consumption industries such as industrial energy and raw materials, which comprised a relatively large proportion of the Province, had to endure “twin pressures” - they were significantly affected by market volatility as well as overcapacity. At the same time, home appliances, automotive and other leading industries lacked innovation, resulting in slim profits."
5914,而大量的投资没有带来相应经济效益，是导致我省经济增长质量和效益不高的重要原因。,"Meanwhile, enormous investment did not bring about the corresponding economic benefit, which was a key factor leading to poor quality and benefit in economic growth."
5915,对此，专家建议，要采取有效措施鼓励企业创新，高校及科研院所的科技成果也要及时向企业“转移”。,"As regards this, experts advised that effective measures should be adopted to incentivize enterprises to innovate. The technical outcomes of Institutions of higher learning and technological research institutes should also be promptly “transferred” to enterprises."
5916,对于工业经济效益不高，专家说，也要积极推动产业兼并重组、优化产业布局、延伸产业链。,"As for low industrial economic benefit, experts said that industry merger and reorganization should be actively advanced, industry structure optimized, and the industry chain extended."
5917,傅家俊赛后说，希金斯开局非常完美，自己以为很快就会大比分败北，但随后他还是坚持自我，终于反败为胜。,"“Higgins had a very perfect start. I thought I might lose the competition very soon. But I didn’t give up, and finally turn the tables,” said Marco Fu after the match."
5918,从集训时间看，这个时间段正好是各队冬训的关键阶段，队中主力被征战，必然将会对备战训练造成相当大的影响。,"Th period of intensive training just meets the key stage of each team’s winter training. With the main force of each team absent, the preparation training will be inevitably affected ."
5919,一方面汽车技术经过一百多年的发展，许多技术已经比较成熟；一方面未来汽车的用户体验更多地取决于人机互动，中兴在IT、网络、车联网系统等领域有优势。,"Automobile technology has developed for more than a century, and a lot of the technology is fairly mature. However, future auto user experience is more dependent on human-machine interaction. ZTE has advantages in the areas of IT, network, and auto networking systems."

5927,英国总工会资深主办人德鲁?达菲 (Drew Duffy) 说：“我们无法从工厂总经理那里清楚了解到托尔克罗斯 (Tollcross) 未来的业务需求和投资计划，这使我们的成员深感担忧。,"GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: ""The fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manager over the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerning our members."
5928,一代又一代的家族在这里工作，而且本地社区和大格拉斯哥地区劳动力高度集中，是高失业和社会剥夺严重的地区体面就业的重要支柱。,"Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the greater Glasgow area, a crucial pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation."
5929,因此，从就业、薪酬和经济繁荣的角度来看，在英国脱欧，生活成本上涨和制造业长期衰退的背景下，格拉斯哥东部地区迫切需要麦维他不断扩大生产网络。”,"So, from the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie's."""
5930,普拉迪斯公司的发言人表示：“托尔克罗斯 (Tollcross) 的厂长昨日刚收到英国总工会苏格兰分会的来信，该公司将会立即进行回复，因为我们重视与雇员和工会代表保持持续接触。,"A spokeswoman for Pladis said: ""The site manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will be responding directly as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives."
5931,两个月前，我们在托尔克罗斯 (Tollcross) 与员工和英国总工会代表举行了例会，公开讨论了一些问题。,We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed openly.
5932,我们与员工进行了讨论，然后，像所有在竞争激烈和经济不明朗的环境中运营的其他公司一样，我们对我们应用于企业和工厂的持续运营模式进行了审查，以便保持竞争力。,"We discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we review our operations on an ongoing basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and sites - in order to remain competitive."
5933,她补充道：“近年来，我们在托尔克罗斯 (Tollcross) 工厂的投资超过 500 万英镑，特别是在生产线和运营改进方面。,"She added: ""In recent years, we have invested over £5m in our Tollcross site, notably on production lines and operational improvements."
5934,我们充分认识到托尔克罗斯 (Tollcross) 作为生产基地的历史地位，如我们在该厂的运营业务有任何变化，员工和工会代表将会第一个知道。”,"We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."""

5937,中新社记者何蓬磊摄近十几年来，随着珠峰登山探险者和旅游者急剧增加，山峰所在地的环保问题日益凸显。,"China News Service/He Penglei: In the last 10 years or so, environmental protection issues at Mount Everest have become increasingly prominent as the number of Mount Everest explorers and tourists increased significantly."
5938,1997年春，西藏自治区登山协会在珠峰北坡发起第一次清扫活动，清理了一批上世纪六七十年代遗留的氧气瓶等生活垃圾。该视频还在当年的东京世界气候大会上专门播放，引起世界关注。,"In the Spring of 1997, the Tibet Autonomous Region Mountaineering Association initiated the first clean-up on the Northern slope of Mount Everest, cleaning up oxygen tanks and other domestic waste left over from the 1960s and 1970s. This video was also specially broadcast at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Kyoto that year, drawing world attention."

5946,但是巴黎圣日耳曼主席三年前曾对足球世界发出过这样的预测吗？,But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?

5948,“我并不担心，因为他们知道如果他们接触我们的任何一位球员，我们必将与他们针锋相对，我们也会联系他们的球员，” 阿尔赫莱菲说。,"""I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players,"" Al-Khelaifi said."
5949,“我们尊重所有俱乐部。,"""We respect all clubs."

5985,“2017 年 8 月 28 日生效的 NAACP 密苏里州旅行咨询中呼吁，因近期密苏里州发生了一系列可疑的种族性事件，所有非裔美籍旅行者、游客以及密苏里州人在密苏里州旅行时应特别注意并采取极其谨慎的态度，特此告知，”该团体的声明宣称。,"""The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein,"" the group's statement reads."
5986,NAACP 指出，最近通过的一项密苏里州法律使得人们更难赢得歧视诉讼，该州执法也一定程度上针对少数群体，这些现象促使该组织发布了旅行警告。,"A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said."
5987,侵犯公民权利的行为正发生在人们身上。,"""You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people."
5988,他们因肤色被停车盘问，被殴打或被杀害，”密苏里州 NAACP 主席罗德·查培尔告诉堪萨斯城星报 (The Kansas City Star)。,"They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed,"" the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star."
5989,“我们收到了许多投诉，数量前所未有。”,"""We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before."""
5990,这是该组织在美国针对某个州发布的第一个此类警告。,It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.
5991,该组织援引了密苏里大学对黑人学生的种族诽谤以及 28 岁田纳西州黑人男性托利·桑德斯的死亡事件。,"The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."
5992,今年早些时候，桑德斯在可疑情况下死亡。他在密苏里州旅行时燃油耗尽，被密苏里州警方在无指控犯罪的情况下拘留。,"Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime."
5993,咨询中还指出，密苏里州总检察长办公室最近的一份报告显示，“与白人相比，该州的黑人司机被停车盘查的可能性要高出 75%”。,The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.
5994,查培尔说：“该份咨询是为了提高人们的意识，警告他们的家人、朋友和同事在密苏里州可能发生的情况。”,"""The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri,"" Chapel said."
5995,“人们需要做好准备，无论是携带保释金前往密苏里州，还是让亲属知道自己在州内旅行”。,"""People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money with them, or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state."""

5997,旅行警告也是对密苏里州新法律的回应，该法律将使起诉住房或就业歧视企业变得更加困难。,The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.
5998,此前，美国各州通过了移民执法法律，要求当地执法部门拘留移民违规人员，美国公民自由联盟 (ACLU) 表示此举会增加种族诉讼数量，并发布了针对德克萨斯州和亚利桑那州的旅行咨询。,"Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling."
5999,旅行警告通常是由美国政府针对其他国家发布的，但最近，咨询团体采取这一方式以应对美国境内的某些法律和趋势。,"Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US."

Whether box office takings could surpass last year’s total of RMB44.069 billion is questionable."

6005,这座中国首都拥有速度高得惊人的互联网，有人脸识别软件等尖端技术，在人工智能方面投入了巨资并且拥有无可匹敌的国际化能量，它对富于探索精神的外国人而言是最激动人心的城市之一。,The Chinese capital is interconnected by amazingly high-speed Internet and has implemented cutting-edge technologies such as face recognition. It has invested heavily in artificial intelligence and has an unmatched capacity of internationalization. It is one of the most exciting cities for foreigners who are eager to explore the world.
6006,据英国广播公司网站1月16日报道，德国侨民克莱门斯·塞希说：“如果我能在那儿成功，我以后在任何地方都能成功。”他引用的是歌手弗兰克·西纳特拉歌颂纽约市的歌词。,"According to a report on the BBC website on January 16, the German expatriate Clemens Sage said: 'If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere.' He quoted a song written by singer Frank Sinatra to praise New York City."
6007,在《旅行者档案》杂志担任创意总监的塞希说：“如果西纳特拉活到今天，他很可能会歌唱北京这样的城市。”他说，生活在这座城市会让你感觉“生活在新时代”，总是能跟上潮流。,"Sage, who served as Creative Director of Traveler Archives, said: ""If Sinatra lives today, he is likely to sing a song for Beijing."" He said that living in this city will make you feel like “living in a new age”, which means that you can always keep up with the trends."
6008,老家位于英格兰、但最近生活在北京的西蒙·诺顿在个人博客网站4Corners7Seas上发表文章说：“人们总体上有一种处于某种宏大事物中心的感觉，这种感觉很难说清楚，但它让许多外国人长久留在那里。他们想看看它会变成什么样，并且希望亲眼见证。”,"Simon Norton, who originates from England had been living in Beijing in recent years, published an article on personal blog site 4Corners7Seas saying: “People generally have a feeling of being at the center of something grand. Although this feeling is hard to describe clearly, it is the reason why so many foreigners stay there for a long time. They want to see what it will become and hope to witness it. ”"
6009,报道称，这座城市优质高速的互联网和对技术友好的环境使日常生活比以往任何时候都更容易。,"According to reports, the city's high-quality, high-speed Internet and technology-friendly environment make everyday life easier than ever before."
6010,来自马尼拉、目前在“北京儿童”网站担任副总编的安迪·佩尼亚富埃尔特说：“北京正在迅速转变为一个无现金社会，互联网把传统钱包的功能整合到智能手机上，使每个人都能更容易地进行许多交易。”,"Andy Peñafuerte, who originates from Manila and is currently the deputy editor-in-chief of the website Beijing Children, said: ""Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society. The Internet integrates the functions of traditional wallets into smart phones, making it easier for everyone to conduct various transactions."""
6011,报道表示，但智能手机只是北京技术雄心的开始，面部识别软件已经十分普及，许多手机应用都使用这种技术来进行银行转账和支付、让人们进入公寓和办公室，甚至用它来核实网约车司机的身份。,"According to reports, smart phones are just the beginning of Beijing's technical ambitions. Face recognition technology is being widely used across the city. Many mobile phone applications use this technology to facilitate bank transfers and payments, grant people access apartments and offices, and even use it to verify identity of the drivers providing car-hailing service."
6012,北京最近还宣布计划斥资138亿元人民币修建一个人工智能科技园，建成后将有逾400家企业在那里落户，它们将专注于开发从生物测定到自动驾驶汽车的各种人工智能技术。,"Beijing recently announced plans to invest 13.8 billion yuan in the construction of an artificial intelligence technology park. When it is completed, more than 400 companies will settle there. They will focus on the development of artificial intelligence technologies ranging from biometrics to self-driving cars."
6013,食品也是中国历年诸多重大节日的核心，参加这些庆祝活动受到外国人的推崇，春节是最重要的社会和经济节日，也是外国人最容易参与的节日之一。,"Food plays a central role in China’s many major traditional festivals. Foreigners are enthusiastic about these festivals. The Spring Festival is the most important festival in both social and economic sense, and it is also one of the most enjoyable festivals for foreigners."
6014,塞希说：“我建议帮助中国朋友为过年做准备，打扫公寓和在家门贴上写有新年祝福语的红色春联同等重要，在除夕那一天，所有的家庭成员都要齐集一堂吃一顿丰盛的大餐，然后守岁到午夜，用绚丽响亮的焰火迎接新年。对外国人而言，与朋友和家人共度这个夜晚的确是一个融入的机会。”,"Sage said: “It's a pleasure for me to help Chinese friends prepare for the New Year. It is equally important to clean the apartment and paste the red spring couplets with blessing words on the door. On New Year’s eve, all family members must gather together to have a good meal and stay until midnight, and finally to celebrate the New Year with fireworks. For foreigners, spending the night with friends and their family is indeed an opportunity for blending. ”"
6015,报道称，北京的外国人数量众多而且在不断增长，但中国的语言障碍以及侨民之间交流的便利很容易成为他们不完全融入当地文化的借口。,"According to reports, a large number of foreigners are living in Beijing and the number is growing. However, the language barrier and the convenience of exchanges between the expatriates can easily become excuses for not fully integrating into the local culture."
6016,塞希说：“一些外国人已经在中国生活多年，但对他们的东道国几乎没有什么体验。如果你最初接触中国人的尝试不算成功，那么你很容易有还是与其他外国人相处更容易的感觉。,"Sage said: 'Some foreigners have lived in China for many years, but they have little experience with their host country. If your initial attempt to interact with the Chinese is not successful, then it is easy for you to feel more comfortable with other foreigners."
6017,”在这些所谓的“老外泡泡”中（“老外泡泡”是指外国人只在外国人中间混，而不接触当地人和当地文化——译者注），外国人在自己的社区里抱团，在西方餐馆吃饭，并且朋友中只有外国人。,"In these so-called 'foreign bubbles' ('Laowai bubble' refers to circles in which foreigners only mixed in with foreigners, without touching local people and local culture -- translator's note), foreigners mingle with each other in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and only make friends with foreigners."
6018,克服这一点最简单的办法就是学习一点普通话——这比人们可能想象的要简单。,The easiest way to overcome problem is to learn a little bit of Mandarin – something easier than one might think.
6019,塞希说：“每周上一两个小时的中文私教课或者学习入门级的广播剧应该会适合每个人的忙碌日程。”,Sage said: “One or two hours of private lessons in Chinese every week or learning entry-level radio dramas should suit everyone’s busy schedule.”
6020,哪怕学几句经典的短句也会对购物、在餐馆订餐或是在出租车上闲聊有帮助。,"Even learning a few classic phrases will help with shopping, ordering a meal in a restaurant, or chatting on a taxi."
6021,报道称，顽固的空气污染也是日常生活中的一个事实，不过近年来的政府努力遏制了一些问题。,"According to reports, persistent air pollution is also a fact of daily life, but the government has tried to curb pollution in recent years."
6022,居民们强调，在污染往往较轻的温暖月份里到户外活动很重要，要把那些蓝天日当作在历史悠久的胡同里徜徉或是探索备受欢迎的日坛公园的机会。,Residents emphasize that outdoor activities are very important in warm months when pollution is often light. It is important to consider those blue sky days as opportunities for rambling in ancient encryptors or exploring the popular Ritan Park.
6023,诺顿说：“北京是能在表面以下发现最多东西的中国城市，你能发现很不错的艺术和音乐活动、纵情的夜生活、历史奇观、超现代的商业区和古老的胡同区。”,"Norton said: ""Beijing is a Chinese city that one can find most things below the surface. You can find very good arts and music activities, indulgent nightlife, historical wonders, ultra-modern business districts and ancient hutong areas."""

6027,欧盟委员会今年4月指控谷歌强迫手机厂商预装谷歌搜索和Chrome浏览器等软件，否则便不允许其使用其他谷歌应用。,"In April this year, the European Commission accused Google of coercing mobile phone manufacturers into installing software such as the Google search engine and Chrome web browser, or they would not be allowed to use other Google applications."

6034,一张图看懂：比特币在世界各地的法律地位,Understand through a picture: Bitcoin's legal status around the world
6035,摘要：除了投机属性天然引发的价格回调，本轮数字货币惨跌也与“宿敌”——监管风险不无关系。,"Abstract: A part from the price correction which is natural in speculation, the current round of digital currency tumble has also to do with the 'sworn enemy'—regulation."
6036,从可视化地图看，东方国家对比特币的态度比西方更为保守，占全球主体的国家仍在观望数字货币合法性，代表“黑天鹅风险”依旧很大。,"From the visualized maps, the attitude of the eastern countries towards Bitcoin is more conservative than that of the West. Most countries in the world are still indecisive about the legitimacy of digital currencies, indicating that the “risk of the black swan” is still looming large."

6038,随着中国、韩国和欧盟等比特币主要市场的监管风暴迭起，以比特币为首的全球数字货币本周以来惨遭血洗，比特币价格周二起跌破1万美元心理整数位，并创三年以来最大单日跌幅。,"As the authorities in major markets of Bitcoin -- such as China, South Korea and the European Union -- take decisive regulatory measures, the digital currency market dominated by Bitcoin has experienced major bloodshed this week. The price of Bitcoin has fallen below 10,000 dollar, recording the biggest one-day drop."
6039,除了投机属性天然引发的价格回调，本轮数字货币惨跌也与一直以来的“宿敌”——监管风险不无关系。,"A part from the price correction which is natural in speculation, the current round of digital currency tumble has also to do with the 'sworn enemy'—regulation."
6040,在这个重要的关口，可视化大数据网站HowMuch.net制作了一份图谱，展现比特币在全球各国的合法性地位和受监管程度。,"At this important juncture, HowMuch.net, a visualization big data website, produced a map showing the legitimacy of Bitcoin and regulation measure in place in countries around the world."
6041,如下图所示，绿色代表比特币的合法市场；橘黄色代表中性市场，虽尚未公开合法化比特币地位，但也没有主要的使用限制；淡粉色代表受限制的市场，即当地政府尝试通过红线政策或监管来方法数字货币的使用；深粉色代表比特币被定义为非法的国家；灰色是尚未置评的国家。,"As shown in the figure below, green represents the legal market for Bitcoin, and orange represents the neutral market. Although there is no place where Bitcoin is acknowledged a legal currency, there are no major restrictions on the use it. The pale pink represents the restricted market, i.e. the local government tries to the use of the digital currency pass by drawing a red line or taking regulatory measures. The deep pink represents countries where Bitcoin is declared as illegal. The gray represents countries that have not yet been rated."
6042,（上图来自HowMuch.Net可视化团队在1月15日制图）,(The above figure was drawn by the HowMuch.Net visualization team on January 15th)
6043,文章指出，从图中非绿色的色块分布可以看出，传统意义上的东方国家对比特币的态度比西方更为保守。,"The article points out that from the distribution of non-green color patches in the graph, it can be seen that the oriental countries in the traditional sense are more conservative towards Bitcoin than the West."
6044,俄罗斯是目前定义比特币为非法的最大国家，中国是比特币最大的受限市场之一，印度是对比特币尚不予置评、还没有出台相关政策的最大国家之一。,Russia is currently the largest country that defines Bitcoin as illegal. China is one of the largest restricted markets for Bitcoin. India is one of the largest countries that have not commented on Bitcoin and have not made relevant policies.
6045,北美和西欧是对比特币接受程度最高的地区，即绿色块的分布更为集中。,North America and Western Europe are the regions that have highest level of tolerance to Bitcoin i.e. where green patches are concentrated.
6046,中东和拉丁美洲各国对比特币的看法呈现明显分化，上述地区的色块分布更为混杂。,"The views of the countries in the Middle East and Latin America on Bitcoin are clearly divided, so, the distribution of color patches in these areas is more mixed."
6047,其中伊拉克、伊朗、土耳其、巴西都是合法的比特币市场，阿富汗、巴基斯坦、沙特、埃及、玻利维亚等对其交易和使用有一定程度的限制，更多的拉美国家对比特币还没有发声。,"Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Brazil are all legitimate Bitcoin markets. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bolivia have some restrictions on the trading and use of Bitcoin. Most Latin American countries have not made any comments about Bitcoin."
6048,综合上述数据可知，在全球受统计的246个国家中，共有99个国家（或占比40%）对比特币的交易和使用不施加限制，即绿色和橘黄色的地区。,"From the above data, it can be seen that of the 246 countries that have been rated, a total of 99 countries (or 40% of the total) haven't imposed any restrictions on the transactions and use of Bitcoin. They are represented by green and orange patches."
6049,有7个国家（或占比3%）是受限市场（淡粉色），有10个国家（或占比4%）定义比特币为非法（深粉色），有130个国家（或占比53%）还没有更多的对待数字货币信息（灰色）。,"Seven countries (or 3%) are restricted markets (pale pink), 10 countries (or 4%) have defined Bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or 53) %) haven't given comments on digital currency (grey)."
6050,这说明，占全球主体（53%，超过半数）的国家仍在观望以比特币为首的数字货币在境内的合法性，也代表了比特币的“黑天鹅风险”依旧很大，因为其中一部分国家最终可能会作出限制数字货币的立法决定。,"This shows that countries that account for the global majority (53%, more than half) are still indecisive about the legitimacy of digital currencies represented by Bitcoin. This means that the “black swan risk” is still very large for Bitcoin, because some of these countries may ultimately make legislation that restrict the use of digital currencies."
6051,文章认为，全球监管机构对数字货币这个新兴类别还没有完全理解，可能是大部分国家还没有作出表态的主要原因。,The article believes that global regulators have not fully understood the digital currency as a new type of currency. This may be the main reason why most countries have not chosen a stance.
6052,尽管比特币的“人气”自去年以来呈指数级增长，并不代表所有国家都感兴趣，可能有些国家担心当地法币因此受到威胁，或更担心数字货币被犯罪组织利用。,"Although Bitcoin’s popularity has grown exponentially since last year, it does not necessarily mean that all countries are interested in it. It's probably that some countries are concerned that the local currency may be undermined by digital currencies or that digital currencies are used by criminal organizations."
6053,华尔街见闻曾撰文详细总结了上周以来针对比特币的国际监管新闻，包括中国开始打击场外类交易所的集中服务在线平台和移动App、韩国仍在考虑关闭数字货币交易所、欧盟认为比特币还没有被广泛接受并警告投资者“赔到血本无归”的风险等。,"Wallstreetcn has published an article summarizing the news related to regulation measures against Bitcoin across the world since last week, including: China starts to crackdown on online platforms and mobile APPs of over-the-counter exchanges; South Korea is still considering to close the digital currency exchanges; the European Union holds the view that Bitcoin has not yet been widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of “losing everything”."
6054,华尔街见闻主编精选《读要闻_BAR_2018：全球央妈开启数字货币元年？》曾提到，从监管、接受/批判、采纳的任一角度来看，2018年都将成为全球央行的数字货币元年。,"Wallstreetcn Editor's selection: Reading News _BAR_ 2018: Global Central Banks Are Ushering Digital Currency? One article points out that 2018 is destined to be the first year of digital currency for central banks across the world, viewing from the perspectives of supervision, acceptance/criticism and adoption."
6055,俄罗斯等大国批评比特币合法性地位的做法，其实也是为了给官方发行数字货币让路。,The act of questioning the legal status of Bitcoin by big countries such as Russia is actually meant to make way for the official issuance of digital currencies.
6056,新华社马德里1月8日电（报道员谢宇智）巴塞罗那新援库蒂尼奥8日在诺坎普首次身披巴萨球衣亮相。,"On January 8th, the Barcelona new aid Philippe Coutinho showed up for the first time in Camp Nou with his Barcelona shirt, the Xinhua News Agency reported in Madrid by reporter Xie Yuzhi."
6057,库蒂尼奥当日上午通过了巴萨的体检，并与巴萨主席巴托梅乌在一份将于2023年夏天到期的合同上签了字。,Coutinho passed a physical examination of Barcelona early that morning and signed with Barcelona president Bartomeu a contract that will expire in the summer of 2023.
6058,随后他作为巴萨球员，在诺坎普近7000名球迷面前亮相。,"Then he appeared in the face of nearly 7,000 Camp Nou fans as a Barcelona player."
6059,据西班牙媒体透露，库蒂尼奥的转会费总额或达到1.6亿欧元（1欧元约合7.77元人民币），是巴萨俱乐部及西甲历史第一身价。,"According to a Spanish media, Coutinho's transfer fee may amount to 160 million euros (1 euro≈ 1.77 Chinese yuan), being the highest paid player in the history of Barcelona and La Liga."
6060,由于眼下库蒂尼奥仍有伤在身，他还需休整近20日才能迎来自己身披巴萨球衣的处子秀。,"As Coutinho is still injured at the moment, he still need recuperate for nearly 20 days before ushering in his debut in the Barcelona shirt."
6061,还有什么神圣的东西？,Is nothing sacred?
6062,现在特朗普的白宫正在瞄准自由女神像,Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty
6063,政权更迭最确定的标志是他们开始攻击雕像之时。,The surest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
6064,美国人和任何人一样都赞同这一点。 因此，2003 年巴格达天堂广场的萨达姆?侯赛因被精心策划地推倒了。,Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully stage-manged toppling of Saddam Hussein in Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.
6065,"斯蒂芬?米勒 (Stephen Miller) 作为特朗普政府的关键智囊之一，在与美国有线电视新闻网 (CNN) 的吉姆?阿科斯塔 (Jim Acosta) 就总统关于严格限制合法移民的提议进行激烈争论时,他肯定知道自己对自由女神像砍出象征性的一斧会发生什么事情。","Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration."
6066,公平地说，米勒并没有攻击雕像本身。,"In fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself."
6067,如果他这样做了，那么一群游船业主和自由主义的追随者一定会将他生吞活剥。,A horde of boat-trip owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did.
6068,但是他确实攻击了塑像的意义，尤其是在 1903 年埃玛?拉撒路的着名诗歌被刻在基座上时（这座纪念碑在此后17年方建成）而具有的意义。,"But he did attack its meaning, and in particular the meaning ascribed to it when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed."
6069,正如米勒斥责阿科斯塔所说：“我不想在这里谈论历史的全部事实，但自由女神像是美国自由照亮世界的象征......。,"As Miller scolded Acosta: ""I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American liberty lighting the world."
6070,你所指的那首诗，那是后来又加上去的，不是原始自由女神像的一部分。”,"The poem that you're referring to, that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."""
6071,事实上，米勒是正确的，但是正如他自己所说的，这不是真正关于历史。,"Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, this is not really about history."
6072,这涉及到拉撒路惊世之语的现代回音，唯一一个国家似乎不仅邀请任何老移民，而且还邀请穷人中最贫穷的人：“你的疲惫、你的穷困、或者你的挤作一团的民众渴望自由呼吸，/苦难的人拒绝你拥挤的海滩。”,"It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: ""Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."""
6073,不存在“苦难的人拒绝”在我们的屏幕变得更刺眼的一刻。,"There has never been a time when the ""wretched refuse"" has been more visible on our screens."
6074,米勒并没有从事过文学评论工作，他清楚地表明，这些人在特朗普时代的美国不会受到欢迎。,Miller was not engaging in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
6075,这种关于雕像意义的冲突是更广泛的政治和文化战争的一部分：这实际上是与美国精神相冲突。,This conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a conflict about the meaning of America.
6076,拉扎鲁斯 (Lazarus) ，以及她的、在她去世后举行活动将她的诗句铭刻在基座上的朋友们，很清楚他们正在参与的行为具有高度政治性。,Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act.
6077,该雕塑的目的是通过作为自由女神的女性化身的、古老的经典比喻来表达法国和美国共和主义之间的联系。,"The sculpture was intended to mark the connections between French and American republicanism by representing in a well-worn classical trope, the female embodiment of Liberty."
6078,"拉撒路改变了这个意思：在她的诗中，女性形象不再抽象,她要发声。",Lazarus changed that meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.
6079,她给自己起了一个非常不同的名字：流放之母。,And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of Exiles.
6080,"这首诗与这幅画的结合是一场成功的女权主义政变,并且是对美国本土主义的毁灭性打击。",The marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
6081,就像拉撒路改变雕像的意义一样，右翼者一直想要把它改回原意。,"And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, rightwingers have long wanted to change it back."
6082,伟大的演讲者拉什?林博 (Rush Limbaugh) ，是特朗普来临时的一位施洗者，他在 2010 年认为，自由主义并不是邀请任何人，而他现在是一名早期的新保守主义者，将美国的智慧火焰带给愚昧的世界：“自由女神是勇往无前的。,"The great loudmouth Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting anyone in, but is rather an early neocon, taking the American flame out to the benighted world: ""Lady Liberty is stepping forward."
6083,她本意是将自由的火炬从美国带到世界的其他地方。,She is meant to be carrying the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world.
6084,火炬不是照亮美国的道路。”,"The torch is not to light the way to the United States."""
6085,不同寻常的是，林博实际上被一些东西所打动。,"Rather unusually, Limbaugh actually hit on something."
6086,雕像的意义完全取决于认知的角度。,The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the angle of perception.
6087,拉撒路极富想象力的做法就是能够看到它。当疲惫的，可怜的但充满希望的人会在经过漫长而往往可怕的旅程后，可以在船甲板上看到它。,"Lazarus's great imaginative act was to see it as it would be seen by exhausted, wretched but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often dreadful journeys."
6088,从表面上看，这涉及到那些寻求庇护、有机会改善生活的人们看待世界的角度问题。,It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to better their lives.
6089,她的雕像向他们传达且需要他们听到的希望和欢迎的本意。,Her statue speaks back to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
6090,当然，这不是米勒和特朗普曾想要承认的观点。,"And of course, this is not the perspective Miller and Trump want ever to recognise."
6091,他们火炬不是为了照亮道路，而是为了点燃他们唯一力量来源的仇恨。,"Their torch is meant not to light the way, but to inflame the hatreds that are their only source of power."
6092,2006年，萨顶顶凭借独特的音乐风格加盟环球唱片，成为与环球英国总部签约的第一个中国人。,"In 2006, Sa Dingding, with her unique musical style, joined Universal Music Group, and became the first Chinese national to sign a contract with Universal Music Group’s headquarters in the UK."

6094,艾里德?多伊尔 (Eilidh Doyle) 回忆起当时英国国家队只有两名苏格兰人。,Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots made the GB team
6095,英国田径协会执行主任尼尔?布莱克表示，世锦赛小组中的由 16 名强壮的苏格兰人组成的分队将对“国家队做出巨大贡献”。,"UK Athletics' performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championships squad will make ""a massive contribution to the team."""
6096,被挑选参加于周五开幕的 2017 年伦敦田径世锦赛的苏格兰田运动员数量创下历史之最。,"A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday."
6097,布莱克认为，“苏格兰正取得非同寻常的发展”，英国田径运动员必须从中学习。,"Black believes ""there's something special evolving"" in Scotland and UK athletics must learn from that."
6098,“我们接受并设法理解这一点，而且我们会坚持下去直到我们取得成功 ”，布莱克说。,"""We embrace it and we're trying to understand it and we'll push on that until we work it out,"" Black said."
6099,“我找苏格兰体育学院的的人员谈话。他们认为这与他们的作为有关。,"""I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done."

6102,就连街头人士也这么认为。,"And the guy on the corner street, too."
6103,无论情况如何，这都是极其辉煌的。“,"Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."""
6104,"多位苏格兰田径运动员是奖牌角逐者，包括劳拉?缪尔 (Laura Muir) 和安德鲁?布查特 (Andrew Butchart) ，他们将在 5,000 米与穆?法拉 (Mo Farah) 一比高低，而艾里德?多伊尔 (Eilidh Doyle) 则被小组选为队长。","Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will race against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle was voted by the squad to be team captain."
6105,“艾里德有点谦虚。,"""Eilidh is slightly modest."
6106,她的队长演讲真是令人难以置信 ”，布莱克说道。,"Her captain's speech was incredible,"" says Black."
6107,“许多田径运动员员，无论他们是否为苏格兰人，或不论在何地生活或训练，走出房门都满怀自豪，干劲十足地走出房门。,"""A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of that room feeling hugely proud and really motivated."
6108,艾里德自然投入的激情和真感情很不错。”,"The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally put into it were great."""
6109,这名将在其第五次世锦赛中参加 400 米跨栏比赛的英联邦银牌得主表示，英国国家队中有 16 名苏格兰人，这是“令不可思议的”。,"The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it's ""incredible"" 16 Scots are in the British team."
6110,此前，参加世界大赛的苏格兰田径运动员人数最多为7人，也就是 1983 年和2015年取得的参赛人数。,"Scotland's previous best total of athletes at the worlds was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015."
6111,中跑选手缪尔是领军人物。在过去一年中创她下了五项英国记录和两项欧洲纪录。,"Middle-distance runner Muir is leading the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year."
6112,她将参加 1500 米和 5000 米项目比赛。,"She will go in the 1500m and the 5,000m."
6113,参加 1500 米项目比赛的克里斯?奥黑尔则是另一位值得关注的苏格兰选手，之前，她在赛季取得了很好的成绩，分别在英国国家对预选赛和奥运周年赛中获胜。,"Chris O'Hare, who runs in the 1500m, is another Scot to watch, following a great season that included victory at the British Team trials and the Anniversary Games."
6114,多伊尔回想起她参加第一次世界锦标赛，当时队里唯一的另一名苏格兰人是李?麦康奈尔 (Lee McConnell) 。,"Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell."
6115,队长说，令她深感自豪的是，她的这么多同胞不但加入团队中，而且在一些情况下，还将挑战奖牌，角逐进入决赛。,"The team captain says she's ""hugely proud"" of the fact so many of her compatriots have not only made the team, but, in some cases, will be challenging for medals and competing to make finals."
6116,“成为国家队队长的特别之处在于它是由国家队的其他队员投票选出的。因此，知道你的队友投票选你去争取极为不寻常的成就，无论如何，对我来说，这都是很大的荣幸”，她补充道。,"""The special thing about being team captain is that it was voted for by the other members of the team, so that it was such a huge honour anyway but to know that your teammates have voted for you and chosen you made it extra-special for me,"" she added."
6117,“当然，我为所有的苏格兰队员感到非常自豪。,"""Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who've made the team."
6118,这只是表明我们走了多远。,It just shows how far we've come.
6119,而且他们都是这里的老牌田径运动员，即将朝荣登领奖台的目的迈进的田径运动员。,"And they're here as well-established athletes, athletes that are going to be looking to get on podiums."
6120,我的队长致辞如何？,As for my captain's speech?
6121,嗯，我认为它非常棒。,"Yeah, I think it went well."
6122,我刚才参照这一事实，即在这种情况下，我们是非常幸运的，因为我们在主场举行世锦赛。,I just drew on the fact that we're very lucky in this situation in that we've got a home World Championships.
6123,因此，我们借助主场支持，以及因回到奥林匹克体育场而得以壮大，这才真正重要。,So it's really just the importance of drawing on that home support and thriving on the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
6124,我将获得第二次机会参加比赛，而那里的氛围将妙不可言。”,"I'm getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such an amazing atmosphere out there."""
6125,2016年华为员工共18万，雇员费用高达1218亿，同比增长了21%。,"In 2016, Huawei had total staff strength of 180,000, with wages amounting to RMB121.8 billion, up 21% year-on-year."
6126,在脸书上屏蔽批评者：如果你不能忍受选民的责难，就不要竞选公职,"Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't run for public office, if you can't take heat from voters"
6127,我们的国父了解不良媒体的作风。,The father of our country knew something about bad press.
6128,美国人都爱华盛顿，但不久之后，各大报纸就开始猛烈抨击他的一切，从国内政策到政治原则，一个都不放过。,"Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start slamming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles."
6129,他对这些批评很恼火，毫无疑问。,"He chafed at the criticism, sure."
6130,但是他并没有把这些批评者噤声。,But he did not silence his critics.
6131,因为早在 1783 年，华盛顿就说过，“言论自由被剥夺——我们就会像羔羊一样在沉默和愚昧中被宰杀。”,"Because back in 1783, Washington said, ""the freedom of Speech may be taken away - and, dumb &amp; silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter."""
6132,这让我想到了马里兰州的州长拉里·霍根，他需要向华盛顿学习。,"That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington."
6133,霍根的职员屏蔽并删除了至少 450 人的帖子，因为他们在他的脸书官方主页上发表自己的观点。,Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.
6134,美国公民自由联盟本周早些时候就此对他提起了诉讼。,And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.
6135,该州长的职员认为此次诉讼十分草率，网上报道充斥着他们的强烈反抗：“谁在乎？”,"The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was rich with a ""who cares?"" backlash."
6136,很多人说“这只是脸书而已。”,"""It's only Facebook,"" plenty of folks said."
6137,但，这很重要。,But it matters.
6138,这一点尤其重要，因为面对的是霍根这样的人。,And it especially matters when it's a guy like Hogan.
6139,这是一位在一个民主占大多数的州担任州长的共和党人，而且他还出奇地受欢迎。,This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is astonishingly popular.
6140,在全国 50 位州长中，他得到的好评位列第二。,He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
6141,霍根并不是一个反动的急躁分子。,Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
6142,他平稳掌管马里兰州，严格遵守规则。,He's shown a steady hand in leading his state and a stern adherence to principles.
6143,他也非常善于将脸书作为和选民联络感情的主要方式，戏谑地在主页上首次展示他化疗后的秃头。,"He's also been pretty deft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents, playfully debuting his hairless head after chemo treatments on his page."
6144,所以屏蔽来到州长主页评论的人完全没有必要，最终也十分危险。这个主页是一个公共论坛，是由公众纳税供养的职员标榜的官方管理平台。,"So blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is a public forum, labeled as official and administered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."
6145,在《华盛顿邮报》的一次采访中，霍根的发言人阿米莉亚·沙斯为这位州长的行为辩护说，她认为屏蔽他们的评论不过是想让他们克制一点。,"In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them."
6146,但是他们过分草率地将其描述为席卷网络的洪水猛兽或愤世嫉俗者。,But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful folks lashing out online.
6147,《华盛顿邮报》与被霍根屏蔽的人面对面交谈过。,The Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
6148,他们只不过是普通人在跟自己选出的领导对话：他们的身份是老师、小企业主和牧师，并不是什么洪水猛兽。,"And they're just that - real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a pastor, not trolls."
6149,他们纷纷表示自己的评论有深度、有敬意，并不下流。,"They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."
6150,这位牧师在他的帖子中引用了《圣经》的话，呼吁霍根铭记他的天主教信仰。,"The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith."
6151,马里兰州鲍伊的大律师拉克希米·萨尔马·拉马尼并没有愤世嫉俗，但是她询问了关于仇恨犯罪的问题。,"Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes."
6152,她在《华盛顿邮报》的新闻故事评论部分中写道，“我很礼貌地评论道，我对他没有回复仇恨犯罪和其他最近的新闻事件表示失望。,"""I politely commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items,"" she wrote in the comment section of The Post's news story."
6153,我同样也不喜欢一帮人对同一个话题发表评论，因为这些人会直接被某些人忽视，认为他们是所谓的从众心理，而不是把他们当成一群忧国忧民的公民。”,"""I also do not appreciate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same topic, they are immediately disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort, rather than recognized as a large group of concerned citizens."""
6154,州长职员所称的“密集垃圾信息轰炸”在其他人看来可能是“坚持主张”。,"What the governor's staff called a ""concentrated spam attack"" others would probably call ""advocacy."""
6155,脸书时代让修改一条信息变得轻而易举，只需要屏蔽一个批评者或删除一条负面评论。,The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
6156,而且还清除得远比过去干净，在过去那个年代要做到同样的效果需要派遣职员外出搜集并焚毁带批评言论的报纸或者将抗议者逮捕或噤声。,"It's a lot cleaner than the old days, when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arresting and silencing protesters."
6157,但是那确实是现在正在发生的事，不过是在数字层面上。,"But that's exactly what's happening, only digitally."
6158,霍根不是第一个因在脸书和其他社交媒体上噤声他人而受到指责的公共官员。,Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.
6159,特朗普总统就正被推特用户起诉，因为他在推特上屏蔽了他们。,President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.
6160,上周在弗吉尼亚州出现了一个里程碑式的裁决，就是关于此类问题的。,One of the first landmark rulings on this issue came down last week in Virginia.
6161,据美国亚历山大市的地区法官詹姆斯·c·卡察里斯称，劳登县监督委员会主席从她的脸书主页屏蔽选民的行为违反了第一修正案。,"The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page."
6162,肯塔基州州长马特·贝文 (R) 也因其对脸书和推特的使用而受到美国公民自由联盟的光顾。,"And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also got a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter."
6163,这不应该这么难。,This shouldn't be so hard.
6164,在华盛顿时代，负担得起的邮费和互联网有着相似的影响力。,"In Washington's time, the era of affordable postage had an impact much like the Internet."
6165,新闻报纸的数量在 1776 年到 1800 年间翻了四番，还有人写匿名信猛烈批评他的领导。,"The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers hammered his leadership."
6166,而且甚至在那个时候，华盛顿也有针对他的匿名洪水猛兽。,"And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls."
6167,人们使用尤里克拉、瓦列里乌斯、贝利撒留、波久斯等假名写信给报社严厉批评华盛顿的决策。,"People using the pseudonyms ""Juricola,"" ""Valerius,"" ""Belisarius,"" and ""Portius"" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington's decisions."
6168,根据乔治·华盛顿报纸网上项目收集的历史文件记载，他的办公室被请愿书淹没了，都在批评他在和英国签订的《英国国王陛下与美利坚合众国友好、通商与航海条约》上的态度。,"Petitions criticizing his stand on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project."
6169,但是他没有将他们噤声。,But he did not silence them.
6170,言论自由、不同政见自由和演讲自由是这个国家的根基。,"Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse lie at the very foundation of our nation."
6171,而真正的领导者需要接受这一点。,And true leadership means accepting that.
6172,楼市一丝丝的风吹草动都牵动着人们的敏感神经。,Any movement in the property market would have an impact on the sensibilities of the general public.
6173,限购是很多城市房地产调控政策的一道硬杠杠。,Purchase quota is a fixed threshold many cities would adopt when implementing real estate control measures.
6174,2017年5月，济南出台规定，本科生连续缴社保半年，可享有本地常住户口居民同等购房政策；,"In May 2017, Jinan issued regulations stating that undergraduates who make social security contributions consecutively for half a year will be entitled to be treated under the same residential property purchase policies as that of local residents with permanent residency."
6175,6月，武汉出台政策，规定大学生毕业3年内凭毕业证和就业证即可落户。,"In June, Wuhan issued policies that stipulate that university students may settle in the city within three years of graduation based on their graduation certificate and employment permit."
6176,随后政策加码，官方表示，“大学生可以低于市场价20%的价格买房”；,"After the policy was enhanced, officials stated that “university students are entitled to purchase residential property at a 20% discount to market price”."
6177,7月，成都出台规定，外地大学本科及以上学历的青年人才，凭毕业证即可申请落户成都。,"In July, Chengdu issue regulations stating that young talent with overseas university bachelor’s degree or higher academic qualifications may apply to settle in Chengdu based on their graduation certificate."
6178,除此之外，还有昆山、上海临港等城市或区域也出台了 “人才引入”相关政策，对人才购房落户降低门槛。,"In addition, Kunshan, Lingang in Shanghai, as well as other cities or regions also issued relevant “talent introduction” policies, and lowered the threshold for buying residential property and settling locally for talents."
6179,张宏伟认为，这实际上是各大城市对于人口尤其是人才的争夺，留住人口尤其是人才，城市才具有竞争力，这才是这些房地产政策最重要的意义。,"Zhang Hongwei believed that this was, in fact, large cities competing for population, particularly talent. Only by retaining population, particularly talent, can a city be competitive. This then, was the key significance of these real estate policies."
6180,有人甚至认为，这意味着楼市“限购”取消的时机已到。,Some even believed that this implied that the time has come to abolish residential property “purchase quotas”.
6181,尔冬升导演当日表示，拍摄计划由来已久，第一次改编剧本是在1999年的时候，甚至还准备找金城武来饰演燕十三。,Director Derek Yee said that day that he had plans to film for a long time. The first time the screenplay was adapted was in 1999. He was even prepared to get Takeshi Kaneshiro to play the role of Yan Shisan.

6837,也是新时代坚持和发展中国特色社会主义的坚强精神支撑,It is also a strong spiritual support to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.

6839,在学懂弄通做实上下功夫,Make great efforts on learning and mastering.
6840,要深化对红船精神等革命精神的学习宣传，开展形式多样的教育实践，引导人们积极投身新时代中国特色社会主义伟大实践。,"We should deepen the study and publicity of the revolutionary spirit, such as the spirit of the Red Ship, and carry out various forms of educational practice to guide people in actively participating in the great practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era."

6849,印尼金洲的贫穷与死亡,Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold
6850,巴德汀娜·戴杰做饭的时候不用炉子。,"When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove."
6851,她甚至很少用锅。,She rarely even uses a pot.
6852,"她的木屋位于印度尼西亚巴布亚省帕尼艾县首府埃纳罗塔利,这位家庭主妇通常只是把一个红薯——当地人称其为“nota”——直接放进火里。","In her wooden home in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai regency in the restive Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually just places a sweet potato - known locally as ""nota"" - directly into the fireplace."
6853,半个小时后，这烧焦的红薯就被一双没有洗过的手迫不及待地拿了出来，狼吞虎咽地吃掉。,"After half-an-hour, the charred tuber is retrieved and devoured with eager, unwashed hands."
6854,戴杰坐在泥地上——她没有家具，这里也是她做日常家庭杂务的地方，比如洗衣服，洗衣服的水十分浑浊，都是从附近的沼泽地里弄来的。,"Degei sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - which is where she also performs her daily chores, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp."
6855,一个没有屋顶的房间里放着一个水桶，这就是户外厕所。,A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
6856,她是丈夫四个妻子中最年轻的那个，所以她没有被分到田地来照料。,"As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she has been assigned no fields to tend."
6857,一夫多妻现象在这里很常见。,Polygamy is common here.
6858,当然工作到很晚会很危险：村里大部分男人都没有工作，而且很多都烂醉如泥，加上这里有很多士兵。,"Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most of the village men are unemployed and many drink heavily, plus there are the soldiers."
6859,她说：“没人敢在下午 5 点以后在村里走动。”,"""No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.,"" she says."
6860,这是巴布亚高地日常生活的罕见一瞥，这里曾经是荷兰的殖民地，1969 年全民公投后并入印度尼西亚，但那次公投也备受争议，当时只有 1026 名长辈被强迫在占领此地的军队面前通过举手表决投票。,"It's a rare glimpse of daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was absorbed into Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum, when just 1,026 elders were forced to vote through a public show of hands before occupying troops."
6861,目前强烈要求独立、反对荷兰统治的运动很快又将矛头指向雅加达政府，因为该政府对该地区实行高压统治，隔绝外国记者和维权人士。,"An existing movement agitating for independence against Dutch rule swiftly turned its ire against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, barring foreign journalists or rights monitors."
6862,2003 年，该省正式分裂为巴布亚省和西巴布亚省，而巴布亚新几内亚独立控制该岛东部。,"In 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua, with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island."
6863,埃纳罗塔利位置偏远，荒无人烟；要到这里来需要从省会查亚普拉坐 90 分钟飞机到那比雷，然后租车行驶 5 个小时，一路胃里翻江倒海。,"Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate; the journey here involves a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, and then a stomach-churning five-hour drive by hire car."
6864,这里没有公共交通。,There is no public transport.
6865,"在这个大约有 19,000 人的城镇里，木屋外环绕着竹栅栏，褶皱的铁皮屋顶是各类由铁锈制成的黄褐色的遮盖物。","The town of some 19,000 people consists of wooden houses ringed by bamboo fencing, corrugated iron roofs transformed by rust into varying tawny shades."
6866,很少有印尼人来到里，更别说新闻记者，也几乎没有外国人。,"Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners."
6867,在基督教传道士到来之前，Mee Pago 巴布亚人信奉一个叫 Uga Tamee 的神。,"Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee."
6868,这里也还有其他的改变。,"There were other changes, too."
6869,戴杰说“我们穿不惯这些衣服。”她指的是她那颜色亮丽的手织头巾、深色衬衫和鲜艳的半裙。,"""We were not used to wearing these clothes,"" says Degei, indicating her vividly colored, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and a bright skirt."
6870,“我们以前只用树叶盖住身体。”,"""Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies."""
6871,巴布亚是印度尼西亚最贫穷的省份，这里 28% 的人生活在贫困线以下，也是亚洲婴儿死亡率最高而识字率最低的地区。,"Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia."
6872,但是这里也是印尼的金洲。,But it is also Indonesia's land of gold.
6873,"帕尼艾县地处高地，面积大约与新泽西州相同，拥有 153,000 人。世界上最大、最有利可图的金矿格拉斯伯格距离这里只有 60 英里，该金矿由总部位于凤凰城的费利浦·麦克莫兰铜金公司所有。","The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, lies just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province around the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people."
6874,仅在 2015 年，费利浦就在这里开采了大约价值 31 亿美元的金矿和铜矿。,"In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here."
6875,此外，巴布亚的木材资源十分丰富，估计价值为 780 亿美元。,"In addition, Papua boasts timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion."
6876,然而这些丰富的资源也是巴布亚人悲剧的来源，印尼强大的军事力量是因此才得以一直压制着他们。,"These riches are, however, a source of misery for Papuans, ensuring Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence."
6877,"《纽约时报》一份 2005 年的调查报道显示，费利浦在 1998 年至 2004 年间向当地军事人员和部队支付近 2 千万美元，单单一位官员就高达 150,000 美元。","A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer."
6878,巴布亚人对独立自主的诉求越来越强烈，这威胁到了这位金主，他们因而遭受了残忍的待遇。,"Papuan calls for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose, and are dealt with mercilessly."
6879,据维权人士称，1969 年以来，有超过 50 万巴布亚人被杀害，数千人被印尼军队强奸、折磨和关押。,"According to rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969."
6880,据亚洲人权委员会称，1970 年代在巴布亚部落高地的大规模屠杀已升级为种族灭绝。,"Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission."
6881,"单单去年印尼警方就逮捕了 3,900 多名和平抗议者。","Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone."
6882,天主教布里斯班总教区 2016 年的一份报告《我们将会失去一切》囊括了对前一年昭昭恶行的证明，比如法外处决、折磨——另一份报告称强奸和电邢尤其普遍——以及对和平游行示威的残酷镇压。,"We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, contains testimony of atrocities committed the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - rape and electrocution are especially popular, according to another report - and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations."
6883,人权观察组织印尼研究员安德里亚斯·哈尔索诺称，“暴力事件每天都在发生，因此很难计算受害者的人数。”,"""It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week,"" says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch."
6884,巴布亚的资源招来印尼以外的大批移民，压迫便开始了。,The screws have tightened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
6885,该省 350 万人口中有 83% 是基督徒，但是穆斯林经济移民从人口稠密的爪哇岛、加里曼丹岛、苏门答腊岛、苏拉威西岛来到这里以后，其人口结构就发生了变化。,"The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi."
6886,爪哇人的小吃摊出售炸鸡和蔬菜混合的加多加多，配以花生酱。,Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado mixed-vegetables served with peanut sauce.
6887,当地人努力抗争。,Local people struggle to compete.
6888,24 岁的帕尼艾当地人阿波斯·尤搬到了省会查亚普拉去找工作，他解释道“那些移民开始在传统市场以比当地巴布亚人更低的价格出售鸡肉和蔬菜。,"""The migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans,"" explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work."
6889,这让当地巴布亚人——巴布亚女人 ( mama-mama)——失去了她们的市场。”,"""It made the native Papuans - the mama-mama [the women] of Papua - lose their market."""
6890,印尼总统佐科·维多多（人们常称其为佐科维）在他 2014 年的竞选活动上发誓要解决巴布亚的不平等问题和滥用职权问题。,"Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his election campaign in 2014."
6891,这位曾经的木匠通往雅加达总统府的道路受到了全部 29 个地区中 27 个地区的支持——包括帕尼艾。,The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's total 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
6892,但是巴布亚什么也没有改变，今天，当地人感觉遭到了背叛。,"But precious little has changed in Papua, and today local people feel betrayed."
6893,尤说“我们已经心碎了，2014 年我们给佐科维投了票，希望他能实现我们的愿望，重新恢复公平。”,"""Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, with the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored,"" You says."
6894,事实上，在佐科维 10 月份就任仅仅两个月后，帕尼艾就遭遇了最可怕的噩梦。,"In fact, Paniai suffered a nadir just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration."
6895,2014 年 12 月 7 日，埃纳罗塔利 11 名儿童在外面的篝火前唱着圣诞颂歌，两名印尼士兵突然骑着摩托车冲了过来。,"On Dec. 7, 2014 a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorbike broke through the gloom."
6896,受惊的孩子们告诉他们应该打开车头灯。,The startled children told them that they should turn on their headlights.
6897,据当地牧师亚伟特·特拜称，其中一名士兵对他们的语气不满，随后带着四名士兵回来了。,"One of the soldiers took umbrage at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local Pastor Yavedt Tebai."
6898,受害者和目击者称这些喝醉的士兵用他们的枪把追着这群孩子打。,"The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses."
6899,然后其中一名士兵对着这群孩子开了枪。,Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
6900,16 岁的尤利安努斯·叶墨因被打得严重而昏迷。,"One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly he fell into a coma."
6901,几个小时后，附近政府机构选举委员会大楼燃起熊熊大火，第二天事件升级。,"A couple of hours later, the nearby government Election Commission building was set ablaze, and things escalated the following day."
6902,"大约 1,000 名年轻巴布亚男子、女人和儿童聚集在当地警察局和军事指挥中心前的一个足球场要求伸张正义。","About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice."
6903,他们带着仪式用的猎弓，跳着巴布亚 Mee Pago 部落的 waita 舞——绕圈奔跑，并模仿鸟鸣。,They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - running in circles and simulating birdsong - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
6904,部分抗议者开始往军事经常岗哨扔石头。,Some protesters started hurling stones at police and military posts.
6905,根据《时代》杂志看到的一份官方文件记录，当情绪持续激化，士兵们通过内部无线电收到命令：“如果人群抵抗超过三次，立即枪决。”但这份文件并没有向当地媒体发布。,"As tempers grew more heated, an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio: ""If the masses offer resistance more than three times, shoot them dead,"" it said, according to an official document seen by TIME that has not been released to the local media."
6906,56 岁的耶雷米亚斯·卡亚木是埃纳罗塔利 Kego Koto 街区的首领，他感觉到了即将有危险发生，于是呼吁人群冷静，并恳求他们回家。,"Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and appealed for calm, imploring the crowd to go back home."
6907,但没人有心情听他说。,Nobody was in the mood to listen.
6908,他站在他那栋颜色鲜艳的木屋的门廊上告诉《时代》杂志“当我回过头来的时候，我的左腕突然中枪。”,"""When I turned around I suddenly got shot in my left wrist,"" he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house."
6909,卡亚木现在仍然不知道是谁开的枪，但他说子弹来自聚集的士兵之中。,Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of amassed soldiers.
6910,他又说“当时很挤，他们开了很多枪。”,"""It was crowded, many shots were fired,"" he adds."
6911,据当地人奥尔夫尤斯·尤尔的堂兄弟称，他目睹了枪击，看到奥尔夫尤斯·尤尔身中三枪。,"Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shootings."
6912,尤哈内斯悲伤地告诉《时代》杂志，“我跑过去检查他的身体看是不是他，,"""I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,"" Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, told TIME somberly."
6913,我发现他已经死了……我亲吻了他。”,"""I saw he was dead ... I kissed him."""
6914,巴布亚警方总督察尤杰·门德告诉记者，他的下属只是在“保护”警察局，因为警察局受到了袭击。,"The Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only ""securing"" their station because it was under attack."
6915,2015 年巴布亚警方发言人、警察局长普吉奥·苏利斯提奥称“有人威胁要杀我们的时候，我们必须自卫。,"""We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,"" Papua Police spokesperson, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015."
6916,这是关乎生死的问题。”,"""It's a matter of life and death."""
6917,据人权观察组织称，五名年轻抗议者被杀，还有更多人受伤。,"According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured."
6918,第二天关于此次杀戮的消息只在雅加达慢慢传开。,News of the killings only filtered through to Jakarta the following day.
6919,三个星期后，佐科维在查亚普拉作了一次声情并茂的演讲，对受害者家人表示深切同情，并发誓要解决巴布亚历史遗留的滥用职权问题。,"Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathies with the victims' families and vowed to address the historic abuses in Papua."
6920,他说“我希望此案能尽快解决，这样未来就不会再发生这样的事。”,"""I want this case to be solved immediately so it won't ever happen again in the future,"" he said."
6921,2016 年 10 月安全部长维兰多称他要设立一个非司法机制来解决侵犯人权这一历史遗留问题。,Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up a non-judicial mechanism to settle historic human-rights violations.
6922,但是推脱的借口也几乎立马响起。,But the excuses started almost immediately.
6923,他说，“大部分的侵犯发生在很久以前。,"""Most of the violations occurred a long time ago."
6924,有些是在 90 年代和 2000 年代初。,Some were in the '90s and in early 2000s.
6925,重点是我们已致力于解决这些侵犯，但是这还需要一个过程。”,"The point is we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes to go through,"" he said."
6926,然后 6 月 5 日在雅加达，维兰多在与《时代》杂志对话时出尔反尔，他说他没有在巴布亚建立申诉机制的计划。,"Then Wiranto backtracked when speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he has no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua."
6927,相反，他说“一切会依法解决。”,"Instead, ""All will be settled by law,"" he said."
6928,联合国已经就 1999 年东帝汶血腥的独立投票中 1000 多人死亡事件以“反人权罪”对维兰多提起控诉，但他说巴布亚地区 11 宗人权侵犯案已经得到解决，包括帕尼艾事件。,"Wiranto, who the U.N. has indicted for ""crimes against humanity"" relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident."
6929,帕尼艾事件受害者家属对这些说辞嗤之以鼻。,Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.
6930,尤哈内斯说“在过去的三年中，我已经接受了四次采访，但是事情完全没有进展。”,"""I've been interviewed four times for the past three years, but there has been no progress at all,"" Yohanes says."
6931,多年后他说“我累了。”,"""I'm tired."""
6932,他现在仍然生活在恐惧之中。,"He says that years later, he still lives in fear."
6933,他说“我很害怕。,"""I'm afraid,"" he says."
6934,我害怕被军队逮捕，害怕被枪杀。”,"""I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."""
6935,他的兄弟尤卡布斯也认为帕尼艾的人民很害怕谈论那次事件。,His brother Yacobus echoed the view that people in Paniai are fearful of discussing the incident.
6936,他说他在帮助埋葬四名受害者之后被军方打了。,He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
6937,他说“埋了尸体之后，军方来找我。”,"""After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me,"" he says."
6938,枪击并未停止。,The shootings haven't stopped.
6939,星期二，印尼警方在帕尼艾邻县德亚伊县枪击村民。,"On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai regency."
6940,一名建筑公司经理拒绝帮助运送一名昏迷男子去医院，双方发生冲突，一人死亡，另 17 人受伤，其中还有儿童。,"One person died and 17 others were wounded, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital."
6941,24 岁的男子拉维亚努斯·多伍在附近河边钓鱼时溺水，在去医院的路上死亡。,"The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw who drowned while he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital."
6942,愤怒的村民在该公司的现场办公室前抗议。,Incensed villagers protested in front of the company's site office.
6943,警方称村民向警察扔石头，所以警察开枪警告。,"Police said the villagers threw rocks at officers, who responded by firing warning shots."
6944,但是防暴机动部队（印尼准军事警察）开始向人群开枪，一人被杀。,"But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one."
6945,29 岁的多明谷·巴迪告诉《时代》杂志称，“我们当时都慌了，现在很害怕他们会报复。”他住在医院附近，当时目睹了伤员被急忙送进医院。,"""We were so panicked, we are afraid there will be revenge,"" 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being hurried in, tells TIME."
6946,“我在家躲了两天。”,"""I have been hiding in my house for two days."""
6947,德亚伊议会已经呼吁将涉事警察绳之以法，并将防暴机动部队撤离该地区。,The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
6948,帕尼艾对印尼政府来说一直是一个是非之地。,Paniai has always been a troublespot for the Indonesian government.
6949,有效发展的缺失滋长了 Mee、Moni、Dani 和 Damal 部落人民的不满，这些部落分散在帕尼艾葱郁的中央高地。,"The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal peoples, who live sprawled across Papua's verdant central highlands."
6950,很多人加入了自由巴布亚运动 (OPM)，该组织是一支反叛军队，声称要通过分散袭击和突袭绑架印尼士兵来保护巴布亚人的权利。,"Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers."
6951,部分自由巴布亚运动高层领导出生于帕尼艾，包括塔迪尤斯·尤吉和丹尼尔·尤达斯·柯高亚。,"Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya."
6952,因此，近几年数千帕尼艾人被军方打着“维护国家主权”的幌子逮捕，并故意拘留。,"In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years, under the guise of ""safeguarding national sovereignty."""
6953,有些人再未出现过。,Some never reappear.
6954,在巴布亚人眼里，帕尼艾就是一个“被遗忘的悲剧之地”。,"Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as ""a tragic, forgotten place."""
6955,贫穷滋长了不满。,Poverty feeds the discontent.
6956,埃纳罗塔利在售的大米少得可怜，当地人根本买不起。,The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.

6958,这里的人种植他们能吃的一切：主要是红薯和一些水果和叶子蔬菜。,People here grow everything they eat: mainly nota plus some fruit and leafy vegetables.
6959,耕种是女人的工作，每一位女性都能照料四块或五块红薯地。,"Farming is the job of the women, who each can maintain four or five fields of the sweet potato."
6960,他们通常将大部分收成留作家用，剩余的放到当地市场上卖。,"They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, with the rest sold in the local market."
6961,十块红薯只值 1 万印尼卢比（75 美分）。,"Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents)."
6962,随着时间的推移，经济不平等已经在当地巴布亚人和新移民中拉开，自从往那比雷机场的新路线开放以来这些移民的人数就大大增加了。,"Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papuans and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of a new air routes to Nabire Airport."

6966,巴布亚与世隔绝。,Isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.
6967,此外国际媒体报道的限制依然很紧。,"In addition, reporting restrictions for international media remain tight."
6968,今年早些时候，法国记者弗兰克·埃斯库迪和巴塞尔·隆尚被驱逐出巴布亚，因为他们“不与相关机构配合”，即使他们已经罕见地拿到了拍摄授权。,"Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for a ""lack of coordination with related institutions"" despite having been granted rare permission to film."
6969,据人权观察组织亚洲副局长费利姆·凯恩称，佐科维撤销报道限制以促进透明化和发展的选举誓言并没有实现。,"According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign pledges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized."
6970,他在一次声明中称“如果外国记者试图报道印尼最东部的不满省份巴布亚和西巴布亚，他们是有新风险的：拒绝签证和拉入黑名单。”,"""There are new hazards for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's restive easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and blacklisting,"" he said in a statement."
6971,没有媒体监督意味着国际上对印尼政府的压力基本上只局限于巴布亚的邻国。,The lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indonesian government has been largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.
6972,3 月份，6 个太平洋国家——汤加、瑙鲁、帕劳、图瓦卢、马绍尔群岛、所罗门群岛——要求联合国人权理事会调查巴布亚“各类普遍的人权侵犯事件”，包括帕尼艾枪击案。,"In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the U.N.

6974,印尼外交部发言人阿尔曼纳塔·纳西尔对该群体的指控满不在乎，他告诉雅加达的记者说，“印尼仍在实行民主体制，而且媒体自由，因此人权侵犯案的证据是很难被掩盖的。”,"Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir shrugged off the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta, ""In Indonesia, a democratic system still applies and there's free media so it's hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up."""
6975,当地人希望更多外国政府重视。,Local people want more foreign governments to take note.
6976,据一位知情人士透露，5 月 4 日，荷兰人权大使凯斯·万·巴尔带领官员代表团访问查亚普拉时，当地人民打破了沉默，哀求道“我们想要自由。”他也参加了那次会议，但要求匿名。,"When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the nation's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence, beseeching, ""We want freedom,"" according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay anonymous."

6979,他想让佐科维知道帕尼艾人民不仅生活在贪婪的军队的威胁之下，而且一无所有，这个地区教育寥寥，公共医疗保健服务匮乏。,"He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, aside from living under the looming threat of a rapacious military, wallow in destitution, with paltry education and health services."
6980,戈拜说帕尼艾人民像其他巴布亚人一样认为他们投给佐科维的选票是他必须偿还的债务。,"Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote to Jokowi as a ""debt"" he must repay."

6982,即使在威胁与恐吓之下，帕尼艾枪击案受害者的家属依然作出了他们最后一次象征性的反抗：将一具受害者尸体埋在那个军事警察岗哨的对面。,"Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: burying one victim's body on land just opposite the police and military station."
6983,他们知道正义也许永远不会到来，但至少他们不会让那些罪魁祸首忘记他们的罪行。,"Knowing that justice may never be served, at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes."

6996,周五，迪拜一座世界最高的住宅大楼发生火灾，迫使数百名居民逃离这座高 337 米，79 层的超高层建筑。,"A fire ripped through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of occupants to flee the 337 metre-tall, 79-storey structure."

7008,韩国舆论期待这一久违的朝韩会谈，能为平昌冬奥会倒计时一个月带来一颗“彩蛋”。,Public opinion in South Korea hope that this long-waited North-South Dialog would lead to an “Easter egg” (nice surprise) for the countdown to the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games.
7009,去年11月1日，平昌冬奥会圣火抵达韩国。,The Winter Olympic torch arrived in South Korea on November 1 last year.
7010,圣火掀起的热潮直接反映在了平昌冬奥会的门票销售上。,The fervor stirred up by the Olympic torch is directly reflected on the sale of admission tickets for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics.
7011,就在两个多月前，平昌冬奥会门票销售率还只徘徊在３２％，冬残奥会门票销售率更是只有４.３％，低迷的门票销售率一度令外界对平昌冬奥会的人气倍感担忧。,"A little over two months ago, the proportion of tickets sold lingered at 32% for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics, and a mere 4.3% for the Winter Paralympics. The sluggish ticket sales caused concern among the outside world about the popularity of the PyeongChang Winter Olympics at one point."
7012,但正如平昌冬奥会组委会主席李熙范不久前对记者预测的那样，“随着冬奥会圣火在韩国各地传递，冬奥会的热度日益高涨，相信门票销售状况很快就会好转”。,"However, just as the Chairman of the PyeongChang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic &amp; Paralympic Winter Games, Lee Hee-Beom predicted, “As the Winter Olympic torch is carried and passed on across South Korea, interest in the Winter Olympics will rise. I believe that ticket sales will turn around very quickly”."
7013,据韩国媒体报道，截至1月3日，平昌冬奥会门票销售已达到64%，冬残奥会门票销售率也突破了50%。,"South Korean media reported that as of January 3, the proportion of tickets sold for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics has reached 64%, and that for the Paralympics has also exceeded 50%."

7016,一项针对飞机乘客的调查发现，超过 20% 的乘客曾故意或非故意夹带非法物品通过美国运输安全管理局检查站登机，其中至少有 6% 的乘客非故意携带违禁刀具或其他带刃物登机。,"A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 per cent had knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past the US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints onto the aircraft, including at least 6 per cent who boarded the plane while unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects."
7017,不足 1% 的乘客宣称他们事后才发现误带枪支、弹药或爆炸物旅行。,"Less than 1 per cent claimed that they discovered belatedly that they had mistakenly travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives."

7019,承认曾试图故意携带 TSA 违禁物品登机的回答者中，有 19.7% 为千禧世代，相比之下 X 世代人群不足 15%。,"Of the respondents who admitted knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Generation X."
7020,最常见的故意溜过 TSA 安检人员的物品是食品和饮料。,The most common items whisked past TSA agents on purpose were food and liquids.
7021,超过 3% 的人承认曾故意携带带刃物过安检，而 2.2% 的女性回答者和 3.7% 的男性回答者也表示曾故意携带违禁药物登机。,"More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying bladed items past security, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also acknowledged intentionally carrying prohibited drugs onto the aircraft."
7022,该公司称此次调查全国旅行者是为了了解意外携带和故意携带禁运品过飞机安检登机的人数。,The company said it surveyed travellers around the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done so on purpose.
7023,并不意外的是最可能携带禁运品过安检的人——故意或非故意——是那些飞得最频繁的人。,It's no surprise that the people most likely to haul contraband past security - knowingly or unknowingly - were those who fly the most.
7024,然而，该公司指出 TSA 指南有点复杂难懂。,"As the company points out, however, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing."
7025,人们通常不确定可以携带何种以及多少液体。,People are often uncertain of what liquids they can carry or how much of them.
7026,因此 TSA 缴获最多的正好是违禁液体也就不奇怪了。,So it's no surprise that the largest amount of stuff seized by the TSA happens to be forbidden liquids.
7027,人们曾一度认为 TSA 可能将书本也当成了禁运品。,"For a time, people thought the TSA might be treating books as contraband."
7028,国内航班允许携带液体，但国际航班则不允许携带。,"Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones."
7029,美国环保局局长普鲁特对奥巴马时代的减排条例改变主意,EPA Chief Pruitt Backtracks on Delaying Obama-Era Rules to Reduce Emissions
7030,在被 15 个州起诉一天后，环境保护局局长斯科特·普鲁特改变了他早先推迟实施奥巴马时代减少烟雾空气污染物排放规定的决定。,"One day after getting sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules reducing emissions of smog-causing air pollutants."
7031,普鲁特提出作出这个改变，因为相比以前的政府，环境保护局能够针对环境监管州立机构的需求作出更快速的反应。,Pruitt presented the change as his agency being more responsive than past administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.
7032,他没有提及联邦上诉法院针对他的前任职位提起的法律挑战。,He made no mention of the legal challenge filed against his prior position in a federal appeals court.
7033,争议的焦点是设置 10 月 1 日为各州开始实现 2015 年地面臭氧标准的最后期限。,At issue is an Oct. 1 deadline for states to begin meeting 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
7034,6 月份，普鲁特宣布他将延迟履约一年，以便让环境保护局有更多时间研究该计划，避免“干扰当地决策或阻碍经济增长”。,"Pruitt announced in June he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid ""interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth."""
7035,在被唐纳德·特朗普总统任命之前，普鲁特是俄克拉何马州总检察长，长期以来反对环境法规的严格化。,"Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's state attorney general prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations."
7036,自从抵达华盛顿以来，普鲁特一再转而阻止或推迟化学和化石燃料行业反对的法规。,"Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil-fuel industries."
7037,周三的突然反转是普鲁特监管转返议程上一项最新的法律障碍。,Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
7038,上月，华盛顿联邦上诉法院裁定环境保护局局长越权，试图推迟执行奥巴马政府要求石油和天然气公司监控和减少甲烷泄漏的规定。,"Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks."
7039,在周三晚上发布的一份声明中，普鲁特提出他对于臭氧标准的态度大转弯，表示要加强环境保护局的承诺，与各州展开合作，采取复杂的程序达成新标准。,"In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested his about-face on ozone standards simply reinforced the EPA's commitment to working with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time."
7040,普鲁特表示，“在以前的政府管理下，环保局通常达不到指定的期限，然后等激进团体和其他人士起诉，再同意通过协议确定指定时间表。”他在以前的工作中对环境保护局发起十几次起诉。,"""Under previous administrations, EPA would often fail to meet designation deadlines, and then wait to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing in a settlement to set schedules for designation,"" said Pruitt, who sued EPA more than a dozen times in his prior job."
7041,“我们不相信通过诉讼进行的监管，我们认真对待最后期限。,"""We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously."
7042,我们也认真对待法规和当局。”,"We also take the statute and the authority it gives us seriously."""
7043,尽管如此，环保局的声明表示，普鲁特可能再次使用他的“延期授权和所有其他合法可用的授权”来确保各项规定符合“良好的政策和可用的最佳信息”。,"Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt may at some point once again use his ""delay authority and all other authority legally available"" to ensure regulations ""are founded on sound policy and the best available information."""
7044,国会中的共和党人正在推动大范围改写臭氧层条例。,Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.
7045,上月批准的众议院法案旨在使 2015 年规则推迟至少八年实施。,A House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.
7046,这项措施尚未在参议院投票。,The measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the Senate.

7048,施耐德曼说：“美国环保局的反转 – 在我们提起诉讼之后 - 对于 670 万纽约人的健康和安全来说是具有重要意义的胜利，有超过 1.15 亿美国人的社区直接受到烟雾排放的影响。”,"""The EPA's reversal - following our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers, and the over 115 million Americans directly impacted by smog pouring into their communities,"" Schneiderman said."
7049,加利福尼亚州、康涅狄格州、特拉华州、伊利诺伊州、爱荷华州、缅因州、马萨诸塞州、明尼苏达州、新墨西哥州、俄勒冈州、宾夕法尼亚州、罗德岛州、佛蒙特州和华盛顿州以及哥伦比亚特区都加入纽约州的行列，参与到这个案件当中。,"New York was joined in the case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia."
7050,地面臭氧是汽车、发电厂、炼油厂、化工厂和其他来源排放的常见污染物在大气中阳光照射下产生反应而形成的。,"Ground-level ozone is created when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight."
7051,由此产生的烟雾会给敏感人群造成严重的呼吸问题，每年造成数千人过早死亡。,"The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems among sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year."
7052,当然，公共健康倡导者和环保人士为普鲁特令人惊讶的转变感到欢呼。,Public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising change of course.
7053,生物多样性中心的洛里·安·伯德表示：“令人感到不安的是，这个常识性措施遭到来自保护我们呼吸所需空气的部门负责人的巨大压力。”,"""It's disturbing how much pressure it took to get this commonsense step from the guy in charge of protecting the air we breathe,"" said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity."
7054,“我们必须与特朗普政府为迎合污染者和特殊利益群体的思想运动斗争到底。”,"""We've got to keep fighting the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and special interests."""
7055,除了钢价回暖的外部因素，企业也在降低成本的路上艰难行进。,"In addition to the external factor of rebounding steel prices, enterprises are also forging arduously ahead on the path of lowering costs."

7062,自2009年下半年以来，萧山花木销售量（额）一直保持较高态势，特别是今春，萧山苗木销售再创历史新高，销量大增、价格大涨，据统计，今年1至6月萧山区实现苗木销售收入比去年同期增长48%，增长幅度之大为近20年之最。,"Since the second half of 2009, sales (volume) of Xiaoshan’s flowering trees and shrubs have remained relatively buoyant. This Spring in particular, sales of Xiaoshan’s seedlings recorded a historic high. Sales volume grew significantly and prices jumped. Statistics revealed that for the first six months of the year, the sales revenue of seedlings in the Xiaoshan District increased by 48% year-on-year, and the magnitude of the growth rate was the biggest in nearly 20 years."

7064,近两年萧山花木种植面积扩大了3万亩，总面积达到了18万亩；同时积极向区外发展，萧山苗农在全国各地建立花木基地达到8万亩，比2008年增加了3万亩。,"In the last two years, the planting acreage of Xiaoshan’s flowering trees and shrubs have expanded by 30,000 mu, with total area at 180,000 mu. At the same time, expansion is being actively carried out outside the region. Xiaoshan’s farmers have been setting up flowering tree and shrub bases totaling 80,000 mu across the country, an increase of 30,000 mu from that in 2008."
7065,在种植面积扩大的同时，苗木质量也不断提高，苗圃圃存价值不断提升，大规格、高品质的苗木留存较多，部分苗木出现惜售现象。,"While expanding planting acreage, the quality of the seedlings have also continued to improve; the existing value of the nurseries has been rising. More large specimen and high quality seedlings have been preserved, and sellers have been reluctant to sell some seedlings."
7066,施海勇还提醒，面对目前产销两旺的繁荣景象，生产者应该冷静面对、客观分析，既要看到社会对花木的需求将是长期、不断增加的，同时也要认识到市场竞争将更加激烈。,"Shi Haiyong also said that confronted with the current buoyant peak production and sales period, producers should calmly face and objectively analyze the situation, and take into consideration that the demand for flowering trees and shrubs is long term and will continue to increase.

7068,该公司之前也曾用同样的专利起诉过华硕、联想、三星、索尼和东芝。,"The company had previously used the same patent to sue Asus, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba."
7069,"该诉讼称，iPhone 6s和与之类似的苹果设备均侵犯了7,657,386号美国专利，该专利名称为《综合电池服务系统》。","The lawsuit claimed that iPhone 6s and Apple equipment similar to it have violated US Patent No. 7,657,386, which is known as “Integrated battery service system”."
7070,原告希望获得现金赔偿，或者针对判决宣布后的侵权设备收取专利费。,The plaintiff is seeking monetary damages or royalties on the infringing equipment upon announcement of the verdict.
7071,从起诉书判断，原告似乎认为iPhone的快充功能侵犯了该公司的专利。,"According to the indictment, the plaintiff appears to believe that iPhone’s fast-charging technology jas violated the former’s patent."
7072,具备快充功能的iPhone会快速将电量充到80%，之后再进行涓流充电。,"iPhone’s fast-charging function charges the battery quickly until to 80% of its capacity, then switches to slower trickle charging."
7073,Somaltus其实是一家所谓的“专利流氓”，因为该公司并不提供明显的产品和服务，而且在网上很难查找到相关信息。,"Somaltus is actually a so-called “patent troll” because the company does not provide any apparent product or service, and it is hard to find any information on the company online."
7074,然而，他们已经成功就这项专利与福特和日产等汽车厂商达成了庭外和解。,"However, it has successfully reached out-of-court settlement with auto makers such as Ford and Nissan with this patent."
7075,会议认为，加快信息化发展，促进资源互联集成、高效利用，提升产业数字化、智能化水平，对推动“中国制造2025”和大众创业、万众创新，培育新动能，提高群众生活品质，意义重大。,"The meeting believed that accelerating information development; promoting interconnection and integration, as well as efficient utilization of resources; and enhancing the level of digitization and intelligence in industry would have great significance for advancing “Made in China 2025”; entrepreneurship and innovation by the masses; developing new drivers; and raising the standard of living for the masses."
7076,由董子健主演的台湾热血青春片《六弄咖啡馆》是本届电影节传媒大奖竞赛片，另一部由他主演的华语片《德兰》更入围主竞赛单元争夺金爵奖。,"“At Café 6”, a Taiwanese movie about the relationship of a group of youths, starring Dong Zijian, is a film competing for the current film festival’s media award. “De Lan”, another movie in which he is the leading actor, has also been shortlisted for the Golden Goblet Award."
7077,今年23岁的他，身穿迷彩T恤、黑色运动裤，一身青春阳光。因为采访间的椅子不够，他就直接坐在了地上，说：“来吧，就这样聊挺好的。”,"The 23-year-old, dressed in a camouflage T-shirt and black sweat pants, looked young and radiant. As there were not enough chairs in the interview room, he sat on the floor and said, “Let’s start. Chatting like this isn’t half bad.”"
7078,据此前透露，铁路部门对12306网站进行扩容改造，春运购票期间推出新服务，近六成车票不再需要使用验证码。,"It was earlier revealed that the railway department would enhance the capacity of and remodel the 12306 website, and launch new services during the Spring Festival transportation ticket purchase period.

7084,他与澳大利亚总理马尔科姆·特恩布尔之间的通话记录也被公布，该记录显示出他们之间紧张的交流。,Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published revealing a tense exchange.
7085,特朗普告诉特恩布尔，美国承担难民遣送至澳大利亚的交易是“荒谬的”，“令人讨厌的”和“愚蠢的”，他曾建议美国禁止难民重新安置，而现在坚持奥巴马政府斡旋下的交易，这将使他看起来像是一个“傻瓜”。,"Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull a deal for the US to take on refugees headed for Australia was ""ridiculous,"" ""rotten"" and ""stupid,"" insisting the deal, brokered under the Obama administration, would make him look like ""a dope"" after he had proposed a ban on refugee resettlement in the US."

7089,郭颂曾创作、演唱了《新货郎》、《乌苏里船歌》、《我爱这些年轻人》、《甜透了咱心窝》等50余首作品。,"Guo Song wrote and sang more than 50 works including “The New Goods Deliveryman”, “Wusuli Boat Song”, “I Love These Young People”, and “Heartwarming”."

7102,摩尔滩惨案：活动者再现种族主义私刑，伸张正义,Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reenact Racist Lynching as a Call for Justice
7103,一辆 1948 年的福特水星汽车穿过佐治亚州门罗小镇的一群围观者，朝着小小的摩尔滩桥隆隆奔行。,"A 1948 Ford Mercury passed through a group of onlookers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward the small Moore's Ford Bridge."
7104,车上载有四名黑人乘客和一名白人司机，在车抵达这座桥之前，一群带枪的白人走向前，堵住了汽车前进的路。,"Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block its path."
7105,这帮暴徒的头儿 - 一名穿着细条纹西装的中年男子 – 深吸一口雪茄，眼睛瞥进挡风玻璃。,The leader of the mob - a middle aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a long drag on his cigar and peered through the windshield.
7106,车内乘客充满恐惧。,"Inside, the occupants reeled in fear."
7107,“我们想要 - 罗杰！” 那人喊道。,"""We want that n----r Roger!"" the man barked."
7108,“把他从车里拖出来！”,"""Get him out of the car!"""
7109,一名年轻的黑人从前排乘客座位上被拖下来，尖叫声刺破沉默。,Screams ripped through the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.
7110,幸运的是，7 月 22 日这个可怕的场面只是一场重演。,"Fortunately, this horrific scene, which played out on July 22, is just a reenactment."
7111,但是，当“罗杰”的脖子上套上套索时，几乎所有围观的观众都发出了真切的喘息声。,"But when a noose is thrown around the neck of ""Roger,"" nearly everyone in the audience let out very real gasps."
7112,自 2005 年以来，民权活动者重返摩尔滩桥，再现两对黑人夫妇 - 罗杰和多萝西·马尔康以及乔治和梅雷·多西 - 1946 年被三 K 党私刑绞死那天晚上的场景。,"Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to recreate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946."
7113,从未有人被指控谋杀。,No one has ever been charged with the murders.
7114,“虽然我们知道他们是谁，尽管我们在社区中看到过他们，但这些年来，他们没有一个人遭发逮捕，这着实令人难以置信，”帮助组织这次重演的蒂龙·布鲁克斯说道。,"""It's mind boggling that all of these years, not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities; even though we know who they are,"" said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reenactment."
7115,“这是历史的污点，是我们灵魂的负担。”,"""It's a stain on a history, but it's a burden on our souls."""
7116,布鲁克斯 71 岁，是一位佐治亚州前议员和终身维权活动家。,Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.
7117,对他而言，重演是一场引人注目的号召行动，每年提醒门罗社区的人们，不公正从未得到纠正。,"For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected."
7118,“我们想起诉，我们要结案，我们要治愈，我们希望和解，但我们必须首先得到正义，”他说。,"""We want prosecution, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but we have to have justice first,"" he said."
7119,“除非我们得到正义，否则我们就得不到治愈及和解。”,"""We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."""
7120,1946 年 7 月 27 日，验尸官在一名摩尔滩私刑受害者的尸体上盖上床单。,"A coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore's Ford lynching on July 27, 1946."
7121,根据美国全国广播公司新闻获得的联邦调查局档案，来自门罗和周边各县的 50 多名男子涉嫌参与私刑。,"According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching."
7122,但他们中没有一人被起诉过。,But not one was ever prosecuted.
7123,虽然嫌疑人数十年来一直处于逍遥法外的状态，但民权活动者表示，实施私刑的双重动机在整个城镇都是众所周知的：政治和性。,"Though the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the twin motivations for the lynchings were always well known throughout town: politics and sex."
7124,1946 年 4 月，最高法院的一项裁决使佐治亚州的黑人公民得以在当年夏天晚些时候首次在初选中进行投票。,"In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens in Georgia to cast ballots for the first time during the primary race later that summer."
7125,根据联邦调查局的统计，大约在同一时间，黑人佃农罗杰·马尔科姆在一场斗争中刺杀了白人地主巴内特·赫斯特 - 看起来像是为了一个女人。,"Around the same time of the election, according to the FBI, black sharecropper Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, during a fight - ostensibly over a woman."
7126,布鲁克斯说，镇上的传言是赫斯特睡了马尔科姆的妻子多萝西，她的宝宝也不是她丈夫的。,"Brooks said the town rumor was that Hester had been sleeping with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's."
7127,联邦调查局称，1946 年 7 月 25 日，地位显赫的白人地主洛伊·哈里森花了 600 美元将马尔科姆保释出狱。,"On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to bail Malcom out of jail, according to the FBI."
7128,多萝西和堂兄妹麦·美瑞和乔治·多尔西陪他到监狱。,"He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy, and their cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey."
7129,但是，当他们从监狱回来，快到摩尔滩桥时，一群私刑暴徒把车围了起来。,"But, driving away from the jail, as they approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car."
7130,“事实证明，是哈里森组织并命令执行了这场谋杀，”一份 FBI 报告得出了这样的结论。,"""As it turns out it was Harrison who set up and ordered the murders,"" one FBI report concludes."
7131,“很明显，州和地方执法部门之间存在阴谋，他们不仅参与了谋杀，毁灭了证据，还隐瞒了证人的身份。”,"""It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy among state and local law enforcement, who not only took part in the murders, disposed of evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."""
7132,布鲁克斯十分简明扼要。,Brooks put it more succinctly.
7133,他表示，“这是一场投票权惨案。”,"""It was a voting rights massacre,"" he said."
7134,“他们惨遭杀害，是凶手向这个社区的黑人发出信息：‘如果你注册并投票，你也将遭遇同样的结局。'”,"""They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, this is what will happen to you.'"""
7135,近十年来，卡桑德拉·格林一直负责主导摩尔滩桥私刑惨案的年度重演工作。,"For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge lynchings."
7136,她的表现手法形象鲜明，扣人心弦，带有一种深刻的种族主义背景。许多人都希望这种种族主义在美国已不复存在。,"Her performance is graphic, gripping and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America."
7137,看很难，不看更难，但格林说这就是关键所在。,"It's difficult to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point."
7138,“我们不想谈论私刑，因为私刑使我们要面对所有人的丑陋面，”她说。,"""We don't want to talk about the lynching because it makes us face the ugliness in all of us,"" she said."
7139,“但是，如果你不听我说话，或者不听到我讲述自己的经历，我就不能和你建立关系。”,"""But I can't build a relationship with you, if you won't hear me, or hear what I've been through."""
7140,今年的演出于六月开始，第一天有将近 30 名演员 - 十几位白人，其余为黑人 - 挤在一间屋子里，听取格林发布排练好的演出概览。,"Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched into a well-rehearsed overview of the play."
7141,韦德·马尔鲍担任格林的联合导演。,Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's co-director.
7142,多年来，他一直扮演着三 K 党的角色，但他说这个角色从不轻松。,"He's played the part of the head Klansman for years, but he said the role never gets any easier."
7143,“我感觉很肮脏，因为我不是这样的人，” 马尔鲍说。,"""I feel dirty because this is not who I am,"" said Marbaugh."
7144,“但我认为保持这段历史的鲜活度非常重要，因为我们不想再回到那个时代。”,"""But I think it's very important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to those times."""
7145,房间里，扮演罗杰·马尔科姆和巴内特·赫斯特的演员达里奥斯·布拉德肖和尼克·拉斯科纳在排练他们的台词。,"Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines."
7146,这场戏开始时，马尔科姆大喊大叫并推开赫斯特，对他睡了自己的妻子多萝西感到气愤不已。,"The play begins with Malcom shouting and shoving Hester, livid that he's been sleeping with his wife, Dorothy."
7147,“我说啊，滚出我的地盘！”,"""I said n---a, get off my property!"""
7148,拉斯科纳回击道。,Rascona fires back.
7149,接着他们就打了起来。,There's a beat.
7150,然后每个人（至少所有的黑人演员）爆发出了笑声。,And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts into laughter.
7151,格林笑得最厉害。,Greene laughs the hardest.
7152,“怎么了？！，”拉斯科纳问道。,"""What?!,"" Rascona asked."
7153,他感到惊慌、困惑。,"He's alarmed, confused."
7154,我演得太过了吗？,Did I go too hard?
7155,“没有，”格林笑着说。,"""No,"" Greene said through chuckles."
7156,“我只是认为白人回击的时候不会说‘啊 '。”,"""I just don't think white people back then said 'n---a.'"""
7157,“是的，”另外一名黑人演员打趣道。,"""Yea,"" one of the other black cast members quipped."
7158,“你的语气必须强硬。”,"""You have to hit the hard 'R.'"""
7159,就这样，房间里的能量发生了变化；友爱的感觉驱走了不适感。,And just like that the energy in the room shifts; a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
7160,每个人都努力这样做，不仅是为了表演这场戏，也是为了纪念四名遇难者。,"Everyone is dedicated to getting this right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed."
7161,现场再次开始。,The scene begins again.
7162,这一次，拉斯科纳说这个“啊”字时，语气尖锐而有力。,"This time, when Rascona says the N-word, it's sharp and emphatic."
7163,没有一个人笑场。,Absolutely no one laughs.
7164,重演有力而迅速地结束了。,The reenactment ends violently and quickly.
7165,尖叫声、枪声大作，然后，就是一片沉默。,"There's screams, gunfire and then, silence."
7166,一位穿着葬礼黑衣的女子站在演员身体边，唱着比利·哈乐黛的哀悼词“奇怪的果实”。,"A woman dressed in funeral black, stands over the actors bodies and performs Billie Holiday's mournful eulogy, ""Strange Fruit."""
7167,她的声音压过了其他言语。,Her voice breaks on every other word.
7168,一百码之外，大约四十名观众在不停地擦拭着汗水和眼泪。,"A hundred yards back, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears away from their eyes."
7169,观众中黑人和白人几乎各占一半。,The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.
7170,有一对夫妇专程从纽约伊萨卡来看演出，还有很多人就住在马路附近。,"One couple has traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many are from just down the road."
7171,布鲁克斯带他们去马尔科姆和多萝西的墓地拜祭，路程将近八小时，大家都在忍受着佐治亚令人不适的湿热感。,They've all weathered Georgia's oppressive humidity for the nearly eight hours as Brooks lead them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
7172,直到此时，谋杀者仍然是个迷。但现在，站在发生私刑的同一片土地上，空气中弥漫着焦虑。,"Up until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the lynchings took place, the air feels haunted."
7173,当歌曲最后的音符消失时，格林请人们靠近些检查演员扮演的尸体。,"As the final notes of the song fade, Greene invites the crowd to move closer and inspect the bodies."
7174,孩子们俯身低头，看着假血和尸体，互相窃窃私语。,"Children crouch by their heads, take in the fake blood and still bodies, and whisper to each other."
7175,“他们并不是真的死了，”一个小男孩喃喃自语，好像在提醒自己。,"""They're not really dead,"" one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself."
7176,几分钟后，格林感谢人群，然后表演结束。,"After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd, and suddenly it's over."
7177,演员甩开私刑绳索，擦掉眼泪。,The actors throw off the lynching rope and wipe away tears.
7178,布拉德肖拥抱着扮演三 K 党头目的西装男子马尔鲍。,"Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the head Klansman."
7179,尼克·拉斯科纳拥抱他的两个同僚，在他们怀里失声哭泣；表演中的情感最终感染到他。,"Nick Rascona hugs two of his castmates, and then breaks down crying in their arms; the emotional toll of the performance finally getting to him."
7180,“没关系，”其中一名妇女低语道。,"""It's okay,"" one of the women whispers."
7181,“我们知道你的内心不是这样的。,"""We know that's not what's in your heart."
7182,你这样做是有原因的。”,"You did this for a reason."""
7183,之后，观众坐下来与演员共进晚餐。,"Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors."
7184,在同一张桌子上，来自亚特兰大的一对白人夫妇与他们刚刚遇到的一对黑人夫妇亲密聊天，畅谈关于重演的事情。,"At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chats animatedly about the reenactment with a black couple they just met."
7185,丹尼斯·杜普林斯基很难找到词语形容她观看后感受。,Denise Duplinski struggled to find words for how the performance made her feel.
7186,“很难想象那些可怕的言辞和行为......竟然是像你这样的人说出来、做出来的，因为他们看起来跟你很像，”她说。,"""It's hard to hear those horrible awful words, and deeds ... come out of people that look like you and who do it because they look like you,"" she said."
7187,“这对我来说，真的让我以为私刑仍在进行，”她补充道，“现在这种事情只称为警察枪杀。”,"""What this really does to me is make me think that lynchings are still going on,"" she added, ""they're just called police shootings now."""
7188,房间里，蒂龙·布鲁克斯坐在桌子旁观看，品尝和回味着公民权利。,"Across the room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eating and reminiscing about civil rights."
7189,他说他已经开始计划明年的表演了。,He said he's already begun planning for next year's performance.
7190,“重演是一种鼓舞人心的方式，因为它描述了我们经历过的恐怖，但它也是十分具有教育性，”他说道。,"""The reenactment is inspirational in a way because it describes the horror of what we endured, but it also is a teaching moment,"" he said."
7191,“如果你不从中吸取教训，这种事情可能还会再次发生。,"""It's like, if you don't learn from this, it can happen again."
7192,那些不研究、不了解自己历史的人注定要重蹈覆辙。”,"Those who don't study their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."""
7193,对于天然气市场化改革而言，“管网独立”方面的改革重要性不言而喻，但阻力和争议也较大。,"As regards implementing market-oriented reforms associated with natural gas, the importance of reform with respect to “pipeline and grid independence” is self-evident, but more resistance and controversy can be expected."
7194,记者7日从河北开滦集团获悉，7日上午11时25分，位于河北省唐山市古冶区的开滦集团化工有限公司乳化车间发生爆炸事故，现场有13名作业人员被困。,"On the 7th, reporters learned from Kailuan (Group) that at 11:25 am on the 7th, an explosion occurred at the emulsifying workshop of Kailuan (Group) Chemical Co., Ltd. which is located at Guye District of Tangshan, Hebei Province; 13 operators were trapped at the site of the explosion."

7200,不过歌迷们对此并没有表示任何不满，反而齐齐送上祝福，因为失约的原因是周杰伦幸福地当上了爸爸。,"His fans did not protest however; instead, they sent their blessings because the reason Jay Chou failed to release a new album was because he became a father."
7201,让大家等待了整整一年半之后，昨天周杰伦终于来到北京，为人们献上这张他升级人父后的首份作品，同时也是他音乐生涯中的第14张专辑《周杰伦的睡前故事》。,"After waiting for a year and a half, Jay Chou finally arrived in Beijing to present his first works since becoming a father. It was also the 14th album in his music career, “Jay Chou’s Bedtime Stories”."
7202,美媒：中国空军工程大学科学家研究激光卫星，用于清除太空垃圾,US media: Scientists from the Air Force Engineering University of China looking into laser satellite to clean up space debris
7203,参考消息网1月18日报道 美媒称，中国科学家提出了一项大胆创新的提议，使用大型激光器清理杂乱的地球轨道，毁掉旧卫星以及其天空垃圾。,"Reference News January 18 report US media claims that Chinese scientists have put forward a daring and innovation proposal - to use large lasers to clean up the messy Earth orbit, and destroy old satellites as well as other space debris."
7204,据美国《新闻周刊》网站1月15日报道，中国空军工程大学的研究人员撰写了一篇题为《天基激光清除小尺度空间碎片变轨模型研究》的论文，该论文描述了通过使用天基平台激光器，空间碎片可以如何被激光辐照成更小的、危害没那么大的碎片。,"A January 15 report on US “Newsweek” website stated that researchers at the Air Force Engineering University of China have written a thesis on “Research on de-orbiting model of small scale space debris removal using space-based laser”. This thesis described how by using space-based platform lasers, space debris would be rendered smaller and less dangerous as a result of laser radiation."
7205,报道称，多年来，太空垃圾一直都是国际空间机构关心的问题，美国航天局考虑了多种选择方案跟踪、探测和移除人造碎片。,"The report claimed that for years, space debris has always been a matter of concern for international space agencies. NASA has considered many alternative plans to track, probe and remove human made debris."
7206,清除大尺度空间碎片的方式包括用来清扫和收集废物的巨型网，以及可以被用来将它们吸出轨道的磁体。中国科学家进行了激光器仿真研究，得出以下结论，即这将是清理地球轨道的有效方式。,"The methods for cleaning up large space debris include using an enormous net to clean up and collect the debris, as well as using magnetic material to suck them out of the orbit. Chinese scientists have conducted a laser simulation study and arrived at the following conclusion. This will be an effective method for cleaning up the Earth’s orbit."
7207,该论文的摘要称：“（仿真研究）为天基平台激光清除空间碎片技术的应用提供了必要的理论基础。”,The abstract of the thesis claimed that “(the simulated study) has provided the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space debris removal by using space-based laser.”
7208,美国国防业巨头洛克希德－马丁公司2014年的研究发现，对于正在沿轨道运行的卫星而言，每天大约有200个威胁物。,"A 2014 research conducted by US defense industry giant Lockheed Martin revealed that as far as orbiting satellites are concerned, approximately 200 deterrents exist daily."
7209,沿地球轨道运动的高速碎片被视为对未来空间任务的严重威胁，被欧洲航天局的专家形容为“致命的一连串威胁”。过去的每一年，高速碎片都在持续增加。,"The high-speed debris of orbiting satellites are regarded as serious threats to future space missions, and have been described by European Space Agency experts as a “series of fatal threats”. High-speed debris has continued to rise annually over the years."
7210,另据美国《大众机械》月刊网站1月17日报道，太空基本上是空的，但紧挨着地球的太空越来越拥挤。我们送入太空的每颗卫星最终都会变成又一块围绕地球运行的碎片，而且随着时间的推移，这些碎片会堆积起来。,"According to a January 17 report on the US-based “Popular Mechanics” website, space is basically empty, but space around Earth has become increasingly crowded. Every satellite we send into space will ultimately become debris orbiting Earth. As time passes, these debris will accumulate."
7211,碎片越多，某颗仍在正常运转的卫星被碎片击中的几率越高，进而损坏或摧毁一项价值数百万美元的投资。,"As debris increase, the probability of a satellite that is still operating normally being hit by debris becomes higher, thereby damaging or destroying an investment worth millions of US dollars."
7212,报道称，所有太空机构都制定了在未来清除太空垃圾的计划。,The report claimed that all space agencies have formulated plans to remove space debris in the future.
7213,NASA正在考虑用喷射气体降低碎片的速度，使其脱离轨道，欧洲正在考虑发射一颗携带一张大网的卫星，捕捉碎片，带回地球，日本的想法是用一条电动链捕捉碎片。,NASA is considering firing atmospheric gases to reduce the speed of the debris so that it would de-orbit. Europe is looking at launching a satellite with a large net to capture the debris and it back to earth. Japan’s idea is to use a power chain to capture the debris.
7214,眼下，中国也提出一个解决太空垃圾的办法，即用一台大型激光器把漂浮的太空垃圾击成不那么有害的小碎片。,"At this time, China has also put forward a method of solving the space debris problem, and that is, to use a large laser to shrink the floating space debris into smaller, less harmful pieces."
7215,据中国空军工程大学的一群研究人员在德国《光学》月刊上发表的一篇论文，在一颗卫星上安装这样一台激光器将足够有效地清理太空，至少根据模拟结果是这样。,"According to a thesis published in German magazine “Optics”, a group of researchers at the Air Force Engineering University of China claimed that installing such a laser on a satellite would be enough to effectively clean up space; at least, according to the simulated results, that is."
7216,报道称，证实有效性的唯一途径是进行测试，目前尚无此类任务的安排，但或许早晚会有人在卫星上安装激光器然后将其送入太空。,"The report claimed that the only way to prove effectiveness is to carry out tests. Currently, there are no arrangements for such as mission, but sooner or later, someone will install a laser on a satellite and send it into space."
7217,一旦做到了，我们就可以最终开始一劳永逸地消除太空垃圾的问题。,"Once this is achieved, we can finally bid farewell to space debris problems for good."

7311,今年的剧情类“视帝”“视后”竞争激烈，最终由两位新人打败了一众老演员：最佳男主角奖由首次提名的《黑客军团》男主角拉米·马雷克夺得，最佳女主角奖由《黑色孤儿》的塔提阿娜·玛斯拉尼夺得。,"Competition for “Best Actor” and “Best Actress” in a dramatic role was intense this year.

7318,国际在线消息（记者刘湃）：18日，意大利驻华使馆经济商务处举办中国－意大利环保洽谈会，来自两国企业和科研机构人士就新形势下两国在可再生资源领域的合作广泛交换意见，达成积极共识。,"CRI Online (Liu Pai): The Economic &amp; Commercial Section of the Embassy of the Republic of Italy in China held a Sino-Italian Cooperation Program for Environmental Protection on the 18th. Participants from corporations and scientific research institutions of the two countries had an extensive exchange of views in respect of cooperation between the two countries as regards renewable resources under a new state of affairs, and reached a consensus."

It also looked forward to promoting its environmental protection partnership experience with China in other regions around the world."
7321,瑞典避难者年龄评估测试最新结果公布,New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests released
7322,瑞典避难者测试采用最新方法，从医学上评估他们的年龄，最新结果表明，超过 80% 的受试者被判定为超过 18 岁，但并非所有人都相信其准确性。,"The latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method of medically assessing their age show that over 80 percent tested were judged to be older than 18, but not everyone has faith in their accuracy."
7323,瑞典国家法医学中心 (R?ttsmedicinalverket) 在今年早些时候开始此项测试。,Sweden's national Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests earlier year.
7324,被指未能准确评估部分声称未成年的难民的年龄后，瑞典移民局 (Migrationsverket) 设计了这些测试，以期在避难过程中进行更准确的年龄评估。,They are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claiming to be underage.
7325,到目前为止，瑞典移民局已经送来 6880 例测试者，法医学中心目前已经公布 2017 年 3 月中旬至 7 月 31 日期间总计 2481 名测试者的结果。,"To date Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period between mid March until July 31st, 2017."
7326,80%（2002 人）被判定为年满 18 岁或以上，然而在另外 25 例的测试中，瑞典国家法医学中心又判定受试对象“可能年满 18 岁或以上”。,"Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or over, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the subject was ""possibly 18 or over."""
7327,在 432 例测试中，结果是此人“可能未满 18 岁”。,"In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is ""possibly under 18."""
7328,测试只针对年龄有疑问的人。,The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is in question.
7329,据法医学中心的约翰·葛兰森称，这些结果与前几个月的结果一致。,"According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with previous months."
7330,他告诉 The Local：“这些数据和前几个月的数据没有太大差别，数字都十分一致。”,"""We see no big difference in the statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent,"" he told The Local."
7331,被判定年龄达到 18 岁以上的案例占据较高比例并不一定表示这些避难者就谎报了年龄。,The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about their age.
7332,五月份，该中心公布了 581 例测试结果，并称有 442 例“表明此受试者已年满 18 岁或以上”。,"In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 instances that ""suggest the person examined is 18 years or older."""
7333,新闻报纸 Svenska Dagbladet 调查了此次公布的 581 例测试结果，发现其中 243 例受试者已公开表示他们今年会年满 18 岁。,When newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results released however it found that in 243 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year.
7334,对智齿进行 X 射线检查，对关节进行核磁共振扫描，然后由牙科医生和放射科医生分析结果，这种医疗评估方式也在部分地区受到质疑。,"The method of medical age assessment, which consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, then having dentists and radiologists analyse them, has also been criticised in some quarters."
7335,其中一名怀疑者就是卡罗琳学院的内分泌学家克劳德·马库斯，其工作包括评估人们的生物成熟度以判定他们是否早于或晚于正常年龄经历青春期。,"One sceptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual."
7336,他告诉新闻报纸 Metro：“我有理由这样想，而且我认为使用的测量方式不应该是这样的。,"""I've had reason to think about this, and I don't think the type of measurement being used should be."
7337,以这样的方式判定生理年龄很不准确。,Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
7338,如果我们不能保证准确性，就不应该假装我们做得到。”,"If we can't say it for sure we shouldn't pretend that we can,"" he told newspaper Metro."
7339,然而法医学中心的葛兰森却为这些测试的准确性辩护：“大体上可以说判定一个孩子为成年人的不不确定风险很小。”,"The Forensic Medicine Agency's Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests however: ""In general you can say that the risk of inaccurately judging a child to be an adult is small."
7340,最大的风险是此人刚好未满 18 岁，这种情况大约占 10%。,"The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in which case it's around 10 percent."""
7341,西弗吉尼亚州州长宣布换党,West Virginia governor announces he's switching parties
7342,周四晚，西弗吉尼亚州民主党州长吉姆·贾斯提斯 ( Jim Justice) 在特朗普总统的集会上宣布，他将更改党派。,"The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he's switching parties."
7343,“喜欢也好，不喜欢也罢，民主党已经离我而去”，州长法官说道。,"""Like it or not like it, the Democrats walked away from me,"" Gov. Justice said."

7348,特朗普早些时候在西弗吉尼亚州的集会上承诺要作出重大宣布。,Mr. Trump promised earlier a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.

7350,据《福布斯》报道，贾斯提斯在 2016 年被评选为该州唯一的亿万富翁。,"Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016."
7351,《福布斯》指出，他继承了父亲的煤炭产业，在五个州均拥有煤矿。,"Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, having inherited a coal business from his father."
7352,目前，他的身价大约为 15.9 亿美元。,He's worth about $1.59 billion.
7353,与此同时，共和党全国委员会于周四晚间发表声明称：“贾斯提斯州长的换党是对民主党的又一次打击，这非但不会阻碍我们的国家变得再次伟大，反而会使我们的国家再次伟大。”,"Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee released a statement Thursday night saying ""Governor Justice's party switch is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather obstruct than work to make our country great again."""
7354,“民主党目前只有 15 个州长，并且控制州议会的数量创历史最低，贾斯提斯州长的声明是对这样一个从上到下丧失领导力、无法找到积极的统一口号的政党的最新拒绝 ”，共和党全国委员会女主席罗娜?麦克丹尼尔在向 CBS 新闻发表的声明中称。,"""With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message,"" RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News."
7355,方文山坦言，用音乐来讲完整的故事，是自己的梦想。,Fang Wenshan said frankly that using music to tell an entire story is his dream.
7356,一首歌四到五分钟，要完整讲述一个故事很困难。,"A song lasts between four and five minutes, so telling an entire story would be very difficult."
7357,我写歌的时候只有情绪，没有故事线，一直觉得很可惜。,"When I write songs, I am assailed by emotion. There is no story line. I’ve always felt that that was a real pity."
7358,塞巴斯蒂安·科称赞俄罗斯对于兴奋剂丑闻的“坦率”道歉,Coe praises 'candid' Russian apology for doping scandal
7359,周四，国际田径联合会主席塞巴斯蒂安·科对俄罗斯就兴奋剂丑闻道歉表示赞赏，并称该道歉十分“坦诚”，但他重申现在亦不是俄罗斯重新参加这项运动的时刻。,Global athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised what he described as a candid apology from Russia over a doping scandal on Thursday but reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be readmitted to the sport.
7360,俄罗斯田径联合会主席米特里·希拉克丁在世界田径锦标赛前夕举行的国际田联大会上表示，他的国家被禁止参加这项运动是正确的，他决心打击兴奋剂。,"Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told an IAAF Congress, held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping."
7361,他表示他很遗憾“所有在比赛中获得金牌和银牌的运动员都被剥夺了奖牌。”,"He said he was sorry to ""all athletes who have had gold and silver medals snatched from them at competitions."""
7362,尽管他做出如此评论，国际田联大会仍投票赞成维持禁令。此前，世界反兴奋剂机构 (WADA) 的报告中提及发现了俄罗斯国家赞助使用兴奋剂的证据，禁令于 2015 年 11 月实施。,"Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia."
7363,“我认为今天的回应非常坦率，非常坦率的介绍，”国际田联主席科告诉记者。,"""I thought it was a very candid response today, a very candid presentation,"" IAAF president Coe told reporters."

7365,科说，他也很“高兴”俄罗斯接受了重新参赛的标准。,"Coe said he was also ""pleased"" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction."
7366,“我认为这是非常有建设性的一天，也认为我们取得了一些进展，但田联大会支持专案小组的建议，现在还不是恢复俄罗斯参赛资格的时候，”科说。,"""I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress is being made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to reinstate Russia,"" said Coe."
7367,“我们需要在接下来的几个月里尽其所能使这一情况正常化。,"""We need to do everything over the next few months to normalize this situation."
7368,我们的指导原则一直是希望将清白的运动员从受污染的系统中分离出来，”他补充说。,"The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the tainted system,"" he added"
7369,十九名俄罗斯运动员符合国际田联的严格标准，将在周五伦敦举办的世界田径锦标赛中以中立选手的身份参加比赛。,"Nineteen Russian athletes will be competing as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships which start in London on Friday, having met strict IAAF criteria."
7370,国际田联专案小组负责人符恩·安德森周一表示，俄罗斯尚未达到恢复参赛的若干标准。,"The head of the IAAF's Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet several of the criteria for reinstatement."
7371,他在伦敦向国际田联理事会发表演讲后告诉记者，药物检测做的仍然不足，被禁的教练也仍然在执教。,"Drug-testing was still insufficient and banned coaches were still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a presentation to the IAAF Council."
7372,今天上午举行的《北京市控制吸烟条例》实施一周年宣传活动上，“我的控烟宣言”全国青年控烟微视频获奖的青年学生代表与全国控烟宣传形象大使黄轩互动，并且回顾了征集活动视频及获奖优秀作品展映。,"At the promotional event for the first anniversary of the implementation of the “Regulations of Beijing Municipality on Smoking Control” held this morning, young student representatives of the video clip, “My Smoking Control Declaration”, which won the national youth smoking control video clip award, interacted with national smoking control ambassador Huang Xuan, and reviewed the video of the activities concerned with calling for entries for the contest, as well as the screening of the excellent award winning works."
7373,法晚记者从活动上获悉，青年演员黄轩被聘为全国控烟宣传形象大使。,Reporters from The Mirror learned from the event that young actor Huang Xuan was engaged to become the national smoking control ambassador.
7374,黄轩自曝大学时期曾抽烟，在充分认识烟雾危害后，成功戒烟，这次更主动承担了戒烟大使的职责，号召青少年远离烟草。,"Huang Xuan said he used to smoke when he was in university. After having fully understood the dangers of smoke, he stopped smoking successfully. This time, he proactively assumed the duty of a quit-smoking ambassador, calling on youths to stay away from tobacco."
7375,观众戴上面具，成为故事中幽灵一般的存在，这是《不眠之夜》最大的游戏规则。,"Audiences put on masks, and exist like a spirit in the story. This is most critical rule of the game in “Sleep No More”."
7376,人民民币中间价报6.4401贬值66基点 连续升势暂缓,"The RMB middle price is registered at 6.4401, a depreciation of 66 basis points. The rising slows down."
7377,宏观经济 腾讯财经2018-01-18 09:50分享,Macroeconomics Tencent Finance 2018-01-18 09:50
7378,腾讯财经讯1月18日，人民币兑美元中间价报6.4401，上一交易日中间价贬值66个基点，结束了此前的五连涨。,"Tencent Financial News on January 18, the USD-to-RMB middle prices is registered at 6.4401, a depreciation of 66 basis points compared with the last trading day, ending the rise spanning five consecutive days."
7379,隔夜市场，美元回暖，美元指数走出V字形态，截至北京时间07：30报90.8900。,"In the overnight market, the US dollar experienced a V-shaped rebounded, ending at 90.8900 as of 07:30, Beijing time."
7380,美联储公布经济褐皮书显示，12个联储地区几乎都报告2018年初经济活动取得适度到温和的增长，对今年前景保持乐观。,The Beige Book published by Federal Reserve shows that almost all 12 Fed regions reported mild to moderate growth in economic activity in early 2018. The Federal Reserve remains optimistic about the outlook for this year.
7381,同时，美国12月份失业率仍然保持在4.1%，为2000年以来最低，预计企业将未来几个月上涨工资。,"Meanwhile, the U.S. unemployment rate remained at 4.1% in December, the lowest since 2000, and companies are expected to increase wages in the coming months."
7382,美联储官员普遍认为税改是支持这个适度走强经济前景的一个因素，美联储预测2018年经济增长2.5%，加息3次。,Fed officials generally believe that tax reform is a factor supporting this modest strengthening of the economic outlook. The Fed predicts that the economy will increase by 2.5% in 2018 and the interest rate will be raised three times.
7383,市场人士指出，近段时间，欧洲央行货币政策收紧预期推升欧元汇率，美元指数连续下滑，人民币对美元汇率相应出现一波快速拉升行情，不过目前看，欧洲央行不太可能很快调整政策立场，外汇市场短期波动后终究要向基本面回归，人民币汇率继续平稳运行是大概率事件。,"Some market observers have point out that the expected tightening of ECB’s monetary policy pushes up the exchange rate of the Euro in recent days. As a result, the US dollar index declines continuously, and the RMB exchange rate against the US dollar has seen a surge in prices. However, the European Central Bank is unlikely to adjust the policy stance soon. After the short-term fluctuation of the foreign exchange market, the exchange rates will eventually return to a level dictated by the fundamentals, and the continued smooth operation of the RMB exchange rate is a high probability event."
7384,值得注意的是，随着市场对人民币预期更趋平稳，人民币资产对境外投资者的吸引力也逐渐凸显。,"It is worth noting that, as the market expects a more stable renminbi, the attractiveness of renminbi assets to foreign investors will also gradually increase."

The fire is now effectively under control. One person was slightly injured. The cause of the explosion is still under investigation."
7393,新京报记者注意到，早在2015年，涉事化工厂就因违规排污，被包括河南电视台在内的媒体曝光。,"A Beijing News reporter noticed that in 2015, the chemical plant in question was exposed by the media including Henan TV Station for contamination in violation of the law."

7405,本届中华环境奖的评选，旨在表彰那些为改善环境民生作出贡献的单位及个人，以体现对民意的尊重。,The selection of the current China Environmental Award was aimed at honoring entities and individuals that have contributed to improving the environment and people’s livelihoods so as to reflect popular will.
7406,在评选委员会看来，以生态立县为本的浙江省桐庐县当获此殊荣。,"As far as the judging panel was concerned, Tonglu County in Zhejiang Province which was founded on the basis of ecology should win this honor."
7407,根据大众的投票，Facebook CEO马克·扎克伯格（Mark Zuckerberg）自制家用人工智能助理Jarvis将使用美国影星摩根·弗里曼（Morgan Freeman）的声音。,"According to popular vote, the voice of US actor Morgan Freeman will be used for Jarvis, the domestic AI helper Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg built himself."
7408,这套系统在扎克伯格家中运行，它的名字与电影《钢铁侠》中托尼·史塔克（Tony Stark）的人工智能助手相同。,"This system operates in the Zuckerberg home, and its name is similar to Tony Stark’s AI helper in the movie “Iron Man”."
7409,湖北警方跨国端掉4个电信诈骗团伙串并31个省市县500余起案件涉案金额7000余万元,"Hubei police smashed four cross-border telecommunication fraud syndicates in connection with more than 500 cases in 31 provinces, cities and counties involving more than RMB70 million"
7410,本报记者蔡长春《法制日报》记者今天从公安部了解到，由公安部指挥、湖北襄阳警方赴马来西亚，在马来西亚警察总署配合下破获的跨国系列电信网络诈骗案，是一起比较有代表性的台湾系电信网络诈骗案件。,"Staff reporter Cai Changchun. “Legal Daily” learned from the Ministry of Public Security today that a series of cross-border telecommunication network scams was uncovered in an action under the command of the Ministry of Public Security entailing the police from Xiangyang, Hubei going to Malaysia, and with the cooperation of the Royal Malaysian Police. It was a fairly typical Taiwanese telecommunication network scam."
7411,足球界财务规则对内马尔 (Neymar) 转会巴黎有何影响？,How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris
7412,旨在防止欧洲豪门足球俱乐部不受限制支出的规则并不会阻碍内马尔以创记录的价格从西班牙的巴塞罗那俱乐部转会到法国的巴黎圣日尔曼足球俱乐部 (PSG) 。,Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
7413,由此造成的后果则是欧洲足球协会联盟 (UEFA) 对巴黎圣日尔曼足球俱乐部实行进一步降级。欧洲足球协会联盟是欧洲足球比赛的管理机构，有权禁止各球队参加广受关注的欧冠联赛。,"Any consequences will come further down the line for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body overseeing the European game which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament."
7414,2011 年欧足联推出的《金融公平竞赛规则》 (FFP) 意味着巴黎圣日尔曼足球俱乐部最终必须证明内马尔的转会获得资金资助而不会造成巨额亏损。,Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was funded without incurring huge losses.
7415,巴塞罗那俱乐部已经支付了 2.22 亿欧元（2.62 亿美元），仅仅是为了支付该名巴西球员的解约费用，而内马尔的薪水每年将高达数千万美元。,Barcelona has been paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will command a salary that will run to tens of millions of dollars a year.
7416,以下是内马尔转会至法国所产生的一些财务影响。,Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
7417,考虑到该球队的资金来自财大气粗的卡塔尔统治家族，巴黎圣日尔曼足球俱乐部当然可以用现金签约内马尔，并将他纳入到其他明星云集的战队。,"PSG can certainly stump up the cash to sign Neymar and add him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar."
7418,俱乐部可以花巨资购买球员，但他们必须利用合法的收入来源来弥补所花巨资，使他们在足球的相关业务上实现盈亏平衡。,"Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on acquiring players but they have to counterbalance that with legitimate sources of income, allowing them to approach break-even on their football-related business."
7419,《金融公平竞赛规则》是由米歇尔?普拉蒂尼 (Michel Platini) 在 2007 年当选为欧足联主席后提出的构想。,FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
7420,这位前法国球员认为，对于那些为追求成功而债台高筑的俱乐部而言，如果银行或所有人撤回支持资金，他们实际上是在欺骗，置俱乐部于毁灭的风险。,The former France player believed that clubs who ran up huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.
7421,2011 年，《规则》的关注点从俱乐部债务问题转向俱乐部的损失状况监测。,"In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs' debts to monitoring their losses instead."
7422,这一变化意味着，罗马?阿布拉莫维奇 (Roman Abramovich) 在 2003 年收购切尔西俱乐部时使用的商业模式，即购买一家有潜力的俱乐部，然后花巨资改善球队并将其建立一个全球品牌，现在面临更苛刻的处境。,"The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential, and then spend heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - become a tougher proposition."
7423,在截至 2018 的三年《规则》评估期中，俱乐部可能会损失 3000 万欧元。,"During the current three-year FFP assessment period that runs through 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros."
7424,尽管阿布在 2015 年被时任主席所贬损，但欧足联继任者亚历山大?赛福瑞 (Aleksander Ceferin) 仍然致力于阻止过度开支。,"And despite Platini being ousted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to deterring excessive spending."
7425,“当然《规则》还没有失效，我们肯定会加强未来的法规 ”，欧足联负责《规则》相关事务的安德鲁?特拉韦尔索 (Andrea Traverso) 上周告诉美联社。,"""Certainly FFP is not dead and we will, for sure, reinforce the rules going forward,"" Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week."
7426,虽然巴黎圣日尔曼足球俱乐部将一次性付清内马尔的买断条款，但它也可以在合同期限内根据会计目的进行金额分配。,"Although PSG will have paid Neymar's buyout clause in one lump sum, it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract."
7427,内马尔已经签署了一项为期五年的协议，所以转会费在未来五年的年度账户中可能会显示为 4440 万欧元的费用。,"Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could be shown as a 44.4 million-euro cost in the annual accounts for the next five years."
7428,2014 年实施的第一波《规则》制裁使巴黎圣日尔曼足球俱乐部，以及阿布扎比旗下的曼彻斯特城俱乐部受到了最严厉的制裁。,"The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, hit with the heaviest sanctions."
7429,"巴黎圣日尔曼足球俱乐部被判罚款 6000 万欧元 (按当时汇率计为 8200 万美元) , 后来减少到 2000 万欧元，并要求在 2014-15 赛季的冠军联赛该球队减少球员到 21 名，而不是正常的 25 名球员。",PSG was handed a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Champions League squads to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of the normal 25.
7430,"欧足联正虎视眈眈盯着那些试图通过与俱乐部所有者挂钩来增加收入,欺瞒金融监管机构的俱乐部。",UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who might try to outwit its financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to a club's owners.
7431,虽然卡塔尔的公司可以赞助巴黎圣日尔曼足球俱乐部，但如果赞助金额被认为超过标准市场价格，那么欧足联不会将其视为合法收入。,"While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates UEFA would not allow it to count as legitimate income."
7432,这是 2014 年发生的事情，欧足联当时裁定卡塔尔旅游局赞助巴黎圣日尔曼足球俱乐部的金额被夸大了。,That is what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority sponsorship of PSG was inflated.
7433,据报道，内马尔在巴黎圣日尔曼足球俱乐部收入的一部分可能来自 2022 年卡塔尔世界杯组委会的付款。,It has been reported that part of Neymar's PSG earnings could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.
7434,但是，巴黎圣日尔曼足球俱乐部和该组委会均否认内马尔将担任世界杯大使，而对欧足联的监管机构来说，作出这样的举措是很容易的。,But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver would be easy for UEFA's regulators to expose.
7435,近期对巴黎圣日尔曼足球俱乐部实施的制裁意味着，欧足联将更加警惕任何绕开规则的企图。,Past sanctions slapped on PSG means that UEFA will be even more watchful of any attempt to circumvent the rules.
7436,周四知情人士称，欧足联并未与巴黎圣日尔曼足球俱乐部就内马尔的转会事宜进行预先讨论。,"UEFA has not been in pre-emptive discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said Thursday."
7437,上述人士均仅以不具名的身份与美联社进行接触，因为他们未获授权讨论巴黎圣日尔曼足球俱乐部的状况。,They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
7438,上次公布的账目显示，巴黎圣日尔曼足球俱乐部在 2015-16 年度的营业收入为 5.424 亿欧元，盈利超过 1000 万欧元。,The last published accounts show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015-16 on a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
7439,上一会计年度的账目尚未公布。,Accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published.
7440,巴黎圣日尔曼足球俱乐部预计内马尔的加盟将为赞助活动，特许经营和球衣销售带来福音。,"PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales."
7441,该俱乐部预计签署内马尔后营收额将增长至少 30％。,The club expects turnover would grow by at least 30 percent on the back of the signing.
7442,很显然，看到其中名气最大的球员离开，西班牙联盟深感愤怒，试图阻碍内马尔的该举动，并声称巴黎圣日尔曼足球俱乐部违反《规则》。,"Clearly irritated to see one of soccer's biggest players leaving, the Spanish league tried to stymie Neymar's move, claiming that PSG will be breaching FFP."
7443,"西甲联赛主席哈维尔?特巴斯告诉西班牙报纸AS称，“这是一起'金融兴奋剂'的明显例证,俱乐部和国家都是一样的”，指的是对巴黎圣日尔曼足球俱乐部拥有最终所有权的卡塔尔。","""It is a clear case of 'financial doping', with the club and the state,"" La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG."
7444,阿森纳球队（该俱乐部的所有人为美国体育大亨）主教练阿尔塞纳?温格 (Arsene Wenger) ，对国家资助俱乐部的态度与西甲联赛均持保留意见。,"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club."
7445,“这是所有权带来的后果，而这彻底改变了过去 15 年足球的整个生态 ”，温格周四表示。,"""It is the consequence of the ownerships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years,"" Wenger said Thursday."
7446,“一旦国家拥有俱乐部，那么什么事情都会发生。,"""Once a country owns a club, everything is possible."
7447,这将会使遵守《规则》变得非常困难，因为对于一个国家而言，有许多不同的方式或各种利益来要求大牌的球员代表一个国家。”,"It becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent a country."""
7448,智能交互机器人研发商Rokid获新投资 淡马锡领投,Smart interactive robot developer Rokid received new investment; Temasek is the lead investor
7449,近年来，人工智能领域的初创公司持续受到资本热捧。,"In recent years, start-ups in the AI sector have continued to be a hot favorite of capital."
7450,人工智能Rokid即于近日完成新一轮融资，由淡马锡领投，瑞士信贷、CDIB（台湾中华开发金融控股公司旗下投资机构）、老股东IDG资本等机构跟投。,"AI Rokid recently completed a round of funding, led by Temasek. Other investors included Credit Suisse, CDIB (the investment arm of China Development Financial Holdings Co., Ltd.), and existing shareholder IDG Capital."
7451,据悉，本轮融资规模约为1亿美元，瑞信和CDIB首次在国内人工智能领域的融资交易中出现。,It is understood that the size of this round of funding was approximately US$100 million. Both Credit Suisse and CDIB were first time investors in China’s domestic AI industry.
7452,"Rokid是一家智能交互机器人研发商,致力于机器人领域研究，产品可操控家中智能设备，具有能持续自主学习和成长功能，还具备识别、听懂、反馈等功能。","Rokid is a developer of smart interactive robots, and is committed to robotics research. It products can control smart devices in the home, and has continuous autonomous learning and growth functions. It also features recognition, comprehension and feedback functions."
7453,本轮融资将主要用于研发、人才引进、战略推动及产业链的投资布局。,"Proceeds from this round of funding will be used for R&amp;D, talent recruitment, strategic push and industry chain investment layout."
7454,此前，Rokid曾于2014年8月，获得IDG、线性资本、Mfund、元璟资本830万美元天使轮投资。;2015年10月，公司又获得华登国际领投、天使投资方跟投的千万美元A轮投资;2016年11月1日，Rokid完成由尚珹资本领投，IDG、Mfund、元璟资本、华登国际等机构跟投的B轮融资。,"Rokid previously raised US$8.3 million in August 2014 in the Angel Round from IDG, Linear Venture, Mfund and Vision Capital. In October 2014, the company again received at least US$10 million in Series A funding led by Walden International, with the Angel investors as participants. On November 1, 2016, Rokid completed Series B funding, led by Advantech Capital; other investors included IDG, Mfund, Vision Capital and Walden International."
7455,当时Rokid称，B轮融资后公司估值已达到4.5亿美元。,"At the time, Rokid claimed that after the Series B funding, the company’s valuation would reach US$450 million."
7456,2017年5月，Rokid发布了消费级智能语音机器人“若琪·月石”，将人工智能和家庭场景结合起来，售价为1399元。,"In May 2017, Rokid unveiled its consumer class smart voice robot “Rokid - Pebble”, integrating AI and the home, priced at RMB1,399."
7457,该款机器人使用语音合成、自然语言理解、语音识别技术和麦克风阵列技术，具有聊天对话、播放音乐、智能家居功能。,"This robot uses speech synthesis, natural language understanding, speech recognition technology and microphone array technology, with conversational, music broadcast and smart home features."
7458,曾获得国际消费电子产品展（CES）Tech For A Better World及Home Audio/Video Components And Accessories两项大奖，以及有设计界奥斯卡之称的德国IF设计奖。,"It has won two major CES awards - Tech For A Better World and Home Audio/Video Components And Accessories, as well as Germany’s iF Design Award, known as the Oscars of the design world."
7459,在刚刚闭幕的2018CES上，Rokid又发布了一款新产品：消费级增强现实AR眼镜RokidGlass。,"At the 2018 CES which had just ended, Rokid unveiled another new product: the consumer class augmented reality AR glasses RokidGlass."
7460,"该款眼镜将作为独立头显使用，即无需连接智能手机或外部电脑,预计将在2018年实现商业化。","These glasses are used as independent head displays, and do not require connections to smartphones or external computers. It is expected to be commercialized in 2018."
7461,此前，公司已发布第一代产品家庭机器人RokidAlien和第二代产品智能音箱RokidPebble。,"Previously, the company had already released its first generation home robot, RokidAlien and second generation product, smart voice box RokidPebble."
7462,今年恰逢鲁迅诞辰135周年、逝世80周年，用编剧俞志清的话讲：“因为热爱鲁迅，所以才有了创作的冲动。”,"This is the 135th anniversary Lu Xun’s birth and 80th anniversary of his death. In the words of scriptwriter Zhou Zhiqing, “I love Lu Xun. That’s why I have creative impulse.”"
7463,据苹果公司透露，从今年2月28日起，中国内地的iCloud服务将转由云上贵州公司负责运营。,"Apple revealed that with effect from February 28, Guizhou-Cloud will be the new operator of iCloud services in Mainland China."
7464,苹果公司表示，“与云上贵州的合作将使我们得以继续提高iCloud服务的速度以及可靠性，同时也符合中国的云服务须由本地企业运营的新规。”,Apple said that “the partnership with Guizhou-Cloud will allow us improve the speed and reliability of our iCloud services products while also complying with newly passed regulations that cloud services be operated by Chinese companies.”
7465,停用期间，用户此前储存在iCloud的数据资料还将保存在iCloud里，不会丢失。,"During the period of deactivation, data and information previously stored in iCloud by users will still remain in iCloud, and will not be lost."
7466,如果停用后用户希望在2月28日后使用iCloud服务，则需要先接受新的条款和条件，以确保账户被重新激活并迁至云上贵州。,"If users wish to use iCloud services after February 28 after deactivation, they must first accept the new terms and conditions to ensure that their accounts are reactivated and transferred to Guizhou-Cloud."
7467,同时，苹果公司在声明中也强调，“Apple拥有强大的数据隐私和安全保护机制，并且不会在我们的任何系统中创建后门。”,"Meanwhile, Apple emphasized in its statement that, “Apple has a strong data privacy and security mechanism and will not create a backdoor in any of our systems.”"
7468,iCloud贵安新区主数据中心也将是是苹果公司在中国设立的第一个数据中心项目，项目落成后，将用于存储中国苹果用户的数据。,"iCloud’s main data center at Gui-An New Area will be the first data center Apple has set up in China. On completion, it will be used to store the data of Apple users in China."

7471,在2011年加入Twitter之前，梅辛格曾担任甲骨文的开发副总裁。,"Prior to joining Twitter in 2011, Messinger was Vice President of development at Oracle."

7473,3D合家欢动画电影《豆福传》25日在武汉举行首映礼，《豆福传》导演邹燚，《豆福传》动画导演蒙智慧，影片配乐制作人、艾美奖得主TomDisher悉数亮相，现场分享电影创作的幕后故事。,"“Tofu”, a 3D animated feature film designed for a general audience held its premiere in Wuhan on the 25th. Zou Yi, Director of “Tofu”, Meng Zhihui, Animation Director of “Tofu”, as well as Tom Disher, film soundtrack composer and Emmy Award winner were present to share their behind-the-scenes story of the film’s creation."
7474,《豆福传》取材于中国传统文化中汉代淮南王刘安的故事，脱胎于“刘安做豆腐，因错而成”的传统典故，讲述了主人公“豆福”由一颗豆子幻化成人形，克服重重困难，坚持修仙梦想的故事。这部萌物修仙动画电影与湖北的地方文化渊源颇深。,"“Tofu” is based on a traditional allusion concerning Liu An, Prince of Huainan in the Han Dynasty - “Liu An made a mistake and invented tofu”. It is an account of “Dou Fu”, the leading character, a bean who miraculously took on human form, how he overcame numerous difficulties and persevered in his dream to become an immortal. This adorable animated film about becoming an immortal is closely connected with Hubei’s local culture."
7475,湖北十堰市境内的武当山，是联合国公布的世界文化遗产地之一，也是道家文化和武当武术的发源地，被称为“亘古无双胜境，天下第一仙山”。,"Wudang Mountains, located in Shiyan, Hubei Province, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as well as the place of origin of Toaist culture and Wudang martial arts. It is known as “a unique scenic spot since ancient times, and the premier celestial mountain in the world”."
7476,导演邹燚透露，在影片创作前期，他曾与主创团队前往武当山采风。,Director Zou Yi revealed that he and his creative team traveled to Wudang Mountains to conduct research for the film prior to its creation.
7477,他表示，《豆福传》的故事便发生在西汉武帝年间，淮南王刘安炼丹修仙的背景下，影片主人公“豆福”便是一颗在刘安炼丹时意外幻化成人形的豆子。,"He said that the story of “Tofu” occurred during the reign of Emperor Wu of Western Han Dynasty, against the backdrop of Liu An, Prince of Huainan, making pills to attain immortality. The leading character “Dou Fu” was a bean that miraculously took on human form by accident while Liu An was making these pills."
7478,除了作为道家文化发源地的武当山，湖北还与中国历史悠久的传统乐器——编钟有着很深的渊源。,"In addition to Wudang Mountains, the place of origin of Toaist culture, Hubei Province is also closely connected with the chime - a traditional musical instrument with long history in China."
7479,在近期召开的一次国际会议上，专家预计，在25年内具备人工智能的机器人将走进人们的卧室，为人类提供各种服务。,"In a recent international conference, experts forecast that robots with AI will enter people's bedrooms in 25 years, and provide various services for humans."
7480,通过研究，科学家们发现记忆有一个最大的特点，就是其不准确性。,"Through research, scientists have discovered that one of the most significant characteristics of memory is its inaccuracy."
7481,创作于1934年的《雷雨》是曹禺的第一部作品，是中国现代话剧成熟的标志，也是被翻译成各国语言文字最多的中国话剧。,"Written in 1934, “Thunderstorm” is Cao Yu’s first work, and the sophisticated hallmark of modern Chinese play. It is also the most translated Chinese play."
7482,怀旧感染力风靡市场——《哈啦夏令营》和《侦探双雄》,"Nostalgia Goes Niche in ""Wet Hot American Summer"" and ""Comrade Detective"""
7483,复述这一故事是为了怀念演员们 80 年代的风光岁月以及 90 年代的垃圾时代（大卫·韦恩和迈克尔·修华特为 MTV 制作素描喜剧《国家》前后）；同时也是对怀旧本身的怀念，对 2001 年的怀念；这一年之前，诸如伊丽莎白·班克斯、艾米·波勒和保罗·路德等众多明星尚未风生水起。,"So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters' '80s glory days; for the '90s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy ""The State"" for MTV); and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things."
7484,作为一种文化艺术品，它是我们脸书时代永久回忆的模仿和体现。,"As a cultural artifact, it's both a sendup and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent reminiscence."
7485,但作为一个系列，这感觉就像时间不够用了。,"But as a franchise, it feels like it's running out of time."
7486,《营地第一天》播出后反响强烈，但这不仅仅因为它的荒诞幽默（剧情是关于一只会说话的蔬菜罐头的原创故事，由 H·乔恩·本杰明配音）。,"""First Day of Camp"" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurdist humor (it included an origin story for a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin)."
7487,剧情中加倍运用核心笑梗 - 中年演员扮演正值捣蛋年纪的孩子 - 这使得无法重新回到过去也成为了搞笑的一部分。,By doubling down on the core gag - middle-age actors playing horny kids coming of age - it made the impossibility of recapturing the past part of the joke.
7488,《十年后》中，成年人实实在在的扮演成年人，情绪便没有太根深蒂固，模仿也更加散漫，其中包括对 90 年代跟踪电影的即兴创作，如《推动摇篮的手》。,"""Ten Years Later,"" with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody more scattershot, including a riff on '90s stalker flicks like ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."""
7489,某个时刻，一个角色陷于一台苹果笔记本、一些直线溜冰鞋和“一些 1991 年的其他东西”当中。,"At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates and ""a bunch of other things from 1991."""
7490,许多核心故事都是一样的。,Many of the core stories are the same.
7491,甜心先生（修华特先生饰）现在已经成为了小说家，但他仍然没有忘记凯蒂（玛格丽特·莫罗饰）。,"Sweet-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau)."
7492,维克多（肯·马里诺饰）仍然保有处男之身。,Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
7493,剧中还有另一个涉及罗纳德·里根（也是由修华特先生扮演）的险恶阴谋，由乔治·H·W·布什（迈克尔·伊恩·布莱克饰，给人留下深刻印象）唆使。,"And there's another battily villainous plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now abetted by George H. W. Bush (a well-inhabited impression by Michael Ian Black)."
7494,一如既往，这一系列最好的部分是插话。,"As always, the best part of the franchise is the digressions."
7495,看到这位永远年轻的路德先生尤其有趣，他在电影《单身贵族》中炫耀了马特·狄龙的灵魂补丁，之前的《校园巨人》中的安迪现在感觉就像一个巨人。,"It's especially fun to see the forever-young Mr. Rudd, sporting Matt Dillon's soul patch from ""Singles,"" whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like a geezer."
7496,这是随机疯狂的时刻，可能会为这一电影提供动力，犹如递归的《人生七年》系列，直至得出我认为合乎逻辑的结论：《哈啦夏令营：二十年后》，它的最后一幕是让这帮卡司去看《哈啦夏令营》的电影首映式。,"It's the moments of random lunacy that might power this franchise on, like a kind of recursive ""Seven Up!"" series, until it reaches what I assume will be its logical conclusion: ""Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later,"" whose last scene will have the gang going to see the movie premiere of ""Wet Hot American Summer."""
7497,与此同时，亚马逊的《侦探双雄》诉说了不同的怀旧内容：冷战复兴主义的《美国谍梦》，电影《极寒之城》，甚至是东西方摔跤意象的《GLOW：华丽女子摔跤联盟》。,"""Comrade Detective"" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different brand of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of ""The Americans,"" the film ""Atomic Blonde"" and even ""GLOW,"" with its East versus West wrestling iconography."
7498,这部由布莱恩·盖特伍德和亚历山德罗·田中创作的喜剧，被导演里斯·托马斯推上了电视屏幕：这是一部难兄难弟喜剧片，剧情背景设置在 80 年代的罗马尼亚，讲述两名布加勒斯特官员为了真理、无神论和马克思列宁主义路线而奋斗的故事。,"The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way."
7499,主要角色 - 硬派的格里戈尔和理想主义的艾瑟夫 - 分别由小弗洛林·皮尔斯齐和科尔内留·乌利奇扮演，其对话由查宁·塔图姆（也是执行制片人）和约瑟夫·戈登-莱维特用英语配音。,"The lead roles - hard-boiled Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt."
7500,这是一个绝妙的主意。,It's a brilliant idea.
7501,但这不仅仅是一个想法。,But it's not much more than an idea.
7502,其中有一些很好的视觉噱头（警察看电视里下象棋打发时间，因为美国人喜欢踢足球）。,There are some fine sight gags (the police pass the time watching chess on TV as Americans might football).
7503,而且有众多名人配音演员 - 其中包括珍妮·斯蕾特、尼克·奥弗曼、马赫莎拉哈什巴兹·阿里和科洛·塞维尼 - 打造了一场精彩的声音盛会。,"And the roster of famous voice-over actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice."
7504,但是，《侦探双雄》如此致力于打造一部喧嚣逼真的宣传喜剧 - 剧中有一名头戴里根面具的杀手 - 而它通常也扮演这样的角色。,"But ""Comrade Detective"" is so committed to the verisimilitude of a hamfisted propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one."
7505,这部六集长的电视稍显拖拉，且喜剧效果释放的不够快速或频繁。,"At six long episodes, it drags, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough."
7506,《侦探双雄》片长编辑地更为严格，在格雷戈尔和艾瑟夫反复访问美国大使馆时，呈现出了更好的煽动讽刺效果，因为大使馆的大堂里总是有两个胖子狼吞虎咽掉一堆汉堡。,"Edited to a tighter length, ""Comrade Detective"" might deliver better on its agitprop satire, as when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wolfing down a pile of hamburgers."
7507,对于想象中的共产主义观众来说，这个信息意味着西方文化可以把任何东西变成素材来狂欢。,"The message, for the imagined communist audience, is that Western culture can turn anything into fodder to binge."

7510,一些专家认为，当前形势下，东北工业新一轮振兴不仅关系到全国本轮经济复苏，还将对我国制造业长远发展和国际竞争力产生影响，因此亟待调整转型。,"Some experts believed that under the present circumstances, a new round of revitalization of the industries in Northeast China will not only concern the nation’s current economic recovery, it will also have an impact on the long-term growth and international competitiveness of China's manufacturing sector. Hence, there is an urgent call for adjustments and structural transformation to take place."
7511,企业效益普遍下滑传统行业更现亏损原材料工业和重型机械设备制造业效益严重下滑甚至出现亏损，是本轮经济低迷中东北工业的首要表现。,"Traditional industries saw a general decline in performance, and even incurred losses. The raw material industry, and the heavy machinery and equipment manufacturing sector saw performance decline significantly, and even incurred losses. These were the first signs from the industries in Northeast China amid the current sluggish economy."
7512,以往在经济下行中，主要是低端、初级产品受冲击大的特点，但此次经济波动中，东北传统工业高端、低端工业产品都受到影响。,"When the economy decelerated in the past, low-end and primary commodities were the most significantly affected.

However, sales of these product categories fell significantly. In particular, the sales volume of steel plates for shipbuilding plunged 50% year-on-year."
7514,鞍钢股份(辽宁省工信委冶金处处长郝庆顺介绍说，冶金是辽宁的第三大支柱产业，年产6000万吨的钢铁产能排在全国第三位。,"Angang Steel Company (Hao Qingshun, Director of the Metallurgical Department of Liaoning Provincial Industry and Informatization Commission, said that metallurgy was the third largest pillar industry in Liaoning, with annual steel production capacity of 60 million tonnes, ranked third nationwide."
7515,今年1-5月份，辽宁省粗钢产量2154万吨，国家政策鼓励、地方政府建设力度大的项目所需产品产销形势较好，市场竞争较为激烈的产品下降幅度较大，是东北制造行业呈现的又一特点。,"For the first five months of this year, crude steel production in Liaoning Province amounted to 21.54 million tonnes. Sales of products required by projects that were encouraged by national policy and where there was strong local government construction activity was better. Products in which market competition was more intense fell by a larger magnitude. This was another characteristic of Northeast China’s manufacturing sector."
7516,和成年后的努力、有担当形成鲜明反差的是，童年时期的吴彦祖很调皮，甚至可以说是叛逆。,"In sharp contrast to being diligent and responsible on reaching adulthood, Daniel Wu was a very mischievous child, even rebellious."

He interpreted his character as someone who “does not wear his heart on his sleeve”, quietly giving his all to Bai Qian, and concealing all his feelings."
7519,杨洋表示需要调动起全身的情绪，来将角色隐忍的悲伤传递给观众，“这对我的表演是一个新的挑战，在演戏过程中我真的是快要憋到内伤”。,"Yang Yang said that he had to rouse all his emotions to convey the character’s hidden sadness to the audience. “This was certainly a new challenge for me as an actor. While acting this character, I was so emotionally suppressed that I almost suffered internal injury”."

7528,取而代之的是一个简单的横幅，一个开会的位置，一个装会议材料的简易环保纸质文件袋，一个环保纸杯盛装的茶水。,"Instead, there a simple banner, a meeting place, a simple recyclable paper document bag containing materials for the meeting and a recyclable paper cup for tea or water."
7529,会议材料相对于以前薄了一些，几张纸就把会议的主题和议程概括完了。,The meeting materials were less dense than that of the past. A few pieces of paper summarized the theme and the agenda of the meeting.

7534,英格兰银行将维持 0.25% 的利率,Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
7535,英格兰银行将在晚些时候宣布利率将保持不变，此前疲软的经济增长和宽松的通货膨胀就已让上调希望破灭。,The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after lacklustre economic growth and easing inflation dampened speculation over a hike.
7536,英格兰银行发出警告，因为其在加强家庭收入紧缩的同时控制利率，经济增长将继续呈“疲软”之势。,"The Bank of England has warned economic growth will remain ""sluggish"" as it kept interest rates on hold amid a tightening squeeze on family incomes."
7537,该行货币政策委员会 (MPC) 的决策者以 6-2 的投票决定维持 0.25% 的利率，而本月少数成员呼吁提高利率，即使疲软的经济增长已经减弱了上调的助力。,"Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members this month calling for a rise as lacklustre economic growth has weakened support for a hike."
7538,在其季度通货膨胀报告中，英格兰银行将 2017 年和 2018 年的增长预测分别缩至 1.7% 和 1.6%，并发出警告称家庭收入紧缩将会持续，同时通货膨胀将于秋季暴涨至近 3%。,"In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and cautioned the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation still expected to surge close to 3% in the autumn."
7539,但其表示在接下来的几年中，将需要上调利率以遏制脱欧带来的通货膨胀，同时借款费用可能需要以金融市场中期望的更大幅度上调。,But it signalled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets.
7540,一年前受脱欧影响而实施了大规模的经济促进政策，各成员也投票决定将其撤回。,Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economy-boosting package unleashed a year ago in the aftermath of Brexit.
7541,英格兰银行将宣布定期融资计划告停，从明年 2 月份开始为各银行提供廉价资金，虽然该银行称根据该计划，该行目前需要在 1150 亿英镑的基础上再追加 150 亿英镑。,"It will call time on the Term Funding Scheme to offer cheap-finance to banks from next February, although it said it was now expected to offer £15 billion more under the scheme - at £115 billion."
7542,在利率决策会议记录中，英格兰银行称：“在 MPC 的核心预测中，国内生产总值 (GDP) 在近期依然呈疲软之势，因为家庭实际收入紧缩将继续压制消费。”,"In minutes of the rates decision, the Bank said: ""In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains sluggish in the near-term as the squeeze on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."""
7543,关于利率，该行反复重申需要“一定的货币政策紧缩”来镇压通货膨胀，而且需要以比市场期望的“更大的程度”。,"On rates, it reiterated that ""some tightening of monetary policy"" would be needed to cool inflation and by a ""somewhat greater"" extent than markets expect."
7544,目前市场预计在明年第三季度实现第一次增长，在 2020 年实现第二次。,Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
7545,但是该行强调，任何上调都会是“缓慢”而“克制”的。,"But the Bank stressed that any hikes would be ""gradual"" and ""limited."""
7546,该行今年和明年的增长预测呈下降趋势，而五月份的预测为 1.9% 和 1.7%。,The Bank's downgraded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
7547,该行维持 2018 年增长 1.8% 的预测。,It maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018.
7548,英镑对美元汇率下降，欧元也紧随其后。,Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.

7550,该保持不变的决策出现之前，愈演愈烈的上调期望因最近不容乐观的增长数据而破灭。第二季度 GDP 增至 0.3%，而前三个月只有 0.2%。,"The no-change decision comes after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened mounting expectations of a hike, with GDP edging up to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months."
7551,该行称第三季度的增长可能保持在 0.3%，虽然年底将会小幅上升。,"Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year, according to the Bank."
7552,普通家庭受到通货膨胀暴涨的冲击，而工资增长又微不足道，英格兰银行最近的通货膨胀报告并没有为他们带来喜讯，因为该行称紧缩在变好之前还会变得更坏，,Its latest inflation report offered little cheer for households being hit by soaring inflation and paltry pay rises as it said the squeeze will get worse before it gets better.
7553,并称货币政策“不能防止”接下来几年中对收入的打击，但是工资有望在三年预测结束时“大规模”恢复。,"It added that monetary policy ""cannot prevent"" the hit to incomes over the next few years, but expects wages will recover ""significantly"" towards the end of its three-year forecast."
7554,同时，因为英镑贬值，对英国商品的需求大幅增长，经济将会受到刺激，抵消部分低消费的影响。,"The economy is also set for a boost from surging demand for British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending."
7555,该决策制定之前一年，令人震惊的欧盟全民公投让英镑暴跌，八月份利率下调至 0.25%。,"The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping."
7556,英格兰银行估计其可能需要四年时间才能完全对物价和英国经济产生影响。,The Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy.
7557,在该行公布其最新利率裁定之前，利率上调的呼声就不绝于耳，因为通货膨胀令早已倍感压力的普通家庭雪上加霜，同时三位决策者呼吁 7 月份将利率上调至 0.5%。,"Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July."
7558,上个月通货膨胀从 6 月份的 2.9% 退至 2.6%，虽然英格兰银行称这在预料之中，且在接下来的几个月中将再次上升。,"Inflation eased back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months."
7559,该行称相对其 2% 的目标，超过的部分已经完全是疲软的英镑最后的底线了。,"The Bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was ""entirely"" down to the weak pound."
7560,Coreco Mortgage Brokers 的董事安德鲁·蒙特雷克称：“鉴于掉期利率近期下跌，抵押贷款市场似乎将再次变得更具竞争力，因为贷款方强烈呼吁更多业务，并期待以积极态势为今年划下完美句号。,"Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: ""Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clamour for business and look to end the year in positive fashion."
7561,对那些可能快要结束现有交易的人来说，这样的市场看起来特别有利，因为再抵押（很多都可以免手续费而且利率低）越来越受欢迎。,"The market looks particularly good for those who may be coming to the end of their existing deals as re-mortgages, many with fee-free options as well as low rates, become ever more popular."""
7562,中国地震台网正式测定，11月13日19时02分在新西兰(南纬42.53度，东经173.05度)发生8.0级地震，震源深度10千米，首都惠灵顿震感强烈。,"China Earthquake Networks Center officially determined that a magnitude 8.0 earthquake struck New Zealand on November 13 at 19:02 (42.53 degrees south latitude, 173.05 degrees east longitude), with the epicenter 10km deep.

7566,它同意在上诉法院去年支持高等法院裁决后为试验提供资金。该裁决表示，尽管 NHS 声称地方当局应该为这种药物提供资金，但 NHS 有权支付 PrEP 的费用。,"It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite its claims that local authorities should fund it."
7567,周四宣布的举动被英国NHS首席执行官西蒙史蒂文斯 (Simon Stevens) 称为一次“重大的新干预”，而国家艾滋病信托基金会 (NAT) 则将其形容为“关键时刻”。,The move announced on Thursday was hailed as a 'major new intervention' by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'pivotal moment'.
7568,伦敦、布赖顿、曼彻斯特、利物浦和谢菲尔德等地的性健康诊所将成为首批人员登记的性健康诊所。在10月份将会有更多的诊所加入，之后在 2018 年 4 月在英格兰范围进行全面实施。,"Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 2018."
7569,暴露前预防用药 (PrEP) 是一种在性行为之前服用、以降低感染艾滋病毒风险的艾滋病病毒药物。,Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.
7570,试验显示，PrEP 可显著降低感染风险人群的艾滋病毒传播。,Trials have shown PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at-risk of infection.
7571,在性行为之前服用 PrEP 意味着人体内有足够的特定药物来预防 HIV 感染。,Taking PrEP before sex means there is just enough of certain drugs in a person's body to prevent an HIV infection taking hold.
7572,这种药物可以每天或在性交前两小时服用。,Such drugs can be taken every day or as soon as two hours before having sex.
7573,那些有资格接受治疗的人群包括同性恋、双性恋男性、跨性别人士以及未成功接受治疗的阳性HIV携带者。,"Those eligible for the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and those with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully receiving treatment."
7574,诊所将确定符合条件、且同意试验的参与者，包括男性、女性、跨性别人士以及其性伴侣HIV感染状态是否接受抗逆转录病毒治疗未知的人员。,"Clinics will identify eligible participants who consent to the trial, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti-retroviral treatment."
7575,在英格兰居住并注册全科医生的人员也可以在他们当地参加的性健康诊所报名参加。,People living and registered with a GP in England will also be able to enrol for potential participation at their local participating sexual health clinic.
7576,该计划将花费 1000 万英镑，而NHS英格兰分支机构签署了一份合同，在进行国际竞争性采购后于本周采购这些药物。,The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to source the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
7577,该试验旨在通过在大样本基础上，收集有关对其如何定位、吸收和实施的临床证据来评估 PrEP 的全部潜力。,"The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken up, and implemented on a large scale."
7578,史蒂文斯先生说：“这项重大的新干预措施应该对预防艾滋病毒起到广泛的和越来越成功的补充和强化作用。,Mr Stevens said: 'This major new intervention should complement and supercharge the wide-ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.
7579,这是 30 多年来值得在解决人类主要健康挑战中取得进步的行动的又一个里程碑。”,It's another milestone in more than three decades' worth of progress in tackling one of humanity's major health challenges.'

7582,从 9 月份开始，艾滋病毒高危人群将通过 NHS 资助的、在英格兰开展的这项试验，获得一种准许的新工具，这种工具是真正可单独实施，无需与性伙伴协商，这将会为许许多多人的生活带来改善。,"From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access via this NHS-funded trial in England to an empowering new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."

7587,证据表明作为我们预防艾滋病毒和止传播这种致命的感染疾病的方法的一部分，这种药物可以带来怎么样的变革。,The evidence shows just how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.
7588,这项试验将使我们更进一步地、充分了解 PrEP 的优势。,This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
7589,现在，尽快在全国范围内推出这项试验以便保护接触艾滋病毒的人员，并帮助我们更进一步地终止艾滋病毒在社会中的传播，这点非常重要。”,Now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'

7591,高品质生活：应用阁楼和巧妙设计，将伯爵宫小公寓打造为宽敞的家,Living the high life: mezzanine floor and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home
7592,乔安妮·雷是曾是一位银行家，她十分热衷于整修房屋，2014 年，她从位于骑士桥的大房子搬到了伯爵宫小公寓。,"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for doing up property, downsized from a large home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014."
7593,这间公寓位于一个优雅的安妮女王式露台的一楼 -- 乔安妮没有收拾行李将其出售，这就是对新设计的有力证明。,It is on the first floor of a smart Queen Anne terrace - and it is a testament to the new design that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold on.
7594,“在此之前，我和前男友住在骑士桥的一个更大的房子里，”乔安妮说道。,"""Before this, I was living with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space,"" Joanne says."
7595,“我当时正在找与报价合适的房子。,"""I was looking for something that was comparable for my price."
7596,我在伯爵宫看到这间公寓，它的天花板也很高。,I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
7597,我很中意，当天就提出要约。”,"I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day."""
7598,"自首次看房之后，这个 1,000 平方英尺的公寓现在已经完成了彻底检修。","Since the first viewing, the 1,000sq ft flat has had a complete overhaul."
7599,这个公寓原先是一间布局复杂的单间 -- 需要穿过厨房才能走到卧室 -- 乔安妮当时就想增加储物空间和阁楼，以充分利用充足的天花板高度。,Originally a one-bedroom property with a convoluted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
7600,“我想要高高的天花板、大大的窗户、充足的光线。,"""I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light."
7601,这就是我的要求，”她说道。,"That was my requirement,"" she says."
7602,为此，她聘请了来自 Duck＆Shed 建筑和设计工作室（位于诺丁山）的埃尔凡·阿扎迪来利用这个 12.5 英尺高的天花板，精心打造一个家。这个家不仅是开发项目，还是乔安妮居住的地方。,"To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck &amp; Shed to exploit the 12.5ft ceilings and create a home that wasn't only a development but a place for Joanne to live."
7603,天花板的高度不足以增加两个上下空间，所以建筑挑战在于创建一个高度足够让人站立的的阁楼。,The ceiling wasn't quite tall enough to add two spaces on top of each other so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine that you could stand up in.
7604,埃尔凡必须发挥创意思维，这样才能解决这个问题。,Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the brief.
7605,“钢结构相当复杂，”他解释说。,"""The steelwork is quite complicated,"" he explains."
7606,“我们必须安排好空间，使其上下陈列，并且不需要耸肩弓背。,"""We had to arrange the spaces so that they stacked on top of each other without needing to hunch down."
7607,不仅仅是搭建一个简单的平台那么简单，还要起动这些钢材，以使其处于实现功能的合适高度左右。”,"It wasn't just building a simple platform, but cranking the steels so that they were at the right height for the function above or below."""
7608,通过这种安排，埃尔凡能够在该空间中获得两个全身高的房间 -- 其中可以增添许多趣味元素。,This arrangement allowed Erfan to get two full-height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added drama.
7609,阁楼采用 Retrouvius 品牌的复古铜质窗户，可以俯瞰迷人的生活区域。,"For the mezzanine, a vintage copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area below."

7618,“这里涉及一些工程领域的知识，”埃尔凡对钢筋加固贴面 MDF 门进行解释。,"""A bit of engineering went into that,"" explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door."
7619,“这采用的是平衡原理，所以当你推门时，就很容易滑动。”,"""It's counter-weighted so that when you push the door up, it glides really easily."""
7620,由于巧妙地利用空间和存物，乔安妮额外获得 16 平方米、多了一间卧室以及一个改进的布局。,"Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16sq m, an extra bedroom and an improved layout."
7621,“最终，你卖的就是房屋面积 -- 或者说你的房产估值是以房屋面积为基础的，”埃尔凡说道。,"""At the end of the day, floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued,"" Erfan says."
7622,“基本来说，房地产经纪人会走进去房间，并根据楼层大小进行计算。”,"""In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size."""
7623,他们会设法增加占地空间，同时使用优质材料，从而为这个空间带来了奢华的感觉。,Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge.
7624,埃尔凡表示，“材料都是你亲自挑选，因此有助于在家中创建情感纽带。”,"""The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home,"" says Erfan."
7625,“你不会爱上墙上的电源。,"""You don't fall in love with the electrical feeds in the walls."
7626,这些东西都很重要，但不会扣你心弦。”,"These are important but they don't pull the heart strings."""
7627,事实证明，通过良好的设计以及增加额外面积，标准公寓可以摇身变得让你惊叹不已。,"It goes to show that through good design and increased square metreage, a flat can turn from something standard into something quite amazing."
7628,实际上，你可能会和乔安妮一样，选择住下去。,"In fact, like Joanne, you may choose not to leave."

7669,根据电视明星艾迪?麦奎尔 (Eddie McGuire) 至交 2015 年出版的传记所载，尽管科林是前AFL俱乐部的董事会成员，但他一直保持低调。,"Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL club board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend."
7670,“费尔法克斯传媒 (Fairfax Media) ”周五联系了科林和保罗，以及他们的律师。,"Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis on Friday, and their lawyers."
7671,但是，只有科林通过短信回复。他表示，因为案件已提交至法庭“我真的不能说太多。”,"Only Colin replied, by text message, to say that because the case was before the courts ""I really cannot say much."""
7672,“我的弟弟保罗选择了起诉我，并将我们的家族事务带到法庭上，这是非常、非常令人难过的 ”，他写道。,"""It's very, very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and drag our family name through the courts,"" he wrote."
7673,2016 年年中，，科林在一份法庭文件中写道，他曾试图满足其兄弟的要求。,"In mid-2016, Colin wrote in one court filing that he had tried to accommodate his brother's requests."

7964,有人提议，AM 应该将头衔改为 MWP（威尔士议会议员），这让好多 AM 大为震惊。,There is consternation among some AMs at a suggestion their title should change to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
7965,之所以有人这样提议，是因为计划要将议会名称改为“威尔士议会”。,It has arisen because of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
7966,政治界的 AM 担心这会惹人嘲笑。,AMs across the political spectrum are worried it could invite ridicule.
7967,一名工党 AM 表示，工党成员担心“这个名称与 Twp 和 Pwp 押韵”。,"One Labour AM said his group was concerned ""it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."""
7968,（非威尔士读者须知：在威尔士语中，twp 的意思为“愚蠢”，pwp 意思为“大便”。,For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh twp means daft and pwp means poo.
7969,一名民族党 AM 表示，整个民族党人员都“不满意“，建议换成其他名称。,"A Plaid AM said the group as a whole was ""not happy"" and has suggested alternatives."
7970,一名威尔士保守党人表示，保守党对这次更名“持开放态度”，但指出，发音上很容易将 MWP 发成 Muppet 的音。,"A Welsh Conservative said his group was ""open minded"" about the name change, but noted it was a short verbal hop from MWP to Muppet."
7971,在该语境下，威尔士字母 w 的发音类似于约克郡英语字母 u 的发音。,In this context The Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
7972,议会委员会 (Assembly Commission) 目前正在对名称变更起草法律，他说：“关于委员会成员最终决定选择用什么名字，这是他们自己的事情。”,"The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: ""The final decision on any descriptors of what Assembly Members are called will of course be a matter for the members themselves."""
7973,《2017 年威尔士政府法案》规定，威尔士议会有更名的权力。,The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh assembly the power to change its name.
7974,6 月，委员会公布了关于这些名称提议的公众咨询结果，普遍支持使用”威尔士议会“这一名称。,"In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which found broad support for calling the assembly a Welsh Parliament."
7975,关于 AM 的头衔问题，委员会赞倾向于 WMP（威尔士议会议员），但公众咨询结果中，支持率最高的是 MWP 。,"On the matter of the AMs' title, the Commission favoured Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in a public consultation."
7976,显然，AM 建议采用其他名称，但会议主席 Elin Jones 感到头痛的是，迟迟达不成一致，因为他要在几周内提交名称变更的立法草案。,"AMs are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could be a headache for the Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the changes within weeks."
7977,关于改革的立法还会纳入议会运作方式的其他变更内容，包括取消 AM 资格的规则和委员会制度的设计。,"The legislation on the reforms will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system."

7981,直接投票是为了解决马其顿与邻国希腊之间长达数十年的争端问题，希腊有一个省也叫马其顿。,"The popular vote was set up in a bid to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia."
7982,雅典方面一直坚称其北部邻国的名字意味着希腊对其领土具有合法权利，并多次拒绝马其顿加入欧盟 (EU) 和北大西洋公约组织 (NATO)。,Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to its membership bids for the EU and NATO.
7983,马其顿总统奥尔基·伊万诺夫 (Gjorge Ivanov) 是此次更名公民投票的反对者，他表示不会参与投票。,"Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will disregard the vote."
7984,然而，包括总理佐兰·扎埃夫 (Zoran Zaev) 在内的公投支持者们认为，更名不过是加入欧盟 (EU) 和北大西洋公约组织 (NATO) 所要付出的必然代价。,"However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO."
7985,哈萊姆区的教堂岌岌可危，圣马丁教堂的钟声陷入沉寂,The Bells of St. Martin's Fall Silent as Churches in Harlem Struggle
7986,“历史上我曾经约谈过的老人们都说，每个角落都会有一家酒吧和一座教堂，”亚当斯 (Adams) 说到。,"""Historically, the old people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,"" Mr. Adams said."
7987,“如今，这里既没有酒吧，也没有教堂。”,"""Today, there's neither."""
7988,他说酒吧的消失是情理之中的。,He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.
7989,“如今，人们开始以不同的方式参与社交”，亚当斯表示。,"""People socialize in a different way"" nowadays, he said."
7990,“酒吧不再是人们定期光顾的街区客厅。”,"""Bars are no longer neighborhood living rooms where people go on a regular basis."""
7991,至于教堂，他担心出售资产的资金并不会支撑到如领导人们预期的那样持久，“资金迟早会归零”。,"As for churches, he worries that the money from selling assets will not last as long as leaders expect it to, ""and sooner or later they'll be right back where they started."""
7992,他补充道，教堂将被公寓大楼所取代，而公寓中住着的是那些不会帮助维护街区剩余避难所的人们。,"Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people who will not help the neighborhood's remaining sanctuaries."
7993,“在这些建筑中购买公寓的绝大多数都将是白人”，他说道，“因此，这也将加速教堂的全面关闭，因为大多数搬进这些公寓的人们不太可能会成为教堂的成员”。,"""The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,"" he said, ""and therefore will hasten the day that these churches close altogether because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches."""
7994,这两座教堂均在圣马丁教堂建成十年后，哈萊姆区成为黑人都市（1870 年的都会社区）之前由白人会众建造。,"Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later."
7995,最初的白人卫理公会会众于 20 世纪 30 年代迁出。,The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
7996,在附近做礼拜的一名黑人会众获得了这座建筑的所有权。,A black congregation that had been worshiping nearby took title to the building.
7997,在约翰·霍华德·约翰逊 (John Howard Johnson) 牧师的领导下，圣马丁教堂被一名黑人会众接管，约翰逊牧师曾领导一场抵制 125 街 (125 Street) 零售商的运动，125 街是哈萊姆区一条主要的购物街，但是拒绝雇用或提拔黑人。,"St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting blacks."
7998,1939 年的一场大火对建筑造成严重损毁，但是由于约翰逊教父的教区居民计划重建教堂，他们顺便委托制造了钟琴。,"A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild, they commissioned the carillon."
7999,约翰逊教父的儿子，圣马丁教堂的继承人大卫·约翰逊 (David Johnson) 牧师傲慢地将钟琴称为“穷人的铃声”。,"The Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon ""the poor people's bells."""
8000,在七月曾演奏钟琴的专业人士却将其称为：“文化瑰宝”和“无可取代的历史性乐器”。,"The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: ""A cultural treasure"" and ""an irreplaceable historical instrument."""
8001,这位专业人士，密歇根大学的 Tiffany Ng 还指出，这是世界上第一台由黑人乐师演奏的钟琴，这位乐师名为 Dionisio A. Lind，18 年前搬到河滨教堂演奏更大的钟琴。,"The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago."
8002,梅利韦瑟 (Merriweather) 称圣马丁教堂并没有找人取代他的位置。,Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
8003,过去几个月圣马丁教堂发生的事情是一个有关建筑师和承包商的复杂故事，这些建筑师和承包商的其中一些是由教堂的俗世领导人带来的，另一些是由主教教区带来的。,"What has played out at St. Martin's over the last few months has been a complicated tale of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese."
8004,教区的管理机构（教区委员会，由俗世领导人组成）曾在七月时给教区写信，表示担心“教区试图将资本转嫁给教区委员会”，尽管教区委员并会没有参与雇用教区递送过来的建筑师和承包商。,"The vestry - the parish's governing body, made up of lay leaders - wrote the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese ""would seek to pass along the costs"" to the vestry, even though the vestry had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese sent in."
8005,一些教区居民抱怨称教区行事方面缺乏透明度。,Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the diocese's part.

8010,哈梅尔说，开始他以为男童是因为抓到龙虾太过兴奋，但后来他“意识到男童在大喊，‘我被咬了！,"Hammel said at first he thought it was just excitement of catching a lobster, but then he ""realized that he was yelling, 'I got bit!"
8011,我被咬了！’,I got bit!'
8012,他的整个锁骨都被撕开了”，哈梅尔说他一到男童身边就注意到了。,"His whole clavicle was ripped open,"" Hammel said he noticed once he got to the boy."
8013,“我呼喊大家把他拉出水面：‘水里有鲨鱼！’”哈梅尔又说到。,"""I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'"" Hammel added."
8014,男孩被空运到圣地亚哥雷迪儿童医院 (Rady Children's Hospital)，目前情况危急。,The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is listed in critical condition.

8016,救生员拉里·贾尔斯 (Larry Giles) 上尉在新闻发布会上表示，几周前在该地区发现了一条鲨鱼，但已确定不会对人类构成危险。,"Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined not to be a dangerous species of shark."
8017,贾尔斯补充到，受害者的上半身受到创伤。,Giles added the victim sustained traumatic injuries to his upper torso area.

8020,Sainsbury's计划进军英国美容市场,Sainsbury's plans push into UK beauty market
8021,塞恩斯伯里百货公司 (Sainsbury’s) 要采用博姿 (Boots)、Superdrug 和德本汉姆百货公司 (Debenhams) 的百货公司风格，开设配备专业助理的美容通道。,"Sainsbury's is taking on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty aisles staffed with specialist assistants."
8022,随着大量百货公司进军英国价值 28 亿英镑的美容市场，而且在时尚和家居用品销售回落期间，这一市场仍在持续增长而，将在全国 11 家商铺进行美容通道测试，如果测试成功，则将在明年推广到更多店铺。,"As part of a substantial push into the UK's £2.8bn beauty market, which is continuing to grow while fashion and homeware sales fall back, the larger beauty aisles will be tested out in 11 stores around the country and taken to more stores next year if it proves a success."
8023,由于超市的电视机、微波炉和家居用品货架一度被起诉，超市决定投资美容产品，利用这些货架空间。,"The investment in beauty comes as supermarkets hunt for ways to use up shelf space once sued for TVs, microwaves and homeware."
8024,塞恩斯伯里百货公司表示，将把美容产品的规模扩大一倍，推出 3000 多种产品，包括露华浓 (Revlon)、Essie、Tweezerman 和 Dr. PawPaw 等品牌。,"Sainsbury's said it would be doubling the size of its beauty offering to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time."
8025,欧莱雅 (L’oreal)、美宝莲 (Maybelline) 和伯特蜂 (Burt's Bees) 等现有品牌也将获得更大的空间，拥有与 Boots 等商店类似的品牌区域。,"Existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those found in shops like Boots."
8026,这家超市还重新推出了自己的精品化妆品系列，以使大多数产品都是纯素食产品——这是越来越多的年轻购物者的要求所在。,The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
8027,此外，香水零售商 Fragrance Shop 将在塞恩斯伯里的两家门店进行特许经营试营业。第一家上周在伦敦南部的克罗伊登 (Croydon) 开店，另一家将于今年年末，在伯明翰的 Selly Oak 开业。,"In addition, perfume retailer the Fragrance Shop will be testing out concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week while a second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year."
8028,当前的主打趋势是网上购物，以及每天在当地便利店购买少量食品，这就意味着，超市必须采取更多措施，吸引人们前来光顾。,Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food daily at local convenience stores means supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to visit.
8029,塞恩斯伯里百货公司首席执行官迈克·库普 (Mike Coupe) 表示，这家连锁超市会提供更多服务和非食品来反击折扣商阿尔迪 (Aldi) 和利德尔 (Lidl)，这些门店将越来越像百货商店。,"Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, has said the outlets will look increasingly like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against the discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food."
8030,自两年前收购这两家连锁店以来，塞恩斯伯里百货公司一直在数百家门店开设 Argos 门店，并引入了一些 Habitat。该公司表示，收购提振了杂货销售，带来了利润。,"Sainsbury's has been putting Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago, which it says has bolstered grocery sales and made the acquisitions more profitable."
8031,这家超市之前也曾尝试过改造美容和药房，但以失败告终。,The supermarket's previous attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
8032,21 世纪初，塞恩斯伯里与博姿共同试运营了一家合资企业，但在就如何从博姿超市的药店中分取收入的问题上发生争执后，双方的合作宣告结束。,"Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the tie-up ended after a row over how to split the revenues from the chemist's stores in its supermarkets."
8033,三年前，塞恩斯伯里提出了新战略，将 281 家门店的药店业务，以 1.25 亿英镑卖给了 Lloyds Pharmacy 连锁药店的所有者 Celesio。,"The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125m, three years ago."
8034,该公司表示，Lloyds Pharmacy 将在四家门店增加一系列奢侈护肤品品牌，包括 La Roche-Posay 和 Vichy，故而会在该计划中发挥重要作用。,"It said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, by adding an extended range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores."
8035,塞恩斯伯里百货公司的商业总监保罗·米尔斯-希克斯 (Paul Mills-Hicks) 说道: “我们已经改变了美容通道的外观和氛围，为客户改善了环境。”,"Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: ""We've transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers."
8036,我们还投资引入了受过特殊培训的同事，他们将在现场提供建议。,We've also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to offer advice.
8037,我们的一系列品牌都是为满足每一种需求而设计的，诱人的环境和便利的地理位置意味着我们现在是一个引人注目的美容目的地，将成为传统购物方式的一大挑战。,"Our range of brands is designed to suit every need and the alluring environment and convenient locations mean we're now a compelling beauty destination which challenges the old way of shopping."""

8045,这项业务好比是 Gwyneth Paltrow 的 Goop 品牌，原本有望让威洛比估计的 1100 万英镑的财产翻倍。,The business had been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
8046,37 岁的威洛比在 Instagram 上宣布要退出 Truly 时，琼斯正乘坐飞机从英国出发前往他的一个度假屋的路上。,"As Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce she was leaving Truly, Jones jetted out of Britain to head for one of his holiday homes."

8051,马洛总部还有整整一仓库的货物等着出售呢。“,"There is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow HQ which are ready to be sold."""
8052,专家认为，英国最具盈利潜能的《This Morning》主持人的退出，可能会给公司带来数百万美元的损失，因为公司对垫子、蜡烛到服装和家居用品等产品投入了巨额投资，此外，还可能进一步推迟市场投放的进度。,"Experts believe the departure of the This Morning presenter, who is among Britain's most bankable stars, could cost the firm millions due to hefty investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear, and the potential for further delays to its launch."
8053,这可能意味着一段长期友谊的结束。,And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
8054,如今已是三个孩子母亲的威洛比与丈夫丹·波尔文 (Dan Baldwin) 与琼斯和他的妻子 Tara Capp 已是十年的好友。,Mother-of-three Willoughby and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.

8063,“我什么也没牺牲。”,"""I didn't give up anything."""

8072,现在，这关系就不错了。”,"Now we have this great relationship."""
8073,他说，改善与金正恩关系的工作取得了积极成果，火箭测试终止，人质成功得救，美军士兵遗骸落叶归根。,"He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - ending rocket tests, helping free hostages and getting the remains of American servicemen returned home."
8074,此外，他在谈论与金正恩的关系时，为自己特殊的方法辩解称，,And he defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with Kim.

8078,尽管龙目岛有超过 10% 的人口流离失所，但政府并没有宣布发生国家灾难，而国家灾难是启动国际援助的先决条件。,"Even though more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had been dislocated, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid."
8079,“遗憾的是，在很多情况下，他们很清楚不会请求国际援助，因此这对他们而言将是一个巨大的挑战”，Sumbung 女士说到。,"""In many cases, unfortunately, they've been very clear that they're not requesting international assistance, so it's a bit challenging,"" Ms. Sumbung said."

8083,虽然亚齐已经搭建了海啸避难所，但其他海岸线并没有效仿为之。,"While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coastlines."
8084,尽管海啸预警已经生效，但巴鲁明显缺乏海啸警报，这可能是造成人员伤亡的罪魁祸首。,"The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, even though a warning had been in effect, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life."

8129,议会的克伦威尔雕像成为最后遭受“改写历史”争议的纪念碑,Parliament's statue of Cromwell becomes latest memorial hit by 'rewriting history' row
8130,克伦威尔狂热的清教徒追随者们曾对英国文化和宗教文物进行塔利班式的破坏，放逐可谓是应得的惩罚。,Its banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artefacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
8131,但克伦威尔学会称克里克 (Crick) 的建议“极为愚蠢”且“试图改写历史”。,"But the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's suggestion as ""folly"" and ""attempting to rewrite history."""
8132,克伦威尔学会主席，约翰·金史密斯 (John Goldsmith) 表示：“目前在有关移除雕像的争论中，位于西敏宫外的奥利弗·克伦威尔 (Oliver Cromwell) 的雕像无疑会成为攻击目标。,"John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: ""It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target."
8133,英国内战的破坏偶像主义运动既不是克伦威尔指挥的，也不是克伦威尔发动的。,The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
8134,或许克伦威尔最大的错误就是成为其先人托马斯上个世纪的所作所为的牺牲品。,Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
8135,威廉·哈默·托尔内克罗夫特 (William Hamo Thorneycroft) 爵士对克伦威尔的高调称赞很好地证明了 19 世纪的主张，也是很多人认为仍值得庆贺的克伦威尔史学的一部分。,Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure who many believe is still worth celebrating.
8136,金史密斯向《星期日电讯报》透露：“克伦威尔被很多人认为是国会抵抗外部压力（就他而言，也就是君主制）的捍卫者，如今这么认为的人可能会少于 19 世纪晚期。,"Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: ""Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy."
8137,这一表述是否完全准确，一直是历史争论的主题。,Whether that is a wholly accurate representation is the subject of continuing historical debate.
8138,但可以肯定的是，17 世纪中期的冲突影响了我们国家后来的发展，克伦威尔是一个因代表分裂的一方而获得认可的人物。,"What is certain is that the conflict of the mid 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognisable figure who represents one side of that divide."
8139,他作为护国公所取得的成就也值得庆祝和纪念的。”,"His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."""

8144,据报道，该养猪户及其堂兄周三从邻省云南赶到当地市场来售卖 15 头猪。,He had reportedly travelled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
8145,第二天早上，他的堂兄发现该养猪户已经死亡，并且临近猪舍的门开着。,"The following morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered a door to a neighbouring pig sty open."
8146,他介绍称，那间猪圈里有一头体型较大的公猪，嘴里满是鲜血。,He said that in the sty was a large male pig with blood on its mouth.
8147,据报道，经法医鉴定证实，那只 550 磅的肥猪将该农民袭击致死。,"A forensic examination confirmed that the 550 pound hog had mauled the farmer to death, according to the report."
8148,援引《贵阳晚间新闻》消息，“我堂弟的腿部血肉模糊，惨不忍睹”，吴姓堂兄说到。,"""My cousin's legs were bloody and mangled,"" the cousin, referred to by his surname ""Wu,"" said, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News."
8149,监控录像显示，袁姓男子于周四早上 4：40 分进入市场喂猪。,Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 am Thursday to feed his pigs.
8150,而他的尸体在大约一小时之后被发现。,His body was found about an hour later.
8151,但是致其死亡的肥猪既不属于袁姓男子也不属于其堂兄。,The animal who killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
8152,市场管理员向《晚间新闻》透露，这只肥猪已经被锁了起来，防止其再次攻击他人，同时警方正在现场收集证据。,"A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the scene."
8153,据报道，袁姓男子的家人和市场当局正在协商其死亡赔偿问题。,Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
8154,尽管较为罕见，但之前也曾报道过猪攻击人类的事件。,"Though rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before."
8155,2016 年，在马萨诸塞州的一家农场，一头猪攻击了一名妇女和她的丈夫，致使二人受重伤。,"In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with critical injuries."
8156,十年前，一只 650 磅的肥猪将威尔士一名农户按在拖拉机上，直至他的妻子赶来把这只牲畜吓跑。,"Ten years previously, a 650 pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife scared the animal away."
8157,2012 年，俄勒冈州的一名农户被自己的猪吞掉，马尼托巴湖的一名农户向加拿大广播公司新闻网 (CBC News) 透露称，猪通常不具有攻击性，但是血液的味道可以起到“触发剂”的作用。,"After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive but the taste of blood can act as a ""trigger."""
8158,“它们只是喜欢嬉戏打闹。,"""They're just being playful."
8159,它们像孩子一样，充满好奇......它们并没有想伤害你。,"They're nippers, very inquisitive ... they aren't out to hurt you."
8160,你只需要给予它们适当的尊重”，他说到。,"You just have to pay them the right amount of respect,"" he said."
8161,飓风残余“罗莎”将继续为美国西南部带来大范围暴雨,Hurricane Rosa's remnants to bring widespread heavy rain to southwest US
8162,"飓风""罗莎"" (Rosa) 继续向墨西哥北海岸移动，如预报所示，在抵达这块凉爽的海域后，风势有所减弱。","As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico."
8163,但预计在未来几天时间，罗莎还会给墨西哥北部及美国西南部带来大范围的暴雨和闪洪。,"However, Rosa will bring flooding rains across northern Mexico and the southwest U.S. over the coming days."
8164,周日东部时间早上 5 点，“罗莎”的中心位于墨西哥 Punta Eugenia 西南 385 英里，风速为 85 英里/小时，属于 1 级飓风。,"Rosa had winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 Hurricane, as of 5 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico."
8165,预计“罗莎”将于周日继续北上。,Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
8166,与此同时，太平洋上开始形成低谷，向东移向美国西海岸。“罗莎”将于周一形成热带风暴，靠近下加利福尼亚半岛，届时，深层热带湿气将向北进军美国西南部。,"Meanwhile, a trough is beginning to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move east toward the West Coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm it will begin to push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwest U.S."
8167,周一，“罗莎”将为墨西哥部分地区带来 10 英寸的降雨量。,Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
8168,之后，热带湿气与即将到来的波谷相互作用，将在未来几天内，在西南地区造成大范围强降雨。,"Then, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching trough will create widespread heavy rainfall in the Southwest over the coming days."
8169,就当地而言，1 至 4 英寸的降雨量便会造成洪水泛滥、泥石流，甚至可能导致沙漠发生山体滑坡。,"Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash flooding, debris flows and possibility landslides in the desert."

8171,预计西南部分地区的降雨量将达 2 至 4 英寸，特别是在亚利桑那州的大部分地区。,"As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the Southwest, especially over much of Arizona."
8172,由于热带雨具有分散性，伴随条件的快速恶化，可能会出现洪水泛滥。,Flash flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
8173,由于热带降雨的威胁，沙漠冒险活动将十分危险。,It would be extremely ill advised to venture out into the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rainfall.
8174,大雨可能导致峡谷形成湍急的河流，雷雨会带来局部阵风和飞尘。,Heavy rain could cause canyons to become raging rivers and thunderstorms will bring locally gusty winds and blowing dust.
8175,即将抵达的波谷，将给南加州海岸的部分地区带来局部大雨。,The approaching trough will bring some locally heavy rain to parts of the Southern California coastline.
8176,降雨总量可能会超过半英寸，这可能会导致轻微泥石流和道路打滑。,"Rainfall totals of over half an inch are possible, which could cause minor debris flows and slick roadways."
8177,这将是该地区进入雨季以来的第一场降雨。,This would be the region's first rainfall of their wet season.
8178,周日晚间及周一早上，亚利桑那州将迎来分散性热带阵雨，之后，周一晚间及周二的降雨范围将扩大。,"Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread late Monday and Tuesday."
8179,大雨将在周二蔓延到 Four Corners，并将一直持续到周三。,Heavy rain will spread into the Four Corners on Tuesday and last through Wednesday.
8180,由于北极变冷，而热带地区仍然相当温暖，十月，美国各地的温度将经历剧烈波动。,"October can see some intense temperature swings across the U.S. as the Arctic gets cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm."
8181,这种情况有时会导致短距离内，温度发生剧烈变化。,Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
8182,周日，美国中部便会出现巨大温差。,There is a great example of dramatic temperature differences through the central U.S. on Sunday.

8190,与此同时，政治僵局仍在继续，广播公司打乱了周五最后转折的常规节目：亚利桑那州参议员杰夫·弗莱克 (Jeff Flake) 答应会要求 FBI 对指控进行为期一周的调查。,"Meanwhile, the political standoff continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for Friday's last-minute twist: an agreement engineered by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of the charges."
8191,福特向参议院司法委员会介绍称，自己百分百肯定卡瓦诺在高中派对上喝醉后，摸自己的身体，想脱掉她的衣服。,Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh groped her drunkenly and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
8192,卡瓦诺则慷慨激昂地回应称，他百分百肯定没有发生过这种情事。,"Kavanaugh, in impassioned testimony, said he's 100 percent certain that it didn't happen."
8193,尼尔森公司上周五报道，可能会有超过 2040 万人观看这场听证会。,It's likely that more than the 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watched it.
8194,该公司正在计算 CBS、ABC、NBC、CNN、福克斯新闻频道和、MSNBC、的平均收视率。,"The company was counting average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC."
8195,其他同时播出了这场听证会情况的网络的收视数据尚未获得，包括 PBS、C-SPAN 和 Fox Business Network。,"Figures weren't immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network."
8196,尼尔森公司在统计办公室观看节目人数方面，时常会遇到一些麻烦。,And Nielsen usually has some trouble measuring people who watch in offices.
8197,客观来看，这个数字好比季后赛足球比赛或奥斯卡奖的观众规模。,"To put that in perspective, that's an audience size similar to that for a playoff football game or the Academy Awards."
8198,尼尔森表示，福克斯新闻频道在听证会当天的全天收视人数达 569 万，力压其他网络媒体。福克斯新闻频道的观点主持人是任命卡瓦诺的有力支持者。,"Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts have strongly backed Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing, Nielsen said."
8199,ABC 位居其后，收视人数为 326 万。,ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
8200,尼尔森统计，CBS 的收视人数为 310 万，NBC 为 294 万，MSNBC 为 289 万，CNN 为 252 万。,"CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said."
8201,听证会结束后，关注度仍居高不下。,Interest remained high after the hearing.
8202,弗莱克 成为了周五节目的核心人物。,Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
8203,先前，这位温和的共和党人，在办公室发表声明表示他将投票支持卡瓦诺。周五早上，他在登上电梯前往司法委员会听证会时，被 CNN 和 CBS 的摄像机拍摄到，抗议者对其开口大骂。,"After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would be voting in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught be CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning being shouted at by protesters as he tried to ride an elevator to a Judiciary Committee hearing."
8204,CNN 现场直播中看到，他在被谴责期间，目光低垂，沉默不语地站了几分钟。,"He stood with eyes downcast for several minutes as he was berated, televised live on CNN."
8205,一位女人说道：“我就正在你的面前。”,"""I'm standing right here in front of you,"" one woman said."
8206,“你觉得他对国人所说的是事实吗？”,"""Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
8207,“你大权在握，而这么多的女性却无能为力。”,"He was told, ""you have power when so many women are powerless."""""
8208,在电梯关闭之前，弗莱克称，他的办公室发表了一份声明，自己将在委员会听证会上发表更多言论。,"Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing."
8209,有线电视和广播网络都在直播后续的情况，司法委员会将投票将卡瓦诺的提名，送往参议院进行全体投票。,"The cable and broadcast networks were all covering live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote."
8210,但弗莱克表示，只有 FBI 在下周对涉及该候选人性侵的指控做进一步调查的情况下，他才会举行投票。而少数民主党也人一直在敦促对其进行进一步调查。,"But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would look into the allegations against the nominee for the next week, which minority Democrats have been urging."
8211,在与朋友民主党参议员克里斯·库恩 (Chris Coons) 的对话后，弗拉克在一定程度上对此深信不疑。,"Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons."
8212,在与库恩和几位参议员的对话后，弗拉克作出了决定。,"After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision."
8213,弗莱克的选择力度很大，因为显然，如果不进行调查，共和党人是不会投选票批准卡瓦诺的。,"Flake's choice had power, because it was evident Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation."
8214,特朗普已经向联邦调查局签发命令对卡瓦诺法官进行补充调查。,President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
8215,英国首相特雷莎·梅指责脱欧问题的评论家们“玩政治游戏”,British PM May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit

8218,在该报头版的另一则采访中，前英国外交大臣鲍里斯·约翰逊 (Boris Johnson) 对其所谓的脱欧契克斯计划进行了强烈抨击，并表示，英国和欧盟应该彼此向对方征收关税的这一提议“实属荒谬”。,"In another interview next to the one with her on the newspaper's front page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson pressed his attack of her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was ""entirely preposterous."""

8268,多利·蒙加 (Dolly Menga) 的进球成了关键决胜之球，加里·霍尔特 (Gary Holt) 的球队在第二节追平了爱尔兰队 (Hibernian)。,Dolly Menga's strike proved to be the difference as Gary Holt's side moved level with Hibernian in second.

8272,利文斯顿队很是怀念与强敌客队对抗的机会,Livingston miss chances against blunt visitors
8273,霍尔特的球队在得分之前就已经有了领先的迹象，他们的进攻给流浪者带来了各种各样的问题。,"Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, with their directness causing Rangers all manner of problems."
8274,斯科特·罗宾逊 (Scott Robinson) 虽然突破了防守，却将球踢到了球门的另一边，阿兰·利思戈 (Alan Lithgow) 在接到克雷格·哈尔科特 (Craig Halkett) 的头球后，被拖到了边路。,"Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his effort across the face of goal, then Alan Lithgow could only direct his effort wide after sliding in to meet Craig Halkett's header across goal."
8275,东道主非常愿意与流浪者队比赛，因为他们知道可以在定位球时，给客队制造麻烦。,"The hosts were content to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could trouble the visitors at set pieces."
8276,关键性的射门就是这样产生的。,And that was the manner in which the crucial goal came.
8277,游骑兵队丢了一个任意球，利文斯顿队开了一个空位，德克兰加拉格尔和罗宾逊一起组建了蒙加，后者从禁区中心接过一记得分。流浪者队丢了一个任意球，利文斯顿队破门，德克兰·加拉格尔 (Declan Gallagher) 和罗宾逊联手围堵蒙加。蒙加在禁区中央触球得分。,"Rangers conceded a free-kick and Livingston worked an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combining to set up Menga, who took a touch and scored from the centre of the box."
8278,这时，流浪者队虽然掌握了控球权，却发现主队防守难以突破，守门员利亚姆凯利 (Liam Kelly) 基本上没什么可担忧的，,"By that stage, Rangers had dominated possession but had found the home defence impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely untroubled,"
8279,这种模式一直持续到下半场，尽管阿尔弗雷多·莫雷洛斯 (Alfredo Morelos) 从凯利脚下抢到了一球。,"That pattern continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos did force a save from Kelly."
8280,斯科特·皮特曼 (Scott Pittman) 被流浪者队门将阿兰·麦格雷戈 (Allan McGregor) 一脚挡出，利思戈将利文斯顿队的另一个定位球踢偏。,Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow flicked wide from another Livingston set play.

8284,利文斯顿队表现超凡，成绩惊人。,A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
8285,全体球员的表现都十分优秀，再一次超越了人们的期望。,"To a man, they were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory."
8286,自从霍尔特重返顶级联赛以来，这支球队的比赛风格和人员配置几乎没有什么变化，但霍尔特给球队带来的荣誉确实值得称道。,"Their style of play and personnel has scarcely changed since their return to the top flight, but great credit has to go to Holt for the way he has galvanised the team since his arrival."
8287,他带出了很多英雄般的球员。,He had so many heroes.
8288,队长哈尔科特功不可没，他部署了组织性超强的防守阵容，而蒙加在整个过程中，让康纳·戈德森 (Connor Goldson) 和乔·沃拉尔 (Joe Worrall) 未曾放下过提防。,"Captain Halkett was immense, marshalling a superbly-organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout."
8289,不过，流浪者队的士气不够足。,"Rangers were short of inspiration, though."
8290,他们在杰拉德的带领下，偶尔表现尚佳，但远没有达到标准。,"As good as they have been at times under Gerrard, they fell well short of those standards."
8291,他们的最后一球没有踢进——他们只切入了主队一次——这对处于中游的流浪者队来说，可谓一个警钟。,"Their final ball was lacking - only once did they cut the home side open - and it is something of a wake-up call for Rangers, who find themselves in mid-table."

8377,由于没有告知广大民众海啸袭击了巴鲁，该机构于周六受到了广泛的批评，尽管官员们称，海啸发生在警报发布之后。,"The agency on Saturday was widely criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, though officials said waves had come within the time the warning was issued."

8432,此番言论针对的是美国政府各部门作出的 AI 公告，美国总体上，缺少正式的人工智能战略。,"The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have made AI announcements, even as the U.S. overall lacks a formal AI strategy."
8433,而中国去年却推出了一项计划：力争在 2030 年，成为人工智能创新的老大。,"Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it's aiming to be No.1 in AI innovation by 2030."
8434,“在这一领域，所有其他国家都远远落后于美国，而我们正在寻找人工智能的新突破，所以，人工智能研究预算加倍将是一个良好的开端”，Lee 介绍道。,"""Double the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so much farther behind U.S., and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI,"" said Lee."

8451,马其顿人民周日举行全民公投，以表决是否将国名改为“北马其顿共和国”，此举将解决马其顿与希腊之间长达数十年的争端问题，希腊曾阻止其加入欧盟和北大西洋公约组织 (NATO)。,"The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to ""Republic of North Macedonia,"" a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece which had blocked its membership bids for the European Union and NATO."
8452,希腊有一个省也叫马其顿，保留着北部邻国的名字意味着希腊对其领土具有合法权利，并曾否决其加入北大西洋公约组织 (NATO) 和欧盟 (EU)。,"Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entrance into NATO and the EU."
8453,两国政府于六月份就拟议的新国名称达成协议，但民族主义反对者认为，更改国名将危害马其顿斯拉夫多数人口的种族认同。,"The two governments struck a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population."

8456,包括总理佐兰·扎埃夫 (Zoran Zaev) 在内的更名支持者们认为，马其顿是南斯拉夫解体衍生的国家之一，寻求加入欧盟 (EU) 和北大西洋公约组织 (NATO) 等机构值得付出一定的代价。,"Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to pursue admission into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia."
8457,“我今天来投票是为了国家的未来，为了马其顿的年轻一代，这样他们就可以在欧盟的保护伞下自由生活，因为这意味着我们所有人都能过上更安全的生活”，斯科普里 79 岁的奥利维拉·乔治耶夫斯卡 (Olivera Georgijevska) 说到。,"""I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so they can be live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,"" said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje."
8458,虽然没有受到法律约束，也有足够的议会议员表示他们会果断遵守投票结果。,"Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will abide by the vote's outcome to make it decisive."
8459,但更名需要获得议会三分之二多数投票。,The name change would requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
8460,州选举委员会表示，截至下午 1 时，尚未收到任何不法行为报告。,The state election commission said there had been no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.

8464,在斯科普里议会门前，54 岁的 Vladimir Kavardarkov 正在准备小型舞台，并把椅子挪到由抵制公投的人们搭建的帐篷前。,"In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and pulling up chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum."
8465,“虽然是为了北大西洋公约组织 (NATO) 和欧盟 (EU)，但是我们想挺胸抬头地加入，而不是通过走后门”，Kavardarkov 说到。,"""We are for NATO and EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the service door"" Kavadarkov said."
8466,“我们国家虽然贫穷，但是我们有尊严。,"""We are a poor country, but we do have dignity."
8467,如果他们不把我们当成马其顿人，我们可以求助于其他国家，如中国或俄罗斯，成为亚欧一体化成员”。,"If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia integration."""
8468,总体扎埃夫表示北大西洋公约组织 (NATO) 的成员身份将为失业率高达 20% 以上的马其顿带来大量所需的投资。,"Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent."
8469,“我相信大多数人多会支持公投，因为我们 80% 以上的民众都支持北大西洋公约组织 (NATO) 和欧盟 (EU)”，扎埃夫投票后表示。,"""I believe the huge majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of EU and NATO,"" Zaev said after casting his ballot."
8470,他说“支持”的投票结果将“确定我们的未来”。,"He said that a ""yes"" result would be ""confirmation of our future."""
8471,马其顿政策研究所上周一公布的民意调查显示，30% 到 43% 的选民将参加公投 - 而这一数字则低于所需的投票率。,A poll published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - below the required turnout.
8472,马其顿 Telma TV 的另一项民意调查发现，57% 的调查对象称计划参与周日的投票。,"Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found 57 percent of respondents planning to vote on Sunday."
8473,当然，70% 的民众表示他们将投出支持票。,"Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes."
8474,公投若要取得成功，投票率须达到 50% 加一票。,For the referendum to be successful turnout needs to be 50 percent plus one vote.
8475,公投失败意味着亲西方政府的政策将遭遇自去年五月上台以来的首次严重打击。,A failure in the referendum would represent the first serious blow to policy of the pro-Western government since it took over in May last year.

8498,求胜心切的谢泽尔希望在周日对阵科罗拉多落矶队的比赛中担任首发，但前提是落矶队仍沉浸在季后赛的影响中，落矶队较国家联盟 (NL) 西区的洛杉矶道奇队领先一场。,"But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who hold a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West."
8499,周五晚上，落矶队以 5-2 战胜了国民队，锁定了至少一个外卡名额，但他们仍然希望拿下首个分区冠军。,"The Rockies clinched at least a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to lock up their first division title."
8500,“即使不为别的，至少我们能够在万众瞩目的丹佛参与比赛，而其他球队也将打出我今年将面临的最高水平。,"""Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can be able to toe the rubber knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team would be playing at probably the highest level of any point I would face this year."
8501,我怎么会不愿意参加比赛呢？”,"Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"""
8502,国民队还没有宣布周日的首发阵容，但是据报道称，在这种情况下他们很可能让谢泽尔投球。,"The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to let Scherzer pitch in such a situation."
8503,这将是谢泽尔的第 34 次首发，他已经于周四开始在牛棚练投，将在正常休息的周日投球。,"Scherzer, who would be making his 34th start, threw a bullpen session on Thursday and would be pitching on his normal rest Sunday."
8504,这位华盛顿的右手球员在本赛季的 222 又 2/3 局中，取得了 18 胜 7 败的成绩，防御率为 2.53，得到 300 个三振。,The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
8505,特朗普在西弗吉尼亚州举行集会,Trump rallies in West Virginia
8506,总统在谈到共和党选情在中期选举中的重要性时，间接影射他选中的最高法院选民布雷特·卡瓦诺 (Brett Kavanaugh) 所面临的处境。,The President obliquely referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
8507,“我们所做的一切关乎 11 月份的走向。,"""All of what we've done is at stake in November."
8508,距离我们一生中最重要的一次选举，还有五周的时间。,Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetimes.
8509,这次事关重大，我不是在竞选，我这样四处奔波，就是为了能让你们选出优秀的候选人”，他说道。,"This is one of the big, big -- I'm not running but I'm really running that's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates,"" he said."
8510,特朗普继续说道，“你们也看到了，民主党人是多么可怕，你们现在就能看到。,"Trump continued, ""You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now."
8511,他们决心要使用任何必要的手段夺回权力，你们能看到他们的卑鄙肮脏。,"And they're determined to take back power by using any means necessary, you see the meanness, the nastiness."
8512,他们不管会伤到什么人，为了掌控权力，拿到控制权，把谁踩到脚下，这他们都无所谓，他们眼里只有权力和控制权，而我们是不会给他们的。”,"They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over in order to get power and control, that's what they want is power and control, we're not going to give it to them."""
8513,民主党肩负的使命就是“抵抗和阻挠”。,"Democrats, he said, are on a mission to ""resist and obstruct."""
8514,“你们在过去的四天里看到了这一点，”他说道。他称民主党“愤怒、可耻、卑鄙、虚伪”。,"""And you see that over the last four days,"" he said, calling the Democrats ""angry and mean and nasty and untruthful."""
8515,他提到参议院司法委员会 (Senate Judiciary Committee) 民主党参议员黛安·范斯坦 (Dianne Feinstein) 的名字，引得现场一片唏嘘。,"He referenced Senate Judiciary Committee ranking Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein by name, which received loud boos from the audience."
8516,“还记得她是怎么回答的吗？,"""Remember her answer?"
8517,是你泄露的文件吗？,Did you leak the document?
8518,呃，呃，什么。,"Uh, uh, what."
8519,不是，呃，不是，别人给我的，这种肢体语言太拙劣了，是我见过的最拙劣的肢体语言。”,"No, uh no, I wait one - that was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."""
8520,工党不再是广教派。,Labour is no longer a broad church.
8521,这里容不得直言的人,It is intolerant of those who speak their minds
8522,当地 Momentum 政党的积极分子投票谴责我时，我一点都没觉得奇怪。,"When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to censure me, it was hardly a surprise."
8523,毕竟，我工党议员中，最后得知自己并不受人欢迎的议员，而不受欢迎的原因，就是因为我们表达自己的想法。,"After all, I'm the latest in a line of Labour MPs to be told we are not welcome - all for speaking our minds."
8524,我的议会同事 Joan Ryan 由于坚决反对反犹太主义，也受到了类似的待遇。,My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she resolutely stood up to antisemitism.
8525,而针对我的动议批评，是因为我反对 Jeremy Corbyn。,"In my case, the censure motion criticised me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn."
8526,讽刺的是，在有关负责任的经济政策、国家安全和欧洲问题上，都出现了类似的问题，在这类问题中，Jeremy 与之前的领导人持反对意见。,"On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders."
8527,周五诺丁汉东部工党会议的通知中介绍道，“我们希望会议具有包容性，能取得富有成效的结果。”,"The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that ""we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."""
8528,在我担任当地工党议员的这八年里，大部分时间，星期五晚上的 GC 会议都是这个样子。,"For most of my eight years as the local Labour MP, the Friday night GC meetings have been exactly that."
8529,"不幸的是，如今，这已经不再是诸多会议的基调，人们早已经忘了“向善，温和” (kinder, gentler) 的政治诺言，甚至似乎都未曾开始践行过。","Sadly today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of ""kinder, gentler"" politics has long been forgotten if, indeed, it ever began."
8530,工党不能容忍相左的观点，所有观点的评判基础都是工党领袖是否接受。这样的势头日渐明显。,It has become increasingly apparent that differing views are not tolerated in the Labour party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
8531,这种现象始于 Jeremy 担任工党领袖之后不久，我之前曾认为，我跟我的同僚们，都有同样政治观点，可他们开始希望我转变观点，让我站在我绝不会认同的立场，无论是在国家安全问题上，还是在欧盟单一市场的问题上。,"This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I had previously thought I shared a similar political outlook began expecting me to do a U-turn and take positions I would never have otherwise agreed with - whether on national security or the EU single market."
8532,每当我公开发言，我所说的内容并不重要，随之而来的便是社交媒体上的连番指责，要求取消选举，谴责中派政治，或是告诉我不配加入工党。,"Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there follows a tirade of abuse on social media calling for deselection, denouncing the politics of the centre, telling me I should not be in the Labour party."
8533,经历这种事的人，并非只有我一个人。,And that is not just my experience.
8534,事实上，我清楚自己相比有些同事而言，还算是幸运的，因为针对我的评论往往都是政治性言论。,"Indeed, I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues as the comments directed at me tend to be political."
8535,我的好多同僚们，每天都要面临洪流一般的罪名，或是使用性别歧视的侮辱性语言，或是言语具有种族主义色彩。但他们从未回避过，我佩服他们这种专业精神和坚定的决心。,I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist abuse every day but never shy away.
8536,这个政治时代最令人失望的一点，就是侮辱语言成为了一种常态。,One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how levels of abuse have become normalised.
8537,Jeremy Corbyn 上周称，工党应该营造一种宽容的文化氛围。,Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should foster a culture of tolerance.
8538,事实是，我们不再是有着多种声音的大教会，而且，一个又一个的“不信任”动议，一条又一条的选拔规定的改变，让工党变得更加狭隘。,"The reality is we are no longer that broad church and with every ""no-confidence"" motion or change of selection rules the party becomes narrower."
8539,在过去的两年里，我收到了很多建议，力劝我保持低调，不要那么直言不讳，这样我才能“独善其身”。,"I have had lots of advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head down, not to be so vocal and then I would ""be all right."""
8540,可这不是我从政的初衷。,But that is not what I came into politics to do.
8541,32 年前，在我还是一名在校学生的时候，我加入了工党。当时，由于撒切尔政府的疏忽，我们综合学校课堂基本陷入瘫痪，从那时起，无论是作为议员，还是政府大臣，我都竭尽全力，为最需要公共服务的人，谋求更好的公共服务。,"Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school pupil, provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect that had left my comprehensive school classroom literally falling down, I've sought to champion better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or government minister."
8542,我从未隐瞒过我的政治，包括在上次大选中。,"I have never hidden my politics, including at the last election."
8543,对于我的政策立场以及我与现任领导存在分歧的领域，诺丁汉东区的任何人都不会觉得奇怪。,No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
8544,对于在周五提出议案的人，我要说的是，我不明白，在我们的国家努力实现脱欧，损害我们的家庭、企业和公共服务之时，你们还在浪费时间和精力，声伐我是否忠诚于工党领袖。,"To those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I would say is that when the country is ploughing towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour party leader."
8545,其实，我想对我的选民（无论是否属于工党成员），而非诺丁汉 Momentum，说的一句话是：能为你们服务我荣幸备至，我保证，任何阻止当选的威胁或政治私利，都无法阻止我按照我觉得最符合你们所有人权益的方式行事。,"But really the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of deselection threats or political expediency will deter me from acting in what I believe are the best interests of you all."

8547,艾尔联 38-17 力克梅尔罗斯：不败艾尔联再次获胜,Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeaten Ayr go top
8548,最后的两次尝试可能在某些程度上影响了最终的结果，但毫无疑问，在这场妙趣横生的比赛中获胜，艾尔联可谓是当之无愧。,"Two late tries may have skewed the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully-entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day."
8549,他们现在位居榜首，是十支球队中唯一一支不败的球队。,"They now top the table, the only unbeaten side of the ten."
8550,最终，他们出色的防守以及超乎寻常的机会把握，令主队和教练彼得·默基 (Peter Murchie) 很是满意。,"In the end, it was their superior defence, as much as their better chance-taking, which carried the home side and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased."
8551,“我们经历了比赛的重重考验，但到目前为止仍保持着不败的战绩，为此我必须感到高兴”，默基表示。,"""We've been tested over our games this far, and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,"" he said."
8552,梅尔罗斯队的罗宾·克里斯蒂 (Robyn Christie) 表示：“荣誉属于艾尔联，他们比我们更好地把握住了机遇”。,"Robyn Christie of Melrose said: ""Credit to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did."""
8553,格兰特·安德森 (Grant Anderson) 在第 14 分钟的尝试使艾尔联暂时领先，随后被弗雷泽·克里莫 (Frazier Climo) 换下，但是由于在对抗勇士队的比赛中苏格兰队员罗里·休斯 (Hughes) 遭遇黄牌，使得梅尔罗斯队在人数上占据优势，而贾森·巴格特 (Jason Baggot) 则抓住了没有被换下场的机会。,"Grant Anderson's 14th minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but, a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, released for the game by Warriors, allowed Melrose to make numbers tell and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted try."
8554,中场休息前，克里莫以一记点球扩大了艾尔联的领先优势，进球后，中场休息时，他获得附加分独自将比分变为 17-5。,"Climo stretched the Ayr lead with a penalty, before, right on half-time, he scored then converted a solo try to make it 17-5 to Ayr at the break."
8555,但梅尔罗斯下半场的开局表现很好，而巴格特换上的帕特里克·安德森 (Patrick Anderson) 的一记射门将比分差距缩小到了五分。,"But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, converted by Baggot, reduced the leeway to five points."
8556,随后，Ruaridh Knott 由于受伤严重，被担架抬出场外，耽搁了较长的时间，比赛重新开始后，艾尔联通过克里莫换上的斯塔福·麦克道尔 (Stafford McDowall) 的一次射门再次将比分拉大。,"There was then a lengthy hold-up for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was stretchered off, and from the restart, Ayr surged further ahead through a Stafford McDowall try, converted by Climo."
8557,随后艾尔联的代理队长布莱尔·麦克弗森 (Blair Macpherson) 遭遇黄牌警告，梅尔罗斯队在人数上再次占据优势，凭借未被换下的布鲁斯·科文 (Bruce Colvine) 的射门，打破了巨大的压力魔咒。,"Ayr acting captain Blair Macpherson was then yellow-carded, and again, Melrose made the extra man pay with an unconverted Bruce Colvine try, at the end of a spell of fierce pressure."
8558,然而主队恢复气势后，当斯特鲁安·哈钦森 (Struan Hutchinson) 因界外点球无球撞倒克里莫而被黄牌警告时，麦克弗森在艾尔联进攻队员后方持球触地得分。,"The home side came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was yellow-carded for tackling Climo without the ball, from the penalty line-out, MacPherson touched down at the back of the advancing Ayr maul."
8559,与比赛重新开始时一样，克里莫再次被换下，凯尔·罗维 (Kyle Rowe) 接到大卫·阿姆斯特朗 (David Armstrong) 的开球后，主队的第五次尝试送走了侧卫格里高尔·亨利 (Gregor Henry)。,"Climo converted, as he did again almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry away for the home side's fifth try."
8560,Still Game 主演准备进军餐饮业,Still Game star looks set for new career in restaurant industry
8561,Still Game 主演福特·基兰 (Ford Kieran) 似乎准备进军酒店业，此前曾被发现担任一家注册餐饮公司的董事。,Still Game star Ford Kieran looks set to move into the hospitality industry after it was discovered he's been named as the director of a licensed restaurants company.
8562,这位 56 岁的演员在脍炙人口的英国广播公司 (BBC) 电视剧中扮演杰克·贾维斯 (Jack Jarvis)，这部剧由他编写并与长期的喜剧搭档格雷格·亨普希尔 (Greg Hemphill) 联合主演。,"The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he writes and co-stars with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill."
8563,二人宣布，即将播出的第九季将是该剧的最后一季，而基兰似乎也在规划着效仿克雷格朗的生活。,"The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the final one in the show's run, and it appears Kiernan is planning for life after Craiglang."
8564,官方记录显示，基兰是 Adriftmorn Limited 的董事。,"According to official record listings, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited."
8565,这位演员拒绝对此事发表评论，尽管《苏格兰太阳报》一位提供消息者暗示基兰希望加入克雷格朗“红火的餐饮业”。,"The actor declined to comment on the story, though a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was looking to get involved in Glasgow's ""thriving restaurant trade."""
8566,“大海属于我们”：陆围国家玻利维亚希望法院裁定重启太平洋之路,'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen path to Pacific
8567,水手们在拉巴斯装备精良的海军总部巡查。,Sailors patrol a rigging-clad naval headquarters in La Paz.
8568,公共建筑上，一面海蓝色的旗帜迎风飘扬。,Public buildings fly an ocean-blue flag.
8569,从的的喀喀湖到亚马逊的海军基地，题满了字：“大海从法律上来说，是属于我们的。,"Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are daubed with the motto: ""The sea is ours by right."
8570,收回大海，是我们的义务。”,"To recover it is a duty."""
8571,在整个陆地包围的玻利维亚，在 19 世纪发生的一起血腥的资源冲突中，海岸线落入智利之手的记忆仍然历历在目。玻利维亚渴望再次驶向太平洋。,"Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still vivid - as is the yearning to sail the Pacific Ocean once more."
8572,这个几十年已久的希望达到了最高点，因为玻利维亚在经过五年的审议后，终于在 10 月 1 日等来了国际法院的裁决。,"Those hopes are perhaps at their highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations."
8573,玻利维亚外交官罗伯托·卡尔扎迪拉 (Roberto Calzadilla) 介绍称：“玻利维亚有动力，人民上下一心，和谐团结，自然能等来积极的结局。”,"""Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and is of course expecting with a positive view the outcome,"" said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat."
8574,国际法院将在全国各大屏幕上直播整个裁决过程，玻利维亚人可以全程观看。希望在经过几十年的时断时续的谈判后，海牙法庭能够支持玻利维亚的主张。智利有义务通过谈判授予玻利维亚一个主权出海口。,"Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ ruling on big screens across the country, hopeful that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favour of Bolivia's claim that - after decades of fitful talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate granting Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea."
8575,玻利维亚魅力超凡的总统埃沃·莫拉莱斯 (Evo Morales) 是土生土长的本土人，同样会关注周一的裁决。这位总统能否在明年的竞选中连任，颇受争议。,"Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year - also has plenty riding on Monday's ruling."
8576,他在八月底曾郑重宣布称，“我们即将重返太平洋”。,"""We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,"" he vowed in late August."
8577,但一些分析人士认为，法院不太可能作出利于玻利维亚的决定，如果真的作出这样的决定，也不会改变什么。,But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's favour - and that little would change if it did.
8578,这个总部设在荷兰的联合国机构，无权授予智利领土，而且已出台规定，不会确定可能的谈判结果。,"The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to award Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks."
8579,智利的一位国际法专家 Paz Zárate 表示，最后的辩论审理刚刚结束六个月，国际法院便进行裁决，这表明案件“并不复杂”。,"That the ICJ's ruling comes only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates the case ""wasn't complicated,"" said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law."
8580,而且过去四年丝毫没有推动玻利维亚的这项目标，相反可能倒退了。,"And far from furthering Bolivia's cause, the past four years may have set it back."
8581,“当前玻利维亚政府已经阻断了进入太平洋的权限”，Zárate 介绍道。,"""The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,"" said Zárate."
8582,她表示，Morales 的挑衅性的言论耗尽了智利人所剩的善意。,"Morales's belligerent rhetoric has sapped any residual Chilean goodwill, she suggested."
8583,玻利维亚和智利迟早会继续开展对话，但在此之后，要继续开展对话便难上加难。,"Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this."
8584,自 1962 年以来，两国再也没有互换过大使。,The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
8585,玻利维亚驻海牙代表，前总统爱德华多·罗德里格斯·韦尔泽 (Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé) 否定了法院决策异常迅速的这一说法。,"Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually speedy."
8586,周一的结果会为玻利维亚“带来开启与智利关系新时代的绝佳机会”，以及“结束 139 年来分歧的互惠互利”的机会，他介绍道。,"Monday will bring Bolivia ""an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile"" and a chance to ""put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,"" he said."
8587,对于莫拉莱斯（仍然是拉丁美洲最受欢迎的总统之一）是想利用海事问题作为政治拐杖的这种说法，卡尔扎迪拉同样表示否认。,Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
8588,“玻利维亚永远不会放弃对太平洋的使用权利”，他补充道。,"""Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,"" he added."
8589,“裁决将为我们创造机会，让我们战胜过去的历史。”,"""The ruling is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."""
8590,朝鲜表示，若无法信任美国便不会解除核武装,North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless it can trust US
8591,朝鲜外务相李勇浩表示，如果无法信任美国，朝鲜绝不会解除核武装。,North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
8592,在周六举行的联合国大会上，李勇浩发表演讲。,Ri was speaking Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
8593,他呼吁美国履行于新加坡峰会期间，两国领导人之间所作的承诺。,He called on the United States to follow through on promises made during a summit in Singapore between the rivals' leaders.
8594,李勇浩的此番言论事出有因，三个多月之前，美国国务卿迈克·庞培 (Mike Pompeo) 与朝鲜领导人金正恩 (Kim Jong Un) 在新加坡会面，想重启陷入僵局的核外交。,His comments come as US. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of restarting deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
8595,李勇浩说，想通过持续的制裁，甚至反对发表终战宣言，就能逼朝鲜下跪，这简直就是在做“白日梦”。,"Ri says it's a ""pipe dream"" that continued sanctions and U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring the North to its knees."
8596,如果平壤不能首先做出重大的裁军行动，在同意做出宣言这一问题上，华盛顿便会谨慎提防。,Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang first making significant disarmament moves.
8597,金正日和美国总统唐纳德·特朗普都希望能再次举行峰会。,Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
8598,但人们普遍怀疑朝鲜是否真的会放弃其核武库，毕竟，朝鲜极有可能将其视为是保障其安全的唯一途径。,But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal that the country likely sees as the only way to guarantee its safety.
8599,庞培计划下个月访问朝鲜，商量再次进行韩美领导人峰会的事宜。,Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
8600,巴黎时装秀带来众多最新系列头饰,Paris fashion shows reveal latest line in massive headwear on it's way to a High Street near you
8601,如果你在犹豫是不是要再买几顶帽子，或是遮挡阳光，那就不用再犹豫了。,If you want to upsize your hat collection or completely block out the sun then look no further.
8602,华伦天奴 (Valentino) 和托姆·布朗 (Thom Browne) 的设计师们，在巴黎时装周的秀场上，推出了古怪的超大头饰 SS19 系列，惊艳全场。,Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled an array of wacky oversized head gear for their SS19 collection on the runway which dazzled the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
8603,今年夏天，极不实用的帽子席卷了 Instagram，于是，这些设计师们纷纷将自己设计的抢眼的帽子带到了 T 台。,Highly impractical hats have swept Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eye-popping creations down the catwalk.
8604,华伦天奴最引人注目的单品是一顶米色过顶帽子，饰以羽毛状的宽边，将模特们的头完全遮盖住。,The stand out piece by Valentino was an over-the-top beige hat adorned with a feather-like wide brim that swamped the models heads.
8605,其他超大尺寸的饰品还包括饰有珠宝的西瓜帽、巫师帽，甚至还有菠萝帽，不过，这些设计的初衷可不是为了保暖。,"Other over-sized accessories included bejeweled watermelons, a wizard hat and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm."
8606,正值万圣节来临之际，Thom Browne 推出了一系列造型奇异的面具。,Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks- and just in time for Halloween.
8607,许多色彩缤纷的面具，自带双唇，更像是 Hannibal Lecter，而非高级时装。,Many of the colourful masks had sewn up lips and resembled more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
8608,有的酷似水肺潜水装备，还配有呼吸管和护目镜，有的则好似融化的冰淇淋蛋筒。,"One creation resembled scuba diving gear complete with snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone."
8609,继续寻找时尚代言物的旅途中，你还会有更惊奇的发现。,And if you continue the huge fashion statement- you are in luck.
8610,时尚观察员预测，巨大的帽子可能即将登上您身边的时尚大街。,Style watchers predict that the enormous bonnets could be making their way to high streets near you.
8611,Rihanna、Emily Ratajkowski 头顶上的 “La Bomba” 草帽十分惹眼，夸张超大，帽檐宽度足足有 2 英尺，可想而知，随后便会成为炙手可热的流行装饰。,"The out-sized hats come hot on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot wide brim that's been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski."
8612,在社交媒体上溅起的非常不切实际的帽子背后的邪教标签在T台上发送了另一个重要的创作 - 一个几乎和穿泳衣的模特一样大的稻草沙滩包。这顶没什么实用性的帽子在社交媒体上被大肆宣传，其背后的时尚标签让另一大创意登上了 T 台——一种几乎和穿着泳衣的模特一样大的稻草沙滩包。,The cult label behind the highly impractical hat that was splashed across social media sent another big creation down the catwalk - a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit-clad model toting it.
8613,这款焦橙色拉菲草袋，边饰为酒椰色，上面饰有白色皮革手柄，是巴黎时装周 Jacquemus'La Riviera SS19 系列中的点睛之笔。,"The burnt orange raffia bag, trimmed with raffia fringing and topped with a white leather handle, was the stand out piece in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week."

8615,约翰·爱德华 (John Edward)：语言技能对全球公民而言至关重要,John Edward: Languages skills essential for global citizens
8616,苏格兰的私立学校一直保持着优异的学业成绩记录，2018 年亦是如此，也取得了一系列可喜的考试成绩，而个人和集体在体育、艺术、音乐以及其他社区工作等方面取得的成功，更是锦上添花。,"Scotland's independent schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, which is only strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavours."
8617,"这些私立学校中聚集着苏格兰全国 30,000 多名学生，在苏格兰私立学校委员会 (SCIS) 的带领下，努力为学生和家长们提供最优质的服务。","With upwards of 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their pupils and parents."
8618,私立学校的宗旨是为学生们的继续教育和高等教育、职业选择以及作为全球公民的社会地位打下良好基础。,"Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens."
8619,作为能够设计和实施定制化学校课程的教育机构，我们有幸得以见证现代语言在学校里始终是一门备受欢迎的学科。,"As an education sector that can design and implement a bespoke school curriculum, we are seeing modern languages continue as a popular and desired subject of choice within schools."
8620,纳尔逊·曼德拉 (Nelson Mandela) 曾说过：“如果你用别人能理解的语言与对方谈话，你的话会进入对方的脑中。,"Nelson Mandela said: ""If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head."
8621,如果你用对方的母语与之谈话，你的话会进入对方的心里。”,"If you talk to him in his own language that goes to his heart."""
8622,这句话提醒了我们，当我们想要与外国友人建立关系和信任时，我们不能只依靠英语。,This is a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English when wanting to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
8623,从今年最新的考试结果来看，私立学校的语言通过率稳居榜首。,"From this year's recent exam results, we can see that languages are topping the league tables with the highest pass rates within independent schools."
8624,学习外语的学生中有 68% 取得了 A 级成绩。,A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages achieved a Higher grade A.
8625,来自苏格兰私立学校委员会 (SCIS) 74 所成员学校的数据显示，72% 的学生中文取得了 A 级成绩，而其中 72% 学习德语的学生，69% 学习法语的学生以及 63% 学习西班牙语的学生也都取得了 A 级成绩。,"The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a Higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent studying Spanish also achieved an A."
8626,这表明，苏格兰的私立学校正在支持着外语成为一项儿童和青少年未来无疑会需要的重要技能。,This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly require in the future.
8627,如今，作为一项科目，在私立学校课程表和其他地方，语言与 STEM 科目（科学、技术、工程和数学）被一视同仁。,"Languages now, as a subject choice, are being held in the same regard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curriculums and elsewhere."
8628,英国就业与技能委员会 (UK Commission for Employment and Skills) 2014 年的一项调查显示，在雇员们为填补职位空缺而付出努力的原因中，17% 是因为语言技能的短缺。,"A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that of reasons employers gave for struggling to fill vacancies, 17 per cent were attributed to a languages skills shortage."
8629,因此，为了给青少年日后的职业生涯打下良好基础，语言技能变得越来越不可或缺。,"Therefore more and more, language skills are becoming imperative in order to prepare young people for their future careers."
8630,随着未来将有更多的就业机会需要语言，这项技能在如今全球化的世界范围内变得至关重要。,"With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world."
8631,无论你选择的职业是什么，如果学习了第二语言，掌握了这项受益终身的技能，未来一定会拥有真正的优势。,"Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they've learned a second language, they'll have a real advantage in the future having a life-long skill such as this."
8632,能够与外国友人直接交流，定会令掌握多种语言的人在竞争中高人一等。,Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
8633,"YouGov 2013 年一项涉及 4,000 多名英国成年公民的调查显示，75% 的人能够很好地运用外语进行对话，法语是唯一一门使用人数百分比达到两位数 （15%）的语言。","According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 per cent."
8634,因此，加大对当今儿童语言教育的投资十分必要。,This is why putting the investment into language teaching now is important for today's children.
8635,掌握多种语言，特别是发展中国家的语言，将为孩子们提供更好的机会，以便找到有意义的工作。,"Having multiple languages, particularly those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful employment."
8636,在苏格兰，每所学校教授的语言各不相同。,"Within Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach."
8637,很多学校重点教授更为经典的现代语言，而其他学校则教授他们认为在 2020 年将对英国十分重要的语言，如中文或日语。,"A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, whereas others will teach languages that are deemed to be most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese."
8638,无论你的孩子对哪种语言感兴趣，私立学校都会提供多种语言选择，并且配备该领域的专业教职人员。,"Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this area."
8639,无论孩子的未来如何，苏格兰的私立学校都致力于提供一个良好的学习环境，这里可以为孩子们打下坚实基础并为他们提供取得成功所必备的技能。,"Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and arm them with the skills required to succeed, whatever the future holds."
8640,无可否认，如今在全球化商业环境中，语言对国家的未来仍然至关重要，因此必须反映在教育中。,"It can't be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vitally important to the country's future, so this must be mirrored in education."
8641,的确，现代语言应该真正被视为“国际沟通技能”。,"Indeed, modern languages should really be considered ""international communication skills."""
8642,苏格兰的私立学校将继续为青少年提供这样的选择、多样性和卓越优势。,"Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland's young people."
8643,必须这样做。,Il faut bien le faire.

8645,勒布朗将于周日在圣地亚哥迎来湖人队的首秀,LeBron to make Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
8646,球迷们即将等来勒布朗·詹姆斯 (LeBron James) 在洛杉矶湖人队的首秀。,The wait is nearly over for fans looking to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
8647,湖人队主教练卢克·沃顿 (Luke Walton) 宣布詹姆斯将参加周日在圣地亚哥对阵丹佛掘金队的季前赛首场比赛。,Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
8648,但是，目前还不确定詹姆斯的上场时间。,But just how many minutes he'll play has yet to be determined.
8649,沃顿在湖人队的“官方网站”上表示，“时长将在 1 分钟到 48 分钟之间”。,"""It will be more than one and less than 48,"" said Walton on the Lakers"" official website."
8650,湖人队记者麦克·特鲁德尔 (Mike Trudel) 在推特上写到，詹姆斯的上场时间可能有限。,Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play limited minutes.
8651,本周早些时候训练结束之后，詹姆斯被问及对湖人队六场季前赛时间表的规划。,"Following practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers"" six-game preseason schedule."
8652,“在职业生涯的这个阶段，我已经不再需要季前赛来热身”，他说到。,"""I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to get ready,"" he said."
8653,特朗普的西佛吉尼亚州集会时间，YouTube 频道,"Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube Channel"
8654,唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump) 总统今晚将在西弗吉尼亚州的惠灵开始一系列的竞选集会。,"President Donald Trump begins a flurry of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia."
8655,这是特朗普计划于下周举行的五场集会中的第一场，包括在一些对其友好的地方停留，如田纳西州和西西比州。,"It's Trump's first of five scheduled rallies in the next week, including stops in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi."
8656,由于选择填补最高法院的空缺职位导致投票表决暂停，特朗普此举旨在为即将到来的中期选举争取支持，因为在 11 月举行投票期间，共和党面临着失去国会控制权的危险。,"With the confirmation vote on hold for his pick to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is aiming to build support for upcoming mid-term elections since Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast on Nov."
8657,今晚特朗普西佛吉尼亚州集会的时间以及如何在线观看？,What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how do you watch online?
8658,特朗普于西弗吉尼亚州惠灵的集会计划于 2018 年 9 月 29 日，即东部时间今晚 7 点举行。,"Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018."
8659,您可以通过 YouTube 的直播频道在线观看特朗普的西佛吉尼亚州集会。,You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
8660,特朗普很可能会就最高法院候选人布雷特·卡瓦诺 (Brett Kavanaugh) 的问题在本周的听证会上发表讲话，在联邦调查局 (FBI) 进行调查期间，由于预期的参议院投票表决暂停长达一周的时间，导致对性行为不端的指控形势变得紧张。,"Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which became tense over sexual misconduct allegations with an anticipated Senate confirmation vote on hold for up to a week while the FBI investigates."
8661,但是，这一些列集会的主要目的是帮助即将面临 11 月大选的共和党争取一些支持。,But the primary aim of this flurry of rallies is helping Republicans facing touch November elections gain some momentum.
8662,据路透社报道，特朗普总统的竞选团称，下周举行的五场集会旨在“激励志愿者和支持者们，因为共和党试图保护并扩大他们在参议院和众议院所占的席位”。,"Thus, President Trump's campaign said these five rallies in the next week are aimed at ""energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,"" according to Reuters."
8663,特朗普竞选团中一位拒绝透露姓名的发言人告诉路透社，“国会的控制权对其议程而言至关重要，因此随着忙碌的竞选季到来，总统将前往尽可能多的州”。,"""Control of Congress is so critical for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we head into the busy campaign season,"" a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters."
8664,据西佛吉尼亚州《都市报》报道，“计划于今晚在惠灵伟思班科竞技场 (Wesbanco Arena) 举行的集会，将汇集众多来自俄亥俄州和宾夕法尼亚州的支持者们，并且将吸引大量匹兹堡媒体前来报道”。,"Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring supporters from ""Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from the Pittsburgh media,"" according to the West Virginia Metro News."
8665,周六特朗普将在过去一个月内第二次对西佛吉尼亚州进行访问，2016 年特朗普在该州以超过 40% 的优势获胜。,"Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016."
8666,特朗普试图帮助在民意调查中落后的西佛吉尼亚州共和党参议院候选人派崔克·莫里西 (Patrick Morrisey)。,"Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing in the polls."
8667,据路透社报道，西弗吉尼亚大学的政治学者西蒙·哈德 (Simon Haeder) 表示，“总统不得不在民意调查中为其推波助澜，这对莫里西而言并不是一个好兆头”。,"""It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him a boost in the polls,"" said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters."
8668,2018 年莱德杯：美国队在周日的单打比赛中展现了顽强拼搏的竞技精神,Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show stomach for fight to keep hopes alive heading into Sunday singles
8669,经过前三场的单打比赛后，周六下午的四人一球赛可能正是莱德杯所需要的。,"After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes might just have been what this Ryder Cup needed."
8670,动量摆是体育界发明的一种全新的概念，体育选手对其坚信不疑，在这样的比赛中更是如此。,"The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sporting concept but one that players truly believe in, and never more so than at competitions like these."
8671,现在，动量处于什么位置呢？,So where would they say the momentum is now?
8672,“他们之前领先 6 分，现在领先 4 分，所以我想我们现在拥有一些动量吧，”乔丹·斯皮思 (Jordan Spieth) 说道。,"""They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we are carrying that as a little bit of momentum I guess,"" said Jordan Spieth as he strolled off for the day."
8673,当然，欧洲队有一定的优势，目前领先 4 分，接下来的比赛中还有 12 分。,"Europe have the advantage, of course, four points ahead with twelve more in play."
8674,正如斯皮思所言，美国队觉得有些不太顺利，但是很多方面都值得鼓励，尤其是斯皮思和贾斯汀·托马斯 (Justin Thomas) 的表现，他们打了一整天的比赛，分别取得了 4 分中的 3 分。,"The Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have a little wind in their sails though and they have plenty to be encouraged by, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boast three points from four."
8675,斯皮思从发球台到果岭都极具杀伤力，打出了标杆式的水准。,Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is leading by example.
8676,随着比赛的进行，呐喊欢呼声此起彼伏，在他和托马斯 2 比 2 落后的情况下，他一记关键的推杆将第四场比赛打成平手。,"Those guttural screams of celebration got louder as his round went on, sinking a crucial putt to take match four all-square when he and Thomas had been two down after two."
8677,他的推杆为美国队赢得了胜利，场上再次响起欢呼呐喊声，这让我们看到，他们相信美国队并没有出局。,"His putt that won them the match on 15 was met with a similar scream, the sort that tells you he believes that the American team is not out of this."
8678,斯皮思说道：“你真的需要深入自己的内心，心系比赛。”,"""You've really just got to dig deep and worry about your own match,"" Spieth said."
8679,这是所有球员目前所处的状态。,It is all each of these players has left now.
8680,18 个要打出球标的洞。,18 holes to make a mark.
8681,过去两天里，得分超过斯皮思和托马斯的球员，只有弗朗切斯科·莫利纳里 (Francesco Molinari) 和汤米·弗利特伍德 (Tommy Fleetwood)，这是莱德杯无可争议的赛况。,"The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup."
8682,欧洲队的这对奇怪却不失可爱的组合，四场胜利没有失球，他们不会犯错。,Europe's odd but adorable couple are four from four and can do no wrong.
8683,“莫里伍德”(Moliwood) 是唯一一组在周六下午没有打出柏忌的搭档，但他们也在周六上午、周五下午和周五上午的后九局避开了柏忌。,"""Moliwood"" were the only pair not to shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning."
8684,这种能量流向这伙喧闹的人群以及从中流出的方式，更加说明了他们才是在周日要击败的对象，而且不会有更受欢迎的球员能稳操欧洲胜利。,"That run, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this boisterous crowd cements that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to seal a potential European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari."
8685,最好同时在不同的洞里。,Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
8686,不过，现在谈论欧洲队取胜，还为时过早。,"Talk of European glory remains premature, though."
8687,布巴·沃森 (Bubba Watson) 和韦伯·辛普森 (Webb Simpson) 很快就搞定了与亚历克斯·诺伦 (Alex Noren) 搭档的上午的四球英雄塞尔吉奥·加西亚 (Sergio Garcia)。,"Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short work of Sergio Garcia, the morning's fourballs hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren."
8688,"一个柏忌和两个前九 ""doubles"" 把这位西班牙人选手和这个瑞典选手打进了一个永远也爬不出来的洞里。",A bogey and two doubles on the front nine dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they never got close to climbing out of.
8689,但是在周日，没有人能帮你走出“洞”。,"On Sunday, though, there is nobody to help you out of your hole."
8690,这场四人四球赛和四人一球赛格外具有吸引力，适合近距离观看，因为搭档之间的配合，相互提出的建议，相互提出的提醒以及策略，都可能瞬间改变。,"The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between pairings, the advice they give, the advice they don't and the way that a strategy can change in an instant."
8691,到目前为止，欧洲球队表现更佳，并在最后一天取得了明显的领先优势，但这场四人一球赛也表明，人们，尤其是美国国内的人们，所怀疑的并不属实，美国队渴望战斗。,"Europe have played better as a team thus far and take a significant lead into the final day but this foursomes session also showed that Team USA has the stomach for the fight that some, especially Stateside, had been doubting."
8692,欧洲队以 10-6 领先进入莱德杯决赛,Europe take 10-6 lead into Ryder Cup final day
8693,在周六的四人四球赛和四人两球赛中以 10-6 战胜美国队出线后，欧洲队将以绝对优势进入莱德杯决赛。,Europe will take a healthy advantage into the final day of the Ryder Cup after emerging from Saturday's fourballs and foursomes matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
8694,直觉敏锐的二人组汤米·弗利特伍德 (Tommy Fleetwood ) 和弗兰西斯科·莫里纳利 (Francesco Molinari) 在对抗老虎·伍兹 (Tiger Woods) 的比赛中拔得头筹，取得了两场胜利，将目前为止在法国国家高尔夫球场 (Le Golf National) 获得的积分增至四分。,Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their tally so far at Le Golf National to four points.
8695,托马斯·比约恩 (Thomas Bjorn) 的欧洲队试图挽回这枚两年前在黑泽汀失去的奖杯，在早上的四人四球赛中击败了出现失误的美国队，获得 3-1 连胜。,"Thomas Bjorn's European side, bidding to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a misfiring American side in the morning fourballs, taking the series 3-1."
8696,美国队在四人两球赛中大举抵抗，赢得了两场比赛，但始终无法弥补落后境遇。,"The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but they could not eat into the deficit."
8697,吉姆·福瑞克 (Jim Furyk) 的球队需要在周日的 12 场单打比赛中得到八分才能卫冕奖杯。,Jim Furyk's side need eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
8698,弗利特伍德是第一位连得四分的欧洲新秀，而他和莫里纳利在这个轰动一时的周末过后被称为“莫里伍德”组合，他们是莱德杯历史上第二对在开场四场比赛中赢得四分的选手。,"Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, dubbed ""Molliwood"" after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to win four points from their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history."
8699,在四人四球赛中击败伍兹和帕特里克·瑞德 (Patrick Reed) 后，他们配合极为默契，最终以 5-4 的大胜击败了灰心丧气的伍兹和美国新秀布赖森·德尚博 (Bryson Dechambeau)。,Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs they then gelled superbly to beat a deflated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even more emphatic 5&amp;4.
8700,勉强完成周六两场比赛的伍兹，虽偶尔也曾爆发光芒，但是目前他在已经在 29 场四人四球赛和四人两球赛中输掉了 19 场，其中连负 7 场。,"Woods, who dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, showed occasional bursts of brilliance but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row."
8701,早上未参加四人四球赛的贾斯汀·罗斯 (Justin Rose)，在四人两球赛中回到了搭档亨利克·斯滕森 (Henrik Stenson) 身边，二人以 2-1 击败了达斯汀·约翰逊 (Dustin Johnson) 和布洛克斯·科普卡 (Brooks Koepka) - 二者分别排名世界第一和世界第三。,"Justin Rose, rested for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to a 2&amp;1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world."
8702,尽管可以在巴黎西南部度过轻松、愉快的一天，但欧洲队并没有为所欲为。,"Europe did not have it al their own way though on a pleasant, breezy day south west of Paris."
8703,三次大满贯得主乔丹·斯皮思 (Jordan Spieth) 和贾斯汀·托马斯 (Justin Thomas) 周六以两分为美国队打下了良好的基础。,Three-times major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
8704,他们在四人四球赛中以 2-1 艰难拿下西班牙的琼·拉姆 (Jon Rahm) 和伊恩·保尔特 (Ian Poulter)，回来之后又在四人两球赛中以 4-3 击败了波尔特和罗里·麦克罗伊 (Rory McIlroy)，尽管丢掉了开场的两洞。,They earned a gritty 2&amp;1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&amp;3 in the foursomes having lost the opening two holes.
8705,在莱德杯历史上只有两次落后四分的球队能够进入单打比赛，尽管作为东道主的福瑞克队只需抽签即可卫冕奖杯。,"Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit going into the singles, although as holders Furyk's side need only draw to retain the trophy."
8706,然而，由于在前两天的比赛中排名第二，似乎将在周日的反击中被反超。,"After being second-best for two days, however, a Sunday counter-attack looks as though it will be beyond them."
8707,朝鲜方面表示，没有足够的信任“决不可能”单方面解除武装,North Korea says 'no way' will disarm unilaterally without trust
8708,朝鲜外交部长周六向联合国表示，持续的制裁加深了朝鲜对美国的不信任，在这种情况下，朝鲜决不可能单方面放弃核武器。,North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday continued sanctions were deepening its mistrust in the United States and there was no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
8709,李勇浩 (Ri Yong Ho) 在世界组织的年度联合国大会上发言称，朝鲜在过去一年里已经采取了“大量友善的举措”，例如停止核试验和导弹试验、拆除核试验场，以及保证不会激增核武器和核技术。,"Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken ""significant goodwill measures"" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missiles tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology."
8710,“然而，我们并没有看到美国方面做出任何回应”，李说。,"""However, we do not see any corresponding response from the U.S.,"" he said."
8711,“只要仍对美国缺乏信任，我方对国家安全就没有把握，在这种情况下，我方无论如何不会成为单方面解除武装的‘出头鸟'。”,"""Without any trust in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first."""
8712,虽然李重申了朝鲜对华盛顿抵制“分阶段”无核化（在此情况下，朝鲜将因采取逐步渐进的措施而获得奖励）手段的一贯抱怨，但是其声明的重点似乎在于朝鲜并未像过去平壤一样拒绝放弃单方面无核化。,"While Ri reprised familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a ""phased"" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement appeared significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization out of hand as Pyongyang has done in the past."
8713,李提到了现任美国总统唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump) 和朝鲜领导人金正恩于 6 月 12 日在新加坡首次会晤时发表的联合声明，期间金正恩承诺将致力于实现“朝鲜半岛无核化”，而特朗普则承诺保证朝鲜的安全。,"Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first ever summit between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward ""denuclearization of the Korean peninsula"" while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea's security."
8714,朝鲜一直在寻求正式终结 1950 年至 1953 年的朝鲜战争，但美国表示，平壤方面必须先放弃核武器。,"North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korea War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first."
8715,华盛顿方面也对放松对朝鲜进行严厉国际制裁的呼吁进行了抵制。,Washington has also resisted calls to relax tough international sanctions on North Korea.
8716,李表示，“美国坚持‘无核化先行’，并通过制裁施压，以强制性手段达到目的，甚至反对‘宣布战争结束’”。,"""The U.S. insists on the ""denuclearization-first"" and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner, and even objecting to the ""declaration of the end of war,"""" Ri said."
8717,“认为制裁能使我们屈服只不过是那些对我们一无所知的人们的一场白日梦。,"""The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is a pipe dream of the people who are ignorant about us."
8718,但问题是，持续的制裁正在加深我们对美国的不信任。”,"But the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust."""
8719,李没有提及本周早些时候美国领导人在联合国强调的金正恩和特朗普之间举行第二次峰会的计划。,Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier in the week.
8720,外交部长坚持强调，过去五个月内，金正恩与韩国领导人文在寅 (Moon Jae-in) 进行了三次会晤，他补充道：“如果无核化问题的一方是韩国而不是美国，那么朝鲜半岛的无核化问题将不会陷入如此僵局”。,"The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: ""If the party to this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the U.S., the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a deadlock."""
8721,即便如此，在“邪恶总统”特朗普称金正恩是一名执行自杀任务的“火箭客”后，李告知联合国大会，朝鲜的炮火将不可避免地对准美国本土，但是，李的发言口风与去年截然不同。,"Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korea's rockets was inevitable after ""Mr Evil President"" Trump called Kim a ""rocket man"" on a suicide mission."
8722,去年曾威胁称要“彻底摧毁”朝鲜的特朗普，今年在联合国对金正恩采取解除武装措施的勇气大加赞赏，但他表示，还有很多工作要做，在朝鲜实现无核化之前必须继续实施制裁。,"This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to ""totally destroy"" North Korea, heaped praise on Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work still had to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes."
8723,周三，特朗普表示没有对此制定时间范围，他说“即使这需要两年、三年或五个月，都没关系”。,"On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for this, saying ""If it takes two years, three years or five months - doesn't matter."""
8724,中国和俄罗斯认为联合国安理会应该对平壤所采取的措施予以奖励。,China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for steps taken.
8725,然而，美国国务卿迈克·蓬佩奥 (Mike Pompeo) 周三向联合国安理会表示：“务必持续大力执行安理会的制裁，直至我们实现最终且完全可验证的无核化”。,"However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: ""Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we realize the fully, final, verified denuclearization."""
8726,自 2006 年以来，安理会一致同意加强对朝鲜的制裁，以切断平壤核项目和弹道导弹项目的资金来源。,The Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
8727,蓬佩奥与李勇浩在联合国大会的场边相遇，表示他将于下个月再次访问平壤，为第二次峰会做准备。,Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
8728,今年，蓬佩奥已经三次访问朝鲜，但是他的最后一次行程并不顺利。,"Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well."
8729,他于七月份离开平壤时表示，如果朝鲜没有在数小时内谴责他提出“匪徒一样的要求”，那么此行便取得了一定的进展。,"He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea within hours to denounce him for making ""gangster-like demands."""
8730,在本月与文在寅的一次会晤中，朝鲜方面承诺，如果美国采取“相应措施”，那么我方将拆除导弹发射场以及核复合体。,"North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took ""corresponding measures."""
8731,李表示金正恩告诉他，他正在寻求的“相应措施”就是特朗普在新加坡所承诺的安全保证，以及与华盛顿方面关系正常化的进展。,"He said Kim had told him the ""corresponding measures"" he was seeking were security guarantees Trump pledged in Singapore and moves toward normalization of relations with Washington."
8732,哈佛大学学生参加课程学习如何获得足够的休息时间,Harvard students take course in getting enough rest
8733,今年，哈佛大学开设了一门新课程，让所有本科生都获得了更多的睡眠，以此抵抗日益严重的服用咖啡因熬夜的男子文化。,A new course at Harvard University this year has got all its undergraduates getting more sleep in a bid to combat the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-fuelled 'all-nighters.'
8734,一位学者发现，世界排名第一的大学，在谈及如何照顾自己的基本问题时，学生往往毫无头绪。,An academic found students at the world's number one university are often clueless when it comes to the very basics about how to look after themselves.
8735,这门课程的设计者是哈佛医学院睡眠医学教授，布里格姆妇女医院 (Brigham and Women's Hospital) 专家 Charles Czeisler，他认为这是美国第一门此类课程。,"Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US."
8736,在发表了一篇关于睡眠不足对学习影响的演讲之后，他受到启发，开始研究这门课程。,He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
8737,“在演讲结束后，一名女生走到我近前，问我：‘为什么我都到了大四了，才了解到这个？’,"'At the end of it one girl came up to me and said: 'Why am I only being told this now, in my senior year?'"
8738,她说，没有人告诉过她睡眠有多么重要，这让我大吃一惊“，他向《The Telegraph》这样介绍道。,"She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me,' he told The Telegraph."
8739,该课程于今年首次推出，课程主要向学生解释良好的睡眠习惯如何有助于学业和运动表现，以及改善他们的整体健康。,"The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their general wellbeing."
8740,哈佛医学院精神病学教授兼大学健康服务部 (Health Services) 执行主任 Paul Barreira 介绍称，在发现学生严重睡眠不足后，哈佛大学决定在本周推出该课程。,"Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding students were seriously sleep deprived during the week."
8741,长达一小时的课程涉及一系列互动任务。,The hour long course involves a series of interactive tasks.
8742,有一节课程中，展示了一张宿舍图片，学生们敲着咖啡杯、窗帘，培训课本和书籍，在听着咖啡因和光的影响，睡眠不足对运动表现的影响，以及睡前活动的重要性。,"In one section there is an image of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is impacted by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a bedtime routine."
8743,在另一节课程中，学生了解到了长期睡眠不足如何增加心脏病发作、中风、抑郁症和癌症的风险。,"In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer."
8744,课堂上，挂了一幅校园地图，上面画着互动图标，鼓励学生思考自己的日常活动。,"A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine."
8745,“我们知道，这并不会马上改变学生的行为。,'We know it won't change students' behaviour instantly.
8746,但我们相信他们有权知道，就像你有权知道吸烟对健康有害一样'，Czeisler 教授补充道。,"But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,' Prof Czeisler added."
8747,他说，现在还存在以“全力以赴”为自豪的现象，并补充说现代技术和学生压力的与日俱增，都意味着睡眠不足将成为一个日益严重的问题。,"The culture of pride in 'pulling an all-nighter' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation was a growing problem."
8748,他说，确保有足够的睡眠和良好的睡眠质量，应该成为学生应对压力、疲惫和焦虑的“秘密武器”，甚至是为了避免增加体重，因为睡眠不足会使大脑进入饥饿模式，使人总感觉有饥饿感。,"Ensuring you have enough sleep, of a good quality, should be a student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid putting on weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, making them constantly hungry."
8749,19 岁的加利福尼亚人 Raymond So，专业是化学和物理生物学，去年是他在哈佛大学的第一年，当时参加了 Czeisler 教授的一门课，于是帮助教授设计了这门课程。,"Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard."
8750,他说，这门课程让他大开眼界，激励他为了打造一门校园课程而全力以赴。,He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course.
8751,接下来，他的希望是，让所有研究生在加入竞争机构之前，完成类似的学习课程。,"The next step, he hopes, it to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution."
8752,Czeisler 教授建议学生应该考虑设置上床睡觉以及起床的闹钟，注意电子屏幕和 LED 照明设备发出的“蓝光”的有害影响，因为这可能会导致人的昼夜节律失控，从而导致入睡困难。,"Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, as well as for when to wake, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can throw your circadian rhythm out of kilter, leading to problems falling asleep."
8753,利文斯顿 1-0 战胜流浪者：蒙加的进球迫使杰拉德队落后,Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goal downs Gerrard's men
8754,由于多利·蒙加 (Dolly Menga) 的进球使得史蒂文·杰拉德 (Steven Gerrard) 支离破碎的球队以 1-0 不敌利文斯顿，流浪者再遭失利。,Rangers suffered another bout of away-day blues as Dolly Menga's strike consigned Steven Gerrard's disjointed side to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
8755,埃布罗克斯本欲记录自二月份以 4-1 战胜圣约翰斯通以来取得的首场客场胜利，但是加里·霍尔特 (Gary Holt) 的球队却遭遇了杰拉德执教 18 场比赛以来的第二次失利，致使他的球队在与立博超级联赛领先者哈茨队的比赛中落后 8 分。,"The Ibrox side were looking to record their first win on the road since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted just Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his side eight points adrift of runaway Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts."
8756,蒙加在上半场结束前 7 分钟射门得分，流浪者队阵容缺乏气势，似乎难以势均破敌。,Menga struck seven minutes before half-time and a Rangers line-up short on inspiration never looked like levelling.
8757,如今流浪者下降至第六位，而利文斯顿上升至第三位，净胜球数量仅仅落后于希伯尼安。,"While Rangers now drop down to sixth spot, Livingston climb to third and only behind Hibernian on goal difference."
8758,客场比赛结束时扔出的物体致使边线裁判考勒姆·斯宾塞 (Calum Spence) 头部受伤，这可能会给流浪者带来后续麻烦。,And there could be further trouble in store for Rangers after linesman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown from the away end.
8759,杰拉德八次换人，横扫艾尔联进入苏格兰联赛杯 (Betfred Cup) 半决赛。,Gerrard made eight changes to the side which swept past Ayr into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
8760,另一方面，霍尔特同样选择了上周拿下哈茨队一分的 11 名利文斯顿球员，如果这些训练有素的球队们能在每个回合都压制住对手，那么他将感到很满意。,"Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 which took a point off Hearts last week and he would have been delighted with the way his well-drilled outfit suffocated their opponents at every turn."
8761,流浪者队可能已经占据了主动，但利文斯顿在控球方面表现异常突出。,Rangers may have dominated possession but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
8762,他们本应该在两分钟内进球，蒙加第一次将球传给斯科特·皮特曼 (Scott Pittman) 越过阿兰·麦格雷戈 (Allan McGregor) 完成进球，但这名中场球员却错失了大好机会。,They should have scored just two minutes in when Menga's first-time lay-off sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder tugged his big chance wide.
8763,随后，雅各布斯 (Keaghan Jacobs) 的一记深度任意球将球传给队长克雷格·哈尔科特 (Craig Halkett)，但他的防守搭档艾伦·利思戈 (Alan Lithgow) 却打偏在了后立柱上。,A deep Keaghan Jacobs free-kick then found skipper Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only stab wide at the back post.
8764,流浪者队确实控制住了局面，但对于三分之一决赛，他们对自己的希望似乎大于信念。,Rangers did grab control but there looked to be more hope than belief about their play in the final third.
8765,比赛进行到一刻钟时，阿尔弗雷多·莫雷洛斯 (Alfredo Morelos) 与史蒂文·劳莱斯 (Steven Lawless ) 发生冲撞，莫雷洛斯满心认为自己会获得点球，但裁判史蒂文·汤姆森 (Steven Thomson) 拒绝了这位哥伦比亚球员的诉求。,Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have had a penalty on the quarter-hour mark as he and Steven Lawless collided but referee Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's appeals.
8766,流浪者队上半场只进了两个球，但前埃布罗克斯队门将利亚姆·凯利 (Liam Kelly) 几乎没有被拉萨纳·库利巴利 (Lassana Coulibaly) 的头球和奥维·埃贾里亚 (Ovie Ejaria) 中规中矩的射门所困扰。,Rangers managed just two first-half shots on target but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely troubled by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame Ovie Ejaria strike.
8767,虽然利文斯顿第 34 分钟的揭幕战对比赛节奏可能不利，但无人否认他们的艰难配得上这一结果。,"While Livi's 34th-minute opener may have been against the run of play, no one can deny they deserved it for their graft alone."
8768,流浪者再次深陷雅各布斯精心设定的攻防套路。,Again Rangers failed to deal with a deep Jacobs set-piece.
8769,当德克兰·加拉格尔 (Declan Gallagher) 把球传给斯科特·罗宾逊 (Scott Robinson) 时，斯科特·阿菲尔德 (Scott Arfield) 并没有做出任何反应，阿菲尔德冷静地判断出蒙加将完成一记简单的射门。,"Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher slotted the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to pick out Menga for a simple finish."
8770,杰拉德在中场休息时用库利巴利换下了瑞安·肯特 (Ryan Kent)，这一换人几乎立刻就产生效果，边锋莫雷洛斯的位置产生空缺，但令人印象深刻的凯利从自己的防线上冲上前阻拦。,Gerrard acted at the break as he swapped Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the switch almost provided an immediate impact as the winger slotted in Morelos but the impressive Kelly raced from his line to block.
8771,然而利文斯顿继续以他们享受的方式吸引着球迷们的眼球，利思戈和哈尔科特相继上演着一个又一个长传球。,"But Livingston continued to suck the visitors into playing exactly the type of game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping up long ball after long ball."
8772,霍尔特的球队本来可以在最后阶段拉大领先优势，但在利思戈从角落里头球破门之前，麦格雷戈很好地顶住了雅各布斯的进攻。,Holt's side could have stretched their lead in the final stages but McGregor stood up well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow headed wide from the corner.
8773,流浪者队替补队员格伦·米德尔顿 (Glenn Middleton) 在与雅各布斯发生争执后，再次申请点球，但汤姆森又一次视而不见。,Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty as he tangled with Jacobs but again Thomson looked away.
8774,年鉴：盖革计数器的发明者,Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
8775,"接下来，是《周日早报》年鉴中的内容：1882 年 9 月 30 日，也就是 136 年前的今天，算起来…… 正是之后的物理学家约翰尼斯·威廉“汉斯”·盖革 (Johannes Wilhelm ""Hans"" Geiger) 于德国出生的日子。","And now a page from our ""Sunday Morning"" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and COUNTING ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm ""Hans"" Geiger was born in Germany."
8776,盖革研发了一种检测和测量放射性的方法，而这最终发展成了名为“盖革计数器”的装置。,"Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Counter."
8777,从此，盖革计数器成为了大众文化的中流砥柱，就像 1950 年的电影《科罗拉多之钟》中，扮演看似不太可能成为科学家的的牛仔 Roy Rogers 和 Dale Evans 的台词一样：,"A mainstay of science ever since, the Geiger Counter became a pop culture mainstay as well, as in the 1950 movie ""Bells of Coronado,"" starring those seemingly unlikely cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:"
8778,男子：“这到底是什么玩意？”,"Man: ""What in the world is that?"""
8779,Rogers：“这是盖革计数器，用来定位铀之类的放射性矿物。,"Rogers: ""It's a Geiger Counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium."
8780,戴上耳机后，甚至能听到矿物中放射作用所释放的原子产生的影响。”,"When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms given off by the radioactivity in the minerals."""
8781,Evans：“不得不缩，肯定会特别流行！”,"Evans: ""Say, it sure is popping now!"""
8782,"""'汉斯'·盖革于 1945 即将迎来他 63 岁生日之际逝世。","""Hans"" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days short of his 63rd birthday."
8783,可是，以他的名字命名的这项发明将永存不朽。,But the invention that bears his name lives on.
8784,新型癌症疫苗可以训练免疫系统“发现”无赖细胞,New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' rogue cells
8785,新型癌症疫苗可以训练免疫系统“发现”无赖细胞并将其杀死,New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' rogue cells and kill them
8786,疫苗训练免疫系统识别无赖细胞，从而用于治疗,Vaccine teaches immune system to recognise rogue cells as part of treatment
8787,这种方法需要从患者体内提取免疫细胞，然后在实验室对其进行更改,"Method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in lab"
8788,这样，便可以“发现”多种癌症所常见的一种蛋白质，然后重新注入体内,They can then 'see' a protein common to many cancers and then reinjected
8789,一种试验疫苗在多种癌症患者中卓见成效。,A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
8790,将这种训练免疫系统识别无赖细胞的疫苗用于一名女性的治疗后，她的卵巢癌已经消失了 18 个月。,"One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise rogue cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months."
8791,这种方法需要从患者体内提取免疫细胞，然后在实验室对其进行更改，使其能够“发现”多种癌症所常见的一种叫作 HER2 的蛋白质，然后将其重新注入体内。,"The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so they can ""see"" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells."
8792,马里兰州贝塞斯达市美国国家癌症研究中心 (US National Cancer Institute) 的 Jay Berzofsky 教授说道：“我们的试验结果表明，我们即将迎来一种非常有前景的疫苗。”,"Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: ""Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."""
8793,Berzofsky 教授解释称，HER2 “是促进几种癌症发展的因素，包括乳腺癌、卵巢癌、肺癌和结肠癌。”,"HER2 ""drives the growth of several types of cancer,"" including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Prof Berzofsky explained."
8794,将免疫细胞从患者体内提取出来，然后“训练”它们定位癌细胞，采用类似的方法，在一种白血病的治疗中已初见成效。,"A similar approach of taking immune cells out of patients and ""teaching"" them how to target cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukaemia."
8795,此前曾戴着 MAGA 帽子参加 SNL 的坎耶·维斯特 (Kanye West) 面临着因支持特朗普而引发的谩骂。,"Kanye West Embarked on a Pro-Trump Diatribe, Wearing a MAGA Hat, After his SNL Appearance."
8796,结果并不怎么好,It Didn't Go Well
8797,在《周六夜现场》 (Saturday Night Live) 演播室里，一段公开称赞美国总统唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump) 并表示其应该参与 2020 年大选的杂乱无章的演讲中，坎耶·维斯特 (Kanye West) 遭遇了一片嘘声。,Kanye West was booed in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after a rambling performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
8798,戴着“让美国伟大 (Make America Great)”的帽子表演完当晚的第三首歌《Ghost Town》后，他开始声讨共和党，并重申对特朗普的支持。,"After performing his third song of the night, called Ghost Town in which he was wearing a Make America Great cap, he went on a rant against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump."
8799,“很多次我与白人对话，他们都说：“你怎么会喜欢特朗普，他种族歧视？”,"""So many times I talk to a white person and they say: ""How could you like Trump, he's racist?"""
8800,“那么，如果我担心种族歧视，很久以前就不会从美国搬出来了”，维斯特说到。,"Well, if I was concerned about racism I would've moved out of America a long time ago,"" he said."
8801,SNL 以马特·达蒙 (Matt Damon) 主演的滑稽短剧开场，在该剧中好莱坞明星嘲讽了布雷特·卡瓦诺 (Brett Kavanaugh) 在参议院司法委员会面前就克里斯汀·布莱西·福特 (Christine Blasey Ford) 提出的性侵指控所提供的证词。,SNL started the show with a skit starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
8802,尽管该节目未经播出，但维斯特咆哮的镜头被喜剧演员基斯·洛克 (Chris Rock) 上传到了社交媒体上。,"Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West's rant was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock."
8803,目前很难确定洛克发布该视频是否是为了嘲弄维斯特。,It is unclear if Rock was trying to mock West with the posting.
8804,同时，维斯特向观众抱怨因为戴着帽子，在后台度过了一段艰难的时刻。,"Also, West had complained to the audience that he had got a hard time backstage about his head wear."
8805,据《华盛顿观察家报》报道，他说“他们在后台欺负我。,"""They bullied me backstage."
8806,他们说，‘别带着那顶帽子出去’。,"They said, 'don't go out there with that hat on.'"
8807,他们欺负我！,They bullied me!
8808,然后他们说我陷入了困境”。,"And then they say I'm in a sunken place,"" he said, according to the Washington Examiner."
8809,维斯特继续道：“你们想知道什么是困境吗？”他说那将“穿上我的超人斗篷，因为这意味着你们将无法命令我如何去做。你们希望世界向前发展吗？,"West went on: ""You wanna see the sunken place?"" saying that he would ""put my superman cape on, because this means you can't tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?"
8810,试着去爱吧”。,"Try love."""
8811,据《Variety》报道，他的点评至少两次引发了观众的嘘声，SNL 演艺人员似乎感觉很尴尬，其中一人告诉本报记者：“整个演播室陷入死一般的沉默。”,"His comments drew boos at least twice from the audience and SNL cast members appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: ""The entire studio fell dead silent."""
8812,维斯特受邀作为歌手爱莉安娜·格兰德 (Ariana Grande) 的最新补位者，格兰德的前男友，说唱歌手迈克·米勒 (Mac Miller) 于几日前去世。,"West had been brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago."
8813,维斯特打扮成毕雷矿泉水瓶 (Perrier Bottle)，演唱了歌曲《I love It》，这一举动令很多人感到困惑。,"West puzzled many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier Bottle."
8814,维斯特获得了保守组织 TPUSA 负责人坎迪斯·特纳 (Candace Turner) 的支持，特纳在推特上写道：“向最无畏的人致敬：感谢你勇敢抵抗暴徒。”,"West got backing from head of conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: ""To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP TO THE MOB."""
8815,但是脱口秀主持人凯伦·亨特 (Karen Hunter) 在推特上写到，维斯特只是“勇敢做自己，这简直是棒极了”。,"But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply ""being who he is and that's absolutely wonderful."""
8816,“但我不会奖励（购买他的音乐、服装或支持他的“艺术”）那些我认为正在接受和传播有害于我所在社区的意识形态的人。,"""But I chose NOT to reward someone (by purchasing his music or clothing or supporting his ""art"") who I believe is embracing and spewing ideology that is harmful to my community."

8819,在演出之前，这位说唱歌手在推特上宣布，他改名了，并宣称他现在“正式成为了坎耶·维斯特 (Kanye West)”。,"Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now ""the being formally known as Kanye West."""
8820,他并不是第一个改名的艺人，此前 Diddy （又名 Puff Daddy、Puffy 或 P Diddy）也曾改名。,"He is not the first artist to change their name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy."
8821,同为说唱歌手的史诺普·道格 (Snoop Dogg) 曾用名为史诺普·利昂 (Snoop Lion)，当然还有已故音乐才子普林斯 (Prince)，他将自己的名字改成了一个符号，而在此之前这位艺人被称为普林斯。,"Fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg has had the name Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince."

8827,《权力的游戏》影星 Kit Harington 猛烈抨击“有毒的”男子气概,Game of Thrones star Kit Harington hits out at toxic masculinity
8828,Kit Harington 以 HBO 的中世纪剧情类连续剧《权力的游戏》中所饰演的 Jon Snow 而为大众所知，剧中他是持剑的英雄。,Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
8829,现年 31 岁的 Kit 已经对人们对他的刻板印象——硬汉式的英雄——这一现象猛烈抨击，他说，屏幕上的这类角色意味着，年轻人总是觉得，必须表现得很冷酷，才能受到尊重。,"But the actor, 31, has hit out at the stereotype of the macho hero, saying such roles on screen mean young boys often feel like they have to be tough to be respected."
8830,Kit 在《星期日泰晤士报》文化专栏中表示，他相信“出了问题”，并抛出了这样一个问题，即如何解决 #MeToo（唯我）个性时代这种“有毒的”男儿气概问题。,"Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes 'something's gone wrong' and questioned how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era."
8831,Kit 最近迎娶了《权力的游戏》中联袂主演的的影星（与其同岁）Rose Leslie。Kit 承认，他有种“非常强烈”的感觉，需要解决这个问题。,"Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he feels 'quite strongly' about addressing the issue."
8832,“此刻，我个人有种非常强烈的感觉，我们的男子气概哪里出了问题？”他说道。,"'I feel personally, quite strongly, at the moment - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?,' he said."
8833,“从我们眼下所认识到的这个问题来看，在孩子们成长的过程中，我们一直在教他们什么？”,"'What have we been teaching men when they're growing up, in terms of the problem we see now?'"
8834,Kit 认为，“有毒的”男儿气概之所以如此盛行，电视可能要负主要责任，因为由于电视里展现的个性非常男性化。,Kit believes television may be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters.
8835,他继续介绍称：“哪些是天生的，哪些是后天学习的？,He continued: 'What's innate and what's taught?
8836,电视和大街上都在展现什么，让这些年轻人觉得自己非得这样表现，才算得上是男人？,"What is taught on TV, and in the streets, that makes young boys feel they have to be this certain side of being a man?"
8837,我认为这确实是我们这个时代一个最为严重的问题，我们该如何改变这一点？,I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change that?
8838,因为年轻人明显出现了问题。,Because clearly something has gone wrong for young men.'
8839,在采访中他还承认，这一季的《权力的游戏》将于明年夏天杀青，之后，他将不再参演任何前传或续集，称自己“厌倦了战场和战马”。,"In the interview he also admitted that he wouldn't be doing any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, saying he is 'done with battlefields and horses'."
8840,从 11 月开始，Kit 将参演 Sam Shepard《True West》的翻拍，讲述的是一位电影制片人和他身为强盗的兄弟之间的故事。,"From November Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber."
8841,Kit 最近透露，他觉得出演《权力的游戏》，最幸福的事就是遇到了他的妻子 Rose。,The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
8842,“我在这部电视剧中，遇到了我的妻子，也因此给了我之后的家人，以及现在的生活”，他说道。,"'I met my wife in this show, so in that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on in,' he said."
8843,在《权力的游戏》中，Rose 扮演的是 Kit 所饰演的角色 Jon Snow 的恋人 Ygritte。《权力的游戏》斩获了艾美奖剧情类最佳剧集奖。,"Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series."
8844,这对夫妇于 2018 年 6 月，在苏格兰 Leslie 的家族庄园举行了婚礼。,The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.

8847,中国卫计委报告，中国有超过 82 万艾滋病感染患者。,"More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say."
8848,"仅在 2018 年第二季度，就报道新增大约 40,000 个患者。","About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone."
8849,绝大多数新感染者都是通过性行为传播的，这可谓历史性的变化。,"The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past."
8850,过去，中国部分地区艾滋病传播迅速的主要途径是感染血液的传输。,"Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions."
8851,中国国家卫计委在云南省举行的一次会议上介绍称，通过这种方式感染艾滋病毒的人数几乎已将为零。,"But the number of people contracting HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province."
8852,但与此同时，中国艾滋病病毒感染者相比去年却增加了 10 万人。,"Year-on-year, however, the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has risen by 100,000 people."
8853,对于中国的 LGBT 人群而言，性行为传播艾滋病毒成为了一个严重问题。,HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in China's LGBT community.
8854,1997 年，中国将同性恋合法化，但对 LGBT 人群的歧视现象仍然普遍存在。,"Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rife."
8855,中国的价值观相对保守，据研究估计，有 70-90％ 与男性发生性关系的男性，最终的结婚对象为女性。,"Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women."
8856,许多疾病的传播皆源于这类关系中性保护的不足。,Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
8857,自 2003 年以来，中国政府承诺普及艾滋病药物，解决这一问题。,"Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to tackle the issue."
8858,Maxine Waters 否认手下泄露共和党参议员信息，引发“危险的谎言”和“阴谋论”,"Maxine Waters denies staffer leaked GOP senators' data, blasts 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'"
8859,周六，针对众议院成员将三位共和党美国参议员的个人信息公布在了议员的维基百科页面上的说法，美国众议员 Maxine Waters 提出谴责。,U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators onto the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
8860,Maxine Waters （洛杉矶民主党人）称，这一说法招致了“极右翼”专家和网站的批判。,"The Los Angeles Democrat asserted that the claims were being pedaled by ""ultra-right wing"" pundits and websites."
8861,Waters 在 Twitter 的一份声明中说道，“谎言、谎言，全都是卑鄙的谎言”。,"""Lies, lies, and more despicable lies,"" Waters said in a statement on Twitter."
8862,据报道，已公布的信息包括南卡罗来纳州的美国参议员 Lindsey Graham 以及犹他州的 Mike Lee 和 Orrin Hatch 的家庭住址和电话号码。,"The released information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah."
8863,这些信息是在周四从国会山上发布到网上的，发布者为针对最高法院提名候选人布雷特·卡瓦诺 (Brett Kavanaugh) 性行为不端的指控，而举行的参议院小组听证会上一名参会的不知名者。,"The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel's hearing on the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh."
8864,信息泄露于三位参议员质问卡瓦诺之后的某个时间。,The leak came sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
8865,据 Hill 报道，Gateway Pundit 和 RedState 等保守网站的报告称，已确定，信息发布设备的 IP 地址与 Waters 的办公室有关，并公布了 Waters 的一位员工的信息。,"Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters"" office and released the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported."
8866,Waters 继续说道：“这一说法简直是无稽之谈，彻头彻尾的假话，绝对的谎言。”,"""This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie,"" Waters continued."
8867,“我手下的工作人员绝对不是泄露这些信息的人，这一说法是骗人的谎话，却损害了他们的身份、个人信息和安全。,"""The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information."
8868,这一说法简直是无稽之谈，彻头彻尾的假话，绝对的谎言。”,"This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."""
8869,Waters 的声明很快便引来了网友的批评，包括前白宫新闻发言人 Ari Fleischer。,"Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer."
8870,Fleischer 写道：“她的否认之词中充满了愤怒。”,"""This denial is angry,"" Fleischer wrote."
8871,“这说明，她的脾气不适合担任国会议员。,"""This suggests she doesn't have the temperment to be a Member of Congress."
8872,受到他人的指控，而自己是冤枉的情况下，最要不得的就是愤怒。,"When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they must not be angry."
8873,不得目中无人。,They must not be defiant.
8874,不得质疑指控者的动机。,They must not question the motives of the accuser.
8875,必须冷静沉着。”,"They must be calm and serene."""
8876,Fleischer 似乎是在将Waters 的反应与民主党对卡瓦诺法官的批评进行比较，卡瓦诺法官在周四听证会上的表现，被批评者指责似乎过于愤怒。,"Fleischer was appearing to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of seeming too angry during Thursday's hearing."
8877,在中期选举中有意取代 Waters 的共和党候选人 Omar Navarro，也在 Twitter 上发表了自己的看法。,"Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter."
8878,他在 Twitter 中称“若真是那样，就用不着这么夸大”。,"""Big if true,"" he tweeted."
8879,Waters 在声明中表示，她的办公室已提醒“有关当局和执法机构，这些说法都具有欺诈性”。,"In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted ""the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent claims."
8880,她继续道，“我们要确保找到罪魁祸首，让他们对自己的所作所为负法律责任，他们对我和我手下的员工造成了破坏性的影响”。,"""We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed,"" she continued, ""and that they will be held legally liable for all of their actions that are destructible and dangerous to any and all members of my staff."""
8881,《憨豆特工 3 之东山再起》影评：罗温·艾金森再塑搞笑间谍形象,Johnny English Strikes Again review - underpowered Rowan Atkinson spy spoof
8882,当前的电影都会反映出一些英国脱欧的意义，倾向于英国立场。这部英语动作喜剧恶搞系列电影《憨豆特工》同样如此。第一部《憨豆特工》于 2003 年上映，2011 年上映于第二部。,It's traditional now to look for Brexit significances in any new film with a British slant and that does seem applicable to this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and spluttered back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
8883,这种玩笑式地讽刺没有新的出口机会，讽刺了我们是多么的一文不值？,Will tongue-in-cheek self-satire on the subject of how obviously rubbish we are be the nation's new export opportunity?
8884,无论如何，这位瞪着大眼、面无表情什么能力也没有的约翰尼·英格利士再次获得了许可，将事情搞的一塌糊涂。他的名字更具表现力，恰恰说明了创作这个广为人知的喜剧人物，针对的就是非英语观影人士。,"At any rate, the pop-eyed, rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English has had his licence to cock things up renewed for the second time - that name of his signalling more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinemagoing territories."
8885,尽管他自命不凡地想装得优雅绅士，魅力不凡，还是摆脱不了愚蠢的秘密特工形象，让人看到了克鲁索、憨豆，还有那个演奏 2012 年伦敦奥运会开幕式主题曲《火战车》 (Chariots of Fire) 的小伙子。,"He is of course the daft secret agent who despite his bizarre pretensions to smoothie glamour has got a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a dollop of that chap contributing a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme tune at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony."
8886,最初他还是巴克莱卡电视广告中旅游者和国际神秘男艾金森，总是制造一堆烂摊子，虽然这些广告已被人忘却在了脑后。,"He's also originally based on the traveller and international man of mystery Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos in his wake."
8887,这部《憨豆特工》中，英格利士外出时有一两处亮点。,There are one or two nice moments in this latest JE outing.
8888,我喜欢约翰尼·英格利士穿着中世纪的盔甲靠近直升机时，旋转叶片打在他的头盔上，发出一阵阵的叮当声。,I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter while dressed in a medieval suit of armour and the rotor blades briefly clanging against his helmet.
8889,艾金森的动作喜剧天赋有目共睹，但幽默感相当不足，很奇怪，很牵强，特别是像《007》和《谍中谍》这类“严肃”电影品牌，现在也自信地融入了喜剧成分。,"Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but the humour feels pretty underpowered and weirdly superfluous, especially as the ""serious"" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now confidently offer comedy as an ingredient."
8890,这种幽默感针对的对象更像是儿童，而不是成年人。我个人觉得，相比艾金森在无声电影中饰演的憨豆所闹出的笑话，约翰尼·英格利士各种古怪的出洋相事件，创造性和凝聚力匮乏。,"The humour feels as if it is pitched at kids rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's wacky misadventures aren't as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent-movie gags in the persona of Bean."
8891,现在常年的主题都是以英国陷入严重的困境为主旋律。,The perennially topical premise now is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
8892,一名网络黑客渗透到英国的超级秘密间谍网络，暴露了所有英国特工的身份，这让当班特工——Kevin Eldon 所饰演的一个小角色——伤透了脑筋。,"A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent on duty - a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon."
8893,片中的首相角色表现浮夸，问题缠身，政治上不得人心：Emma Thompson 竭尽全力从外表上，表现出这个特蕾莎·梅的角色特点，但影片中并没有一句台词。,"It's the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and embattled figure, already suffering a complete meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but there's nothing much in the script to work with."
8894,她的情报顾问告诉她，所有现役间谍都暴露了身份，只能从已经退休的特工里找出一个人来担当重任。,"Her intelligence advisers inform her that as every single active spy has been compromised, she will have to bring someone out of retirement."
8895,唯一选择就是笨手笨脚的强尼·英格利士，现在他已改行，在一家豪华机构担任校长，但却在私下里教授如何成为一名卧底特工：这里的包袱很新奇，因为英格利士开设了一所摇滚校园型的间谍学院。,"And that means bumbling Johnny English himself, now employed as a schoolmaster in some posh establishment, but giving off-the-record lessons in how to be an undercover operative: some nice gags here, as English offers a School of Rock-type academy of spying."
8896,英格利士被迅速带回白厅，参加一次紧急情况发布会，并与吃了不少苦头的老朋友博夫 (Bough)（再次由本?米勒 (Ben Miller) 饰演）重聚。,"English is whisked back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former long-suffering sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller."
8897,鲍夫如今已成了家，对 Vicki Pepperdine 有点浪费。鲍夫现在是一个已婚男人，妻子是一名潜艇指挥官，这个角色有些哗众取宠，由 Vicki Pepperdine 出演有点儿屈才了。,"Bough is now a married man, hitched to a submarine commander, a jolly-hockey-sticks role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted."
8898,这样，在女王陛下的特工部犯下大错的蝙蝠侠和罗宾又回来了，而后，他们又邂逅了 Olga Kurylenko 饰演的蛇蝎美人奥菲莉亚·布里托娃 (Ophelia Bulletova)。,"So the Batman and Robin of getting things terribly wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova."
8899,与此同时，在魅力超凡的科技业亿万富翁——杰克?莱西 (Jake Lacy) 饰演的阴险人物詹森?沃尔塔 (Jason Volta)——的蛊惑下，英国首相处境堪忧。,"Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling dangerously under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer woes: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy."
8900,英格利士和鲍夫开始了他们滑稽的狂欢之旅：他们伪装成服务员，放火烧了一家金碧辉煌的法国餐厅；在伏尔塔的豪华游艇上制造了混乱的自杀行为；在使用虚拟现实耳机熟悉 Volta 家的内部时，英格利士引发了纯粹的无政府状态。,"English and Bough begin their odyssey of farcical high-jinks: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a flash French restaurant; they create mayhem smuggling themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers pure anarchy as he attempts to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarise himself with the interior of Volta's house."
8901,所有悬念在最后都一下子解开了，那样和谐，那样热闹，但整体上，却只停留在了低幼儿童剧的层级。,"All the stops are certainly pulled out for that last sequence, but as amiable and boisterous as it is, there's quite a bit of kids' TV about the whole thing."
8902,整体评价不过平平。,Pretty moderate stuff.
8903,和其他两部《憨豆特工》电影一样，我不禁陷入沉思：英国电影业就不能给罗温·艾金森一个配得上他的角色吗？,And as with the other Johnny English films I couldn't help thinking: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
8904,工党否认并未制定英国工资不减“上四休三”计划,Labour denies it is devising a plan for Britons to work a four day week but be paid for five days
8905,Jeremy Corbyn 的工党将考虑实施一项激进的计划，英国人每周工作四天，但工资不减。,Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan which will see Britons working a four day week - but getting paid for five.
8906,据报道，工党希望企业将利用人工智能 (AI) 所省下的开支，用于为工作者多提供一天休息日。,The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
8907,这样一来，员工一周可以享受为期三天的周末，同时带回家的薪水仍然不变。,It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but still take home the same pay.
8908,消息人士称，这一想法与工党的经济议程“相符合”，而且计划将向英国的工人倾斜。,Sources said the idea would 'fit' with the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.
8909,实行四天工作日的计划得到了英国工会联盟 (TUC) 的支持，这样，工人能从经济转变中获得利益。,Shifting to a four-day week has been endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
8910,工党一位高级消息人士想《星期日泰晤士报》介绍称：“预计将于年底前公布政策审查结果。,A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
8911,“此举不可能一蹴而就，不过‘上四休三’这种工作制符合工党向工人利益倾斜的目标以及工党的整体工业战略。”,'It won't happen overnight but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits in with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.'
8912,工党并非第一个支持这种想法的党派，绿党在 2017 年大选期间便承诺要推出‘上四休三’工作制。,"The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party pledging a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign."
8913,然而，这一计划目前尚未得到整个工党的支持。,"The aspiration is currently not being endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole, however."
8914,一位工党发现人表示：“‘上四休三’的工作制并非政党政策，工党目前尚未考虑。”,A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day working week is not party policy and it is not being considered by the party.'
8915,影子大臣 John McDonnell 在上周的工党会议上，具体介绍了他对社会主义经济革命的看法。,Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to flesh out his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
8916,McDonnell 表示，他决心夺回公用事业企业中“不露面的董事”和“奸商”手中的权力。,Mr McDonnell said he was determined to claw back power from 'faceless directors' and 'profiteers' at utility firms.
8917,McDonnell 的计划同时意味着，水务公司的现有股东可能无法收回他们的全部股份，因为工党政府可能会以不道德行为为由对其“扣减”。,The shadow chancellor's plans also mean current shareholders in water companies may not get back their entire stake as a Labour government could make 'deductions' on the grounds of perceived wrongdoing.
8918,"他同时还确认，计划支持工人担任公司董事会，创建“包容性所有权基金 (inclusive ownership funds)""，将 10％ 的私营企业股权交给员工，这样员工可以从中抽取高达 500 英镑的年度股息。","He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to hand 10 per cent of private-sector firms' equity to employees, who stand to pocket annual dividends of up to £500."
8919,林赛·格雷厄姆与约翰·肯尼迪在《60 分钟》节目中坦言 FBI 对卡瓦诺的调查能否影响他们的决定,"Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell ""60 Minutes"" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds"
8920,FBI 对布雷特·卡瓦诺 (Brett Kavanaugh) 法官的指控罪名进行调查，迫使美国最高法院大法官提名的最终投票推迟了至少一周，同时，让人们开始好奇，FBI 的调查结果是否会动摇共和党参议员对布雷特·卡瓦诺的支持。,"The FBI investigation into accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises the question of whether the bureau's findings could sway any Republican senators into pulling their support."
8921,在周日播出的访谈节目《60 分钟》中，记者 Scott Pelley 询问共和党议员约翰·肯尼迪 (John Kennedy) 和林赛·格雷厄姆 (Lindsey Graham)，FBI 的调查结果，会不会影响他们的决定。,"In an interview airing Sunday, ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republicans Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could unearth anything that would lead them to change their minds."
8922,肯尼迪比格雷厄姆（来自南卡罗来纳州）的主意更开放些。,Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
8923,“当然了，”肯尼迪说道。,"""I mean, of course,"" said Kennedy."
8924,“我说了要去参加听证会，我说了，我已经跟卡瓦诺谈过了。,"""I said going into the hearing, I said, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh."
8925,我在事后，指控发布后，就打电话问他，‘你做过没有？’,"I called him after this happened, that allegation came out, said, 'Did you do it?'"
8926,他很果断、很坚定、很明确。“,"He was resolute, determined, unequivocal."""
8927,然而，格雷厄姆的投票似乎已经是板上钉钉了。,"Graham's vote, however, appears set in stone."
8928,“对于布雷特·卡瓦诺的投票，我已经拿好主意了，就算是投毒防火的罪名，我也不会改变主意，”他说道。,"""My mind's made up about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite accusation,"" he said."
8929,“福特博士，我不知道真相到底是什么，但我清楚的是：布雷特坚称自己没有做过”，格雷厄姆补充道。言语中的福特博士指的是克里斯汀·布莱西·福特 (Christine Blasey Ford)。,"""Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it vigorously,"" Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford."
8930,“她所说的每个人都无法验证她说的是否属实。,"""And everybody she names couldn't verify it."
8931,是个 36 年了。,It's 36 years old.
8932,改变不了什么。”,"I don't see anything new changing."""
8933,什么是全球公民音乐节，它为减少贫困做出了哪些贡献？,What is the Global Citizen Festival and Has it Done Anything to Decrease Poverty?
8934,本周六，纽约将举办全球公民音乐节，全球公民音乐节是一场年度音乐盛典，有着非常令人印象深刻的明星表演阵容和同样令人印象深刻的使命：消除世界贫困。,"This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event which has a hugely impressive line-up of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; ending world poverty."
8935,今年，第 17 届全球公民音乐节将吸引成千上万民众涌入中央公园的大草坪，在欣赏珍妮·杰克逊 (Janet Jackson)、卡迪·B (Cardi B) 和肖恩·蒙德兹 (Shawn Mendes) 等人表演的同时，提高人们对本次活动真正目的的认识，即在 2030 年之前消除极端贫困。,"Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy acts such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030."
8936,2012 年确立的全球公民音乐节是全球扶贫项目的延伸，全球扶贫项目 (Global Poverty Project) 是一个国际宣传组织，旨在通过提高积极对抗贫困的人口数量来消除贫困。,"The Global Citizen Festival, which stated in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it."
8937,如要获得活动的免费门票（除非您想支付 VIP 门票的费用），观众必须完成一系列任务或“行动”，如志愿活动、给世界领导人发邮件、打电话或通过任何其他有意义的方式帮助提高人们对其消除贫困这一目标的认识。,"In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, or ""actions"" such volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty."
8938,但是，距离实现目标只剩下 12 年的时间，Global Citizen 到底能否成功？,But just how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
8939,用一场免费的音乐会作为奖励能够说服人们采取行动吗，或者只是所谓的“网络点击行动主义”（人们通过签署网上请愿书或发送推文，感觉自己真正有所作为）的另一种说辞？,"Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called ""clicktivism"" - people feeling like they are making a true difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?"
8940,"自 2011 年以来，Global Citizen 称其已经记录了来自支持者的 1,900 多万项推动实现众多不同目标的“行动”。","Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million ""actions"" from its supporters, pushing for a host of different goals."
8941,Global Citizen 表示，这些行动已经帮助促进世界领导人发布等价于 370 多亿美元的承诺和政策，而这些承诺和政策将在 2030 年之前影响超过 22.5 亿人口的生活。,It says that these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equating to more than $37 billion that is set to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
8942,在 2018 年年初，该组织表彰了其行动中的 390 项承诺和公告，其中至少已经支付或募捐了 100 亿美元。,"In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been disbursed or fundraised."
8943,该组织预计，到目前为止，筹得资金将对全球近 6.49 亿人口产生直接影响。,The group estimates the secured funds have so far made a direct impact on nearly 649 million people across the world.
8944,"其中一些关键承诺包括 The Power of Nutrition，一项英国投资者和实施者之间的合作伙伴关系，其致力于“帮助儿童充分发挥成长潜能”，并在收到来自全球公民的 4,700 多条推文后，承诺为卢旺达资助 3,500 万美元以帮助消除该国的营养不良现象。","Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a U.K. based partnership of investors and implementers committed to ""helping children grow to their full potential,"" promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens."
8945,在 2018 年 4 月于伦敦举行的一场演唱会上，The Power of Nutrition 大使特蕾西·厄尔曼 (Tacey Ullman) 诉大家，“有了英国政府、捐赠人、各国政府以及众多与您一样的全球公民的支持，营养不良的社会不公现象即将成为历史的脚注”。,"""With support from the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history,"" The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018."
8946,"该组织也表示，在采取了 5,000 多项呼吁英国政府改善母亲和儿童的营养状况的行动后，政府宣布成立 The Power of Nutrition 项目，该项目将对 500 万妇女和儿童采取营养干预。","The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on the U.K. improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions."
8947,为了回应网站上的一个常见问题“你们凭什么认为我们能够消除极端贫困”？,"In response to one of the FAQs on its website asking ""what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"""
8948,Global Citizen 回复到：“这将是一条漫长而艰难的道路 - 有时我们甚至会跌倒和失败。,"Global citizen replied: ""It'll be a long and hard path - sometimes we will fall and fail."
8949,但是，与我们面前的伟大民权和反种族隔离运动一样，我们一定会成功，因为我们团结起来将更加强大。,"But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together."
8950,珍妮·杰克逊 (Janet Jackson)、盆栽精 (the Weeknd)、肖恩·蒙德兹 (Shawn Mendes)、卡迪·B (Cardi B) 和杰奈尔·莫娜 (Janelle Monáe) 将担任行的音乐节活动的表演嘉宾，本次音乐节将由黛博拉-李·福奈丝 (Deborra-Lee Furness) 和休·杰克曼 (Hugh Jackman) 主持。,"Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the acts performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman."
8951,内政部长表示，美国将出动海军进行“封锁”，以阻止俄罗斯的能源出口,"US could use Navy for ""blockade"" to hamper Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary"
8952,据《华盛顿观察家报》报道，美国内政部长瑞安·津凱 (Ryan Zinke) 透露，“如有必要”华盛顿方面可以出动海军，阻止俄罗斯能源冲击包括中东在内的市场。,"Washington can ""if necessary"" resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy hitting the markets, including in the Middle East, US Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as cited by Washington Examiner."
8953,津凱声称，俄罗斯在叙利亚的活动 - 尤其是应叙利亚合法政府的邀请所开展的活动 - 不过是探索新能源市场的托词。,"Zinke alleged that Russia's engagement in Syria - notably, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets."
8954,据报道，津凱曾表示：“我认为，俄方插手中东问题，是因为他们想重复在东欧的行径，充当欧洲南方腹地的能源代理”。,"""I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is they want to broker energy just like they do in eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe,"" he has reportedly said."
8955,据官方表示，解决这一问题有多种方法和手段。,"And, according to to the official, there are ways and means to tackle it."
8956,他表示，“美国有能力和我们的海军一起，确保海上航线畅通，并且如有必要，可以进行封锁，以确保俄罗斯的能源无法进入市场”。,"""The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to make sure the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to blockade, to make sure that their energy does not go to market,"" he said."
8957,津凱出席消费者能源联盟 (Consumer Energy Alliance) 主办的活动时发表讲话，消费者能源联盟 (Consumer Energy Alliance) 是一家非盈利组织，自称是美国“能源消费者的代言人”。,"Zinke was addressing the attendees of the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group which styles itself as the ""voice of the energy consumer"" in the US."
8958,他对比了华盛顿处理俄罗斯和伊朗问题的方法，指出二者实际上是相同的。,"He went to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same."
8959,“伊朗和俄罗斯的经济选择或多或少都是利用和替代燃料”，他表示，俄罗斯是一匹在经济上依赖化石燃料的“黑马”。,"""The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, leveraging and replacing fuels,"" he said, while referring to Russia as a ""one trick pony"" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels."
8960,上述声明是由于特朗普政府一直致力于推动液化天然气对欧洲的出口，以取代对欧洲消费者来说更为便宜的俄罗斯的地位。,"The statements come as Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers."
8961,为此，包括美国总统唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump) 本人在内的特朗普政府官员们试图说服德国退出“不合时宜的”北溪 2 号 (Nord Stream 2) 天然气管道项目，根据特朗普的说法，该项目将使柏林成为莫斯科的“垄断市场”。,"For that effect, the Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to pull out of the ""inappropriate"" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump, made Berlin Moscow's ""captive."""
8962,莫斯科一再强调，耗资 110 亿美元的北溪 2 号 (Nord Stream 2) 天然气管道只是一个纯粹的经济项目，旨在将现有管道容量翻倍扩增至 1100 亿立方米。,"Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project."
8963,克里姆林宫方面辩称，华盛顿方面对该项目的强烈反对，完全是出于经济原因，这是不公平竞争。,The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
8964,9 月，俄罗斯能源部长亚历山大·诺瓦克 (Aleksandr Novak) 在莫斯科与美国能源部长里克·佩里 (Rick Perry) 会晤后表示，“我相信，我们都承认，能源不能成为施加压力的工具，消费者应该拥有选择供应商的权利”。,"""I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers,"" Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September."
8965,美方的立场遭到德国的强烈反对，德国已重申其将加入该项目。,"The US stance has drawn backlash from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project."
8966,德国领先的工业组织 - 德国工业联合会 (BDI) 呼吁美国不要干涉欧盟的能源政策以及柏林和莫斯科之间的双边协议。,"Germany's leading organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from the EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow."
8967,德国工业联合会 (BDI) 主席迪特尔·肯普夫 (Dieter Kempf) 近期与德国总理安格拉·默克尔 (Angela Merkel) 和俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京 (Vladimir Putin) 会晤后表示，“如果第三国干预我们的能源供应，我们将面临大麻烦。”,"""I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply,"" Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) said following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin."

8972,“11 月 6 日后，我将严肃考虑总统大选。”,"""After November 6, I will take a hard look at running for president."""
8973,在市政厅就职期间提到唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump) 总统，沃伦称“他正在把我们国家带向错误的方向。,"Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the town hall, saying he was ""taking this county in the wrong direction."
8974,“对于唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump) 对民主所采取的措施，我深表担心”，沃伦说到。,"""I am worried down to my bones about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,"" she said."
8975,在对特朗普及其提名的最高法院候选人布雷特·卡瓦诺 (Brett Kavanaugh) 的指责中，沃伦直言不讳。,Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
8976,在周五的一条推文中，沃伦表示“当然，在投票之前，我们需要联邦调查局 (FBI) 进行调查”。,"In a tweet on Friday, Warren said ""of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."""
8977,然而，周四发布的民意调查结果显示，沃伦自己的大多数选民认为她不应该参与 2020 年的大选。,"A poll released on Thursday, however, showed a majority of Warren's own constituents do not think she should run in 2020."

8987,Palin 称他的被捕是“房间里的大象（指显而易见而又被忽略的事实）”，说她儿子和其他退伍军人“回来后，人就变了，他们想知道，作为士兵、飞行员以及军队其他所有成员的自己，那样尊重自己的祖国，那自己是否受到了同等的尊重呢。”,"Palin called his arrest ""the elephant in the room"" and said of her son and other war veterans, ""they come back a bit different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is that respect for what it is that their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the military, has given to the country."""

8994,她被拘留在得克萨斯州。,She was detained in Texas.
8995,支持格雷斯的各州律师表示，萨尔瓦多、洪都拉斯和危地马拉等国面临着普遍存在的帮派和家庭暴力问题，因此这些国家产生了大量申请美国庇护的人员。,"The states' attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence."

8998,“联邦法律要求所有的庇护申请都要根据申请的具体事实和情况进行裁决，该禁令违反了上述原则”，法庭之友简报表示。,"""Federal law requires that all asylum claims be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a bar violates that principle,"" the friend-of-the court brief said."
8999,在简报中律师们进一步辩称，拒绝移民入境的政策损害了美国的经济，这些人更有可能成为企业家，并“提供必要的劳动力”。,"Attorneys further argued in the brief that the policy denying immigrants entry hurts the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and ""supply necessary labor."""
9000,司法部长杰夫·塞申斯 (Jeff Sessions) 下令移民法官不得再为逃离家庭暴力和帮派暴力的受害者们提供庇护。,Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
9001,塞申斯在 6 月 11 日宣布这项政策时表示，“那些因种族、宗教、国籍或某个社会团体的成员身份或政治观点而受到迫害或恐惧进而离开自己国家的人员可以得到庇护”。,"""Asylum is available for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear on account of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,"" Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy."
9002,庇护从不是为了缓解全世界人民每天所面临的所有问题，即便是所有严重的问题。,Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems -- even all serious problems -- that people face every day all over the world.

9019,美国总统唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump) 上周三提到《中国日报》在《得梅因纪事报》（爱荷华州销量最大的报纸）上发表付费增刊，指责中国试图干预 11 月 6 日举行的美国国会选举，而后中国方面否认了这一指控。,"U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's biggest selling newspaper - after accusing China of seeking to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, a charge China denies."
9020,特朗普指责北京方面试图干预美国选举，标志着美国官员向路透社所说的情况进入了一个新的阶段，华盛顿向中国的施压不断升级。,Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
9021,尽管外国政府为促进贸易而发布广告的情况十分常见，但北京和华盛顿目前正陷于一场不断升级的贸易战，双方已对彼此的进口产品征收了数轮关税。,"While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has seen them level rounds of tariffs on each other's imports."
9022,中美专家表示，在贸易战初期，中国的报复性关税旨在打击爱荷华等州支持特朗普的共和党的出口商。,"China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts have said."
9023,美国驻华大使、爱荷华州前长期州长、对华农产品主要出口商泰里·布兰斯塔德 (Terry Branstad) 表示，北京方面的举动伤害了美国的工人、农民和企业。,"Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses."
9024,布兰斯塔德在周日出版的《得梅因纪事报》上发表的一篇评论文章中写道，中国“正通过在我们自己的自由媒体上刊登政治宣传广告，加大欺凌的力度”。,"China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, ""is now doubling down on that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press."""
9025,“在政治宣传方面，中国政府正在利用美国珍视的言论自由和新闻自由的传统，在《得梅因纪事报》上刊登付费广告”，布兰斯塔德写到。,"""In disseminating its propaganda, China's government is availing itself of America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,"" Branstad wrote."
9026,“相比之下，你很少会在北京街头的书报摊上看到反对的声音，也无法看到中国人民对中国令人担忧的经济发展轨迹所持不同意见的真实反映，因为媒体处于中国共产党严格的监控之下”，他写到。,"""In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's troubling economic trajectory, given that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,"" he wrote."
9027,他补充到，“中国最著名的报纸甚至拒绝出版他的文章”，但他没有说明是哪家报纸。,"He added that ""one of China's most prominent newspapers dodged the offer to publish"" his article, although he did not say which newspaper."

9030,这一事件引发的情绪十分高涨，记录在案的大多数共和党人已经表明他们想获得选票走下去。,"The emotions surrounding this have been extremely high, and most Republicans are on record already showing they wanted to go forward with a vote."
9031,在周六发表的一篇文章中，雪城大学麦斯威尔学院的格兰特·赖尔 (Grant Reeher) 教授向《国会山报》透露称，“这些事情不可能有回头路”。,"Those things can't be walked back,"" Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School told The Hill for an article published Saturday."
9032,赖尔表示，他怀疑参议员杰夫·弗雷克 (Jeff Flake)（亚利桑那州共和党人士）在紧急关头奋力争取联邦调查局 (FBI) 的调查将足以安抚选民们的愤怒情绪。,Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-minute push for an FBI investigation will be enough to placate angry voters.
9033,据华盛顿特区报纸报道，进步组织 MoveOn 的高级顾问兼国家发言人卡琳·让-皮埃尔 (Karine Jean-Pierre) 于周五表示，“妇女们永远都不会忘记过去发生的事情 - 明天无法忘记，整个 11 月份都无法忘记”。,"""Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November,"" Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper."
9034,据 MIC 报道，尽管有克里斯汀·布莱西·福特 (Christine Blasey Ford) 博士的证词，但控制着司法委员会的共和党人仍选择继续支持卡瓦诺的提名，导致周五早上发生与参议院走廊上如出一辙的游行示威，抗议者们高呼“11 月到了！”。,"On Friday morning, protestors chanted ""November is coming!"" as they demonstrated in the hallway of the Senate as the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported."

9036,“人们说热情已经十分高涨了；这没错。,"""People are saying it's already been high; that's true."
9037,但热情还能更高，特别是郊区地区举棋不定的女性选民和年轻选民（18 - 29 岁），通常当他们不喜欢总统时，这些人便不会投票”。,"But it could be higher, particularly among swing women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who while they don't like the president, often don't vote."""
9038,在福特的公开证词详细说明其对最高法院候选人有关性侵的指控之前，分析人士就曾警告称如果共和党继续推行表决，那么将引发强烈的反对。,"Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed forward with the confirmation."
9039,据美国全国广播公司新闻 (NBC News) 报道，共和党全国委员会前主席迈克尔·斯蒂尔 (Michael Steele) 表示“这将为大老党 (GOP) 带来混乱局面”。,"""This has become a muddled mess for the GOP,"" said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News."
9040,优先美国行动（Priorities USA，一个帮助选举民主党人的组织）主管盖伊·塞西尔 (Guy Cecil) 向新闻频道指出，“这不仅仅关乎委员会的投票或最终投票结果，或者是否会将卡瓦诺放在替补席位上，也关乎共和党处理这一问题的方式以及他们对待受害者的方式”。,"""It's just not about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it's also about the way Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her,"" Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats, pointed out to the news channel."
9041,然而，随着福特和卡瓦诺的证词相继出炉，对于应该相信谁，美国民众似乎产生了一些分歧，稍稍倾向于后者。,"However, Americans appear to be somewhat split over who to believe in the wake of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with slightly more siding with the latter."
9042,YouGov 的最新民意调查显示，41% 的调查对象明确或可能相信福特的证词，而 35% 的调查对象表示他们明确或可能相信卡瓦诺。,"A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh."
9043,此外，38% 的调查对象表示他们认为卡瓦诺的证词中可能或一定说了谎，而只有 30% 的调查对象表示他们认为福特的证词中可能或一定说了谎。,"Additionally, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while just 30 percent said the same about Ford."
9044,据《卫报》报道，在弗雷克的争取下，联邦调查局 (FBI) 目前正在对福特以及至少一名其他控告者，黛博拉·拉米雷斯 (Deborah Ramirez) 提出的指控进行调查。,"After the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations brought forward by Ford as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported."
9045,上周，福特在参议院司法委员会面前宣誓作证，证明卡瓦诺曾在她 17 岁时醉酒后强奸了她。,Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh drunkenly assaulted her at the age of 17.
9046,拉米雷斯指控最高法院候选人曾在 20 世纪 80 年代他们就读于耶鲁大学期间，在派对上向她裸露生殖器。,Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while they attended a party during their time studying at Yale in the 1980s.

9115,“但你知道吗，还有比奥运会金牌更重大的事。,"""You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals."
9116,Robbie 就是我的奥运金牌。”,"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."""

9125,球感欠佳的米克尔森周六在莱德杯上被换下场,Out-of-form Mickelson benched on Ryder Cup Saturday
9126,美国球员菲尔·米克尔森 (Phil Mickelson) 将在周日他的第 47 场莱德杯比赛中创造纪录，但他必须调整自己的状态，避免上演负面的里程碑事件。,"American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to turn his form around to avoid it being an unhappy milestone."
9127,米克尔森，第 12 次参加这项两年一度的赛事，在周六的四人四球赛和四人两球赛中被队长吉姆·福瑞克 (Jim Furyk) 替换下场。,"Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes."
9128,这位五次大满贯得主不但没有像在美国时一样成为比赛的中坚力量，反而把一天的时间都花费在了拉拉队和训练场上，希望尽快纠正自己的问题重返赛场。,"Instead of being at the center of the action, as he so often has been for the United States, the five-times major winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game on the range in the hope of rectifying what ails him."
9129,即便在职业生涯的巅峰时期，手持最笔直的高尔夫球杆，气氛紧张的法国国家高尔夫球场 (Le Golf National) 也不适合这位 48 岁的选手，这里高低不平的路线会为偏离轨道的射击增加难度。,"Never the straightest of drivers even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal fit for the tight Le Golf National course, where the long rough routinely punishes errant shots."
9130,如果球场本身不够威严，米克尔森将在周日的第九场比赛中对战精准的英国高尔夫公开赛冠军弗兰西斯科·莫里纳利 (Francesco Molinari)，弗兰西斯科·莫里纳利已经与新手汤米·弗利特伍德 (Tommy Fleetwood ) 合作拿下了他们本周四场比赛的全部胜利。,"And if the course on its own is not daunting enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week."
9131,如果美国队以四分的落差开始 12 场单打比赛，那么若要打出良好的开局，米克尔森的比赛将至关重要。,"If the Americans, four points down starting the 12 singles matches, get off to a hot start, Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial."
9132,福瑞克表示对自己的队员有信心，但除此之外他无话可说。,"Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much else."
9133,“他完全理解自己今天所扮演的角色，拍了拍我的背，用手臂搂住我说他明天一定会准备好”，福瑞克说到。,"""He fully understood the role that he had today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,"" Furyk said."
9134,“他对自己非常有信心。,"""He's got a lot of confidence in himself."
9135,他是名人堂 (Hall of Famer) 的一员，过去为团队做出了巨大贡献，本周也是。,"He's a Hall of Famer and he's added so much to these teams in the past, and this week."
9136,我可能没指望他会打两场比赛。,I probably didn't envision him playing two matches.
9137,我希望他打更多比赛，但结果就是这样，也是不得不接受。,"I envisioned more, but that's the way it worked out and that's the way we thought we had to go."
9138,和其他人一样，他也想在赛场上大放异彩。”,"He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."""
9139,周日，米克尔森将打破尼克·福尔多 (Nick Faldo) 创下的莱德杯比赛场次最多的记录。,Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
9140,这可能标志着莱德杯职业生涯的结束，而他的个人记录却从未达到如此的高度。,It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched the heights of his individual record.
9141,米克尔森取得了 18 胜 20 负 7 平的成绩，尽管福瑞克说他的出现给球队带来了一些无形的力量。,"Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, though Furyk said his presence brought some intangibles to the team."
9142,“他滑稽、尖酸、诙谐、喜欢取笑别人，在队里是个大好人”，他解释到。,"""He's funny, he's sarcastic, witty, likes to poke fun at people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room,"" he explained."
9143,“我想年轻的球员们很喜欢戏弄他，而在本周，这将很有趣。,"""I think the younger players had fun having a go at him, as well, this week, which was fun to see."
9144,除了比赛，他还带给我们很多”。,"He provides a lot more than just play."""
9145,欧洲队长托马斯·比约恩 (Thomas Bjorn) 意识到大比分领先的局面即将被破,Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows big lead can soon disappear
9146,来自欧洲的队长托马斯·比约恩 (Thomas Bjorn) 根据经验判断，以大比分领先的优势进入莱德杯的单打决赛，很容易产生不利的局面。,"Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a sizeable lead heading into the last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride."
9147,戴恩于 1997 年瓦德拉玛 (Valderrama) 的比赛中首次亮相，当时，塞维·巴列斯特罗斯 (Seve Ballesteros) 担任队长的一方较美国队以五分优势领先，但最终只是 14½-13½ 以极其微弱优势的险胜。,"The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans but only just got over the finishing line with their noses in front by the narrowest of margins, winning 14½-13½."
9148,在观看了周五和昨天在法国国家高尔夫球场 (Le Golf National) 举行的 2018 届两场比赛（分别以 5-3 胜出，最终以 10-6 的比分领先）后，比约恩描述到，“你们要时刻提醒自己我们在瓦德拉玛 (Valderrama) 和布鲁克莱恩曾以大比分领先；虽然在布鲁克莱恩我们输了，但在瓦德拉玛 (Valderrama) 我们获得了险胜”。,"""You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only just,"" said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National."
9149,历史会告诉我和每一位队员，一切并未结束。,So history will show me and everybody on that team that this is not over.
9150,在明天到来之前你必须全力以赴。,You go full bore tomorrow.
9151,走出去，去做正确的事。,Get out there and do all the right things.
9152,一切并没有结束，直至分数登上积分榜。,This is not over till you've got the points on the board.
9153,我们的目标就是努力赢得奖杯，而这也是我们关注的重点。,"We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays."
9154,我一直在说，我关注的是我们队的 12 名球员，但我们非常清楚，我们即将面对的是什么 - 世界上最强大的球员”。,"I've said all along, I focus on the 12 players that are in our side, but we are so well aware of what's standing across on the other side - the greatest players in the world."""
9155,比约恩对球员们在高尔夫球场上的艰难对抗感到满意，他补充道：“在这方面，我永远都没办法战胜自己。,"Delighted how his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: ""I would never get ahead of myself in this."
9156,明天又是一场恶战。,Tomorrow's a different beast.
9157,明天是一场自告奋勇的个人表演，与平时有些不同。,"Tomorrow is the individual performances that come forward, and that is a different thing to do."
9158,如果比赛进展顺利，和搭档并肩作战将是件很棒的事情，但是如果孤军奋战，作为一名高尔夫球手，考验的将是你的整体能力。,"It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going good, but when you're out there individually, then you're tested to the full of your capacity as a golfer."
9159,这就是你需要让队员们明白的信息，明天充分发挥个人能力。,"That's the message that you need to get across to players, is get the best out of yourself tomorrow."
9160,现在，你必须离开你的搭档，而你的搭档也必须离开你，各自充分发挥自己的能力。”,"Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of himself, as well."""
9161,与比约恩不同，对方的吉姆·福瑞克 (Jim Furyk) 期待队员们的个人表现能够超越搭档表现，在四分中拿下三分的乔丹·斯皮思 (Jordan Spieth) 和贾斯汀‧托马斯 (Justin Thomas) 除外。,"In contrast to Bjorn, opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four."
9162,随着欧洲队努力实现“梅黛娜奇迹 (Miracle at Medinah)”以失败告终，作为布鲁克莱恩获胜队的一员，福瑞克已然站在决赛转折点的两端，胜败皆有可能。,"Furyk himself has been on both ends of those big last-day turnarounds, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up a loser as Europe pulled off the ""Miracle at Medinah."""
9163,在被问及本·克伦肖 (Ben Crenshaw) （1999 年的时任队长）如何为队员们鼓舞士气迎接决赛时，他回答道“我记得每一个该死的字眼”。,"""I remember every damn word of it,"" he said in reply to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had rallied his players heading into the last day."
9164,“明天我们有 12 场重要的比赛，但是你们可能想像在瓦德拉玛 (Valderrama) 和布鲁克莱恩一样先发制人。,"""We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to get off to that fast start like you saw at Brookline, like you saw at Medinah."
9165,如果大家都往同一个方向使劲，那么会给中场比赛带来很大压力。,"When that momentum gets going one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle matches."
9166,“所以我们的阵容进行了相应的调整，以对我们有利的方式出场，大家都知道，我们正在努力争取明天创造奇迹。”,"We set up our line-up accordingly and put the guys out in the fashion that we felt like, you know, we're trying to make some magic tomorrow."""
9167,托马斯负责带领球队反击，他将在决赛中对战罗里·麦克罗伊 (Rory McIlroy)，半决赛中依次对战保罗·凯西 (Paul Casey)、贾斯汀·罗斯 (Justin Rose)、乔恩·拉姆 (Jon Rahm)、汤米·弗利特伍德 (Tommy Fleetwood) 和伊恩·波尔特 (Ian Poulter) 等欧洲球员。,"Thomas has been handed the task of trying to lead the fightback and faces Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order."
9168,说到单打比赛，比约恩表示，“我以这样的顺序部署球员，是全方面考虑之后做出的决定”。,"""I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way through,"" said Bjorn of his singles selections."
9169,德国新战舰再次延期亮相,Germany's new warship postponed yet again
9170,据当地媒体报道，德国海军最新护卫舰本应于 2014 年进行调试，以替换冷战时期老旧的战舰，但是由于系统故障以及成本滚雪球式的增长，直至明年，我们都无法看到该护卫舰的亮相。,"German Navy's newest frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace ageing Cold War-era warships, but it won't be there until at least the next year due to faulty systems and snowballing cost, local media reported."
9171,据 Die Zeit 报纸报道，军方发言人表示，全新巴登-符腾堡级护卫舰的主舰 - “莱茵兰-普法尔茨号”的调试工作目前被推迟至 2019 年上半年。,"Commissioning of the ""Rheinland-Pfalz,"" the lead ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman."
9172,这艘护卫舰本应于 2014 年服役于海军，但令人头疼的生产后问题一致困扰着这项浩瀚工程的命运。,"The vessel should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the troubling post-delivery issues plagued the fate of the ambitious project."
9173,2007 年海军召回的四艘巴登-符腾堡级护卫舰将替代老旧的巴登-符腾堡级护卫舰。,The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels the Navy ordered back in 2007 will come as replacement to the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
9174,据了解，这艘护卫舰将拥有强大的火力、大批防空和反舰艇导弹以及一些隐形技术、如减少雷达、红外线和声学信号。,"It is understood they will feature a powerful cannon, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures."
9175,其他重要特征还包括维护周期较长 - 可以远离母港对最新护卫舰进行长达两年的部署。,Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
9176,然而，连续的延期意味着最先进的战舰 - 据说可以让德国在海外部署力量 - 在那投入使用之时，将已经过时。,"However, continuous delays mean that the cutting-edge warships - said to allow Germany to project power overseas - will already become outdated by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes."
9177,早在去年德国海军正式拒绝调试该护卫舰，并将其退还给汉堡的 Blohm &amp; Voss 船厂时，这艘命运多端的 F125 护卫舰便已成为新闻焦点。,"The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard in Hamburg."
9178,这是海军首次在交付后将船舰退还给造船厂。,This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
9179,关于此次退回的原因，外界知之甚少，但德国媒体援引了一些关键的“软件和硬件缺陷”，称这些缺陷将导致战舰在执行作战任务时毫无用处。,"Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of crucial ""software and hardware defects"" that made the warship useless if deployed on a combat mission."
9180,由于巴登-符腾堡级护卫舰将由 120 名船员操控，只需要老旧巴登-符腾堡级护卫舰一半的人力，因此软件缺陷将尤为致命。,Software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - just half of the manpower on older Bremen class frigates.
9181,同样，据透露，该护卫舰严重超重，这将降低其性能并限制海军添加未来升级的能力。,"Also, it emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades."
9182,"据称，这艘 7,000 吨重的“莱茵兰-普法尔茨号”的重量是德国二战时期所用的同等级护卫舰的二倍。","The 7,000-ton ""Rheinland-Pfalz"" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by the Germans in the Second World War."
9183,除硬件故障以外，整个项目的耗资 - 包括船员的培训 - 也成为一个令人头疼的问题。,"Aside from faulty hardware, the price tag of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is also becoming an issue."
9184,据说耗资已经惊人地达到了 31 亿欧元（36 亿美元），而最初预算仅为 22 亿欧元。,It is said to have reached staggering €3.1billion ($3.6bn) - up from initial €2.2 billion.
9185,鉴于近期关于德国海军力量正在缩水的警告，最新护卫舰所临的问题变得更为严重。,Problems gripping the newest frigates become especially of importance in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
9186,今年年初，德国议会国防委员会主席汉斯-皮特·巴特尔斯 (Hans-Peter Bartels) 承认，德国海军实际上“已经没有可以部署的舰船了”。,"Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged the Navy is actually ""running out of deployment-capable ships."""
9187,这位官员表示，随着时间的推移，这一问题越来越严重，老旧的舰船逐渐退役，却没有可替代的新船舰。,"The official said the issue has snowballed over time, because old ships were decommissioned but no replacement vessels were provided."
9188,他哀叹竟没有一艘巴登-符腾堡级护卫舰能够服役于海军。,He lamented that none of the of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
9189,国民信托窃听蝙蝠的秘密生活,National Trust eavesdrops on secret life of bats
9190,苏格兰高地的一处庄园正在进行一项新的研究，该研究旨在揭示蝙蝠如何利用这片土地进行觅食。,New research being carried out at an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food.
9191,研究希望这一发现能够揭开这种独特的飞行类哺乳动物的行为面纱，并有助于指导未来的保护活动。,It is hoped the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
9192,苏格兰国民信托 (National Trust for Scotland) 的科学家们进行的这项研究，将在 Wester Ross 的因弗鲁花园 (Inverewe Gardens) 追踪常见的伏翼和高音伏翼以及棕色的长耳蝙蝠和 Daubenton 蝙蝠。,The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
9193,他们将在花园周围的一些关键位置安装特殊录音机，追踪蝙蝠一年四季的活动。,Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
9194,NHS 工作人员和志愿者们将利用手持探测器进行流动调查。,NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
9195,然后对所有录音进行专业声音分析，以确定蝙蝠叫声的频率以及哪种蝙蝠在进行什么活动。,Expert sound analysis of all recordings will ascertain the frequency of the bat calls and which species are doing what.
9196,然后制作出栖息地地图和报告，以针对蝙蝠的行为生成详细的实景图片。,A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour.
9197,NHS 的自然保护顾问罗布·杜瓦 (Rob Dewar) 希望研究结果能够揭示哪块栖息地对蝙蝠来说至关重要，以及每种蝙蝠如何利用这些栖息地。,"Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species."
9198,这些信息将帮助判断栖息地管理工作的利益，例如，草地铺设以及如何最有效地维护蝙蝠以及其他相关物种生存的林地。,This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as meadow creation and how best to maintain woodlands for bats and other associated species.
9199,但是过去一个世纪以来，苏格兰和英国地区的蝙蝠数量出现大幅下降。,Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the past century.
9200,建筑和开发工作对蝙蝠造成了巨大威胁，影响了它们的栖息处甚至导致它们失去栖息地。,They are under threat from building and development work that affects roosts and loss of habitat.
9201,风力涡轮机和照明、捕蝇纸和一些建筑材料的化学处理，以及宠物猫的攻击都对蝙蝠造成了风险。,"Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypapers and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats."
9202,蝙蝠实际上是可以看见的。,Bats are not actually blind.
9203,然而，由于夜间狩猎习惯，在扑捉猎物时它们的耳朵比眼睛更为有用。,"However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey."
9204,它们能够利用复杂的回声定位技术准确定位飞行路径中的小虫和障碍物。,They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to pinpoint bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
9205,"负责维护苏格兰 270 多幢历史建筑、38 间重要花园和 76,000 公顷土地的 NTS 对待蝙蝠的问题非常严肃。","The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously."
9206,NTS 有十位身经百战的专家，他们定期进行调查、栖息处检测，有时也进行救援。,"It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, roost inspections and sometimes rescues."
9207,该组织甚至在位于丹弗里斯-加洛韦 (Dumfries and Galloway) 的 Threave 庄园建立了苏格兰第一个也是唯一一个专门的蝙蝠保护区，该保护区是苏格兰 8 种蝙蝠（共 10 种）的家园。,"The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species."
9208,庄园管理者戴维·汤普森 (David Thompson) 表示该庄园是蝙蝠们理想的沃土。,Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for them.
9209,“在 Threave 庄园，我们专为蝙蝠打造了一片区域”，汤普森表示。,"""Here at Threave we have a great area for bats,"" he said."
9210,“这里有老旧的建筑、成片的老树和所有绝佳的栖息地。,"""We've got the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and all the good habitat."
9211,但是，关于蝙蝠还有很多未知的知识，所以我们在这里以及其他庄园所做的工作将帮助我们更多地了解蝙蝠如何才能茁壮成长。,"But there is much about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."""
9212,汤普森强调，一定要在进行庄园维护之前检查蝙蝠的情况，因为如果在不知情的情况下破坏一个雌性蝙蝠栖息处，就可能导致多达 400 只雌性蝙蝠和蝙蝠幼崽死亡，进而导致当地种群完全灭绝。,"He stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance within properties as it is possible unwitting destruction of a single maternity roost could kill up to 400 females and young, possibly wiping out an entire local population."
9213,蝙蝠是受保护的，捕杀、攻击、骚扰蝙蝠或破坏其栖息地都是违法行为。,"Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their roosts."
9214,蝙蝠保护基金会 (Bat Conservation Trust) 的苏格兰官员伊丽莎白·费雷尔 (Elisabeth Ferrell) 鼓励公众贡献自己的力量。,"Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to pitch in to help."
9215,她表示：“对于蝙蝠以及我们不清楚其种群具体情况的许多其他物种而言，我们还有很多知识需要了解。”,"She said: ""We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don't know how their populations are faring."""
9216,罗纳尔多否认强奸指控，律师准备起诉德国杂志,Ronaldo dismisses rape claims as lawyers set to sue German magazine
9217,克里斯蒂亚诺·罗纳尔多 (Cristiano Ronaldo) 被“虚假新闻”冠以遭遇强奸指控的恶名，他表示人们想利用他来“炒作自己”。,"Cristiano Ronaldo has branded rape claims against him as ""fake news,"" saying that people ""want to promote themselves"" by using his name."
9218,他的律师准备起诉曾发表指控的德国新闻杂志《明镜周刊》。,"His lawyers are set to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations."
9219,这位葡萄牙和尤文图斯队的前锋被指控于拉斯维加斯某酒店的 2009 房间强奸美籍女子凯瑟琳·马约尔加 (Kathryn Mayorga)。,"The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, named as Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009."
9220,"据《明镜周刊》周五报道，罗纳尔多被指称事后向这名女子偿付了 375,000 美元，让她对此次事件三缄其口。","He is alleged to have then paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday."
9221,指控被曝光的数小时后，33 岁的罗纳尔多在 Instagram 上向 1.42 亿关注者发布了一段直播视频，指责这些报道为“虚假新闻”。,"Speaking in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, slammed the reports as ""fake news."""
9222,“不，不，不，不，不，,"""No, no, no, no , no."
9223,他们今天所说的都是虚假新闻”，这位五次金球奖得主面对镜头说到。,"What they said today, fake news,"" the five-time Ballon d'Or winner says into the camera."
9224,“他们不过是想利用我的名字炒作自己。,"""They want to promote themselves by using my name."
9225,这很正常。,It's normal.
9226,他们想利用我出名，但这也是他们工作的一部分。,"They want to be famous to say my name, but it is part of the job."
9227,我是个幸福的人，各方面都很好”，罗纳尔多笑着补充到。,"I am a happy man and all good,"" the player added, smiling."
9228,据路透社报道，罗纳尔多的律师准备就此次指控起诉《明镜周刊》，称其“未经许可的报道涉嫌侵犯个人隐私”。,"Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called ""an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy,"" according to Reuters."
9229,律师克里斯蒂安·谢尔兹 (Christian Schertz ) 表示罗纳尔多将要求赔偿“与侵犯行为的严重程度相应的精神损害赔偿金额，这可能是近年来最严重的侵犯人权案例”。,"Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for ""moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."""
9230,据称，指称事件发生在 2009 年 6 月，拉斯维加斯棕榈树赌场度假酒店 (Palms Hotel and Casino) 的一间套房内。,The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
9231,据内华达州克拉克县地方法院的文件显示，罗纳尔多和马约尔加在一家夜店见面后，报道称二人回到了球员的房间，在那里发生了强奸事件。,"After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly anally raped her, according to papers filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada."
9232,马约尔加称，罗纳尔多在指称事件发生后下跪对她说，自己“99%”的时候都是“绅士”，而如今却被那“1%”拖下水。,"Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was ""99 percent"" a ""good guy"" let down by the ""one percent."""
9233,文件指出罗纳尔多承认二人发生性关系，但是双方自愿的。,"The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the pair had sex, but that it was consensual."
9234,马约尔加还表示，她去了警察局，在医院拍下了自己受伤的照片，但后来却同意了庭外和解，因为她“害怕遭到报复”，担心“受到公开羞辱”。,"Mayorga also claims she went to the police and had photographs taken of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt ""terrified of retaliation"" and was worried about ""being publicly humiliated."""
9235,34 岁的马约尔加称，由于因指称事件影响持续受到精神创伤，因此目前她正寻求推翻庭外和解。,The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to overturn the settlement as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
9236,指称案件发生时，罗纳尔多即将从曼联加盟皇马，而今年夏天罗纳尔多已经以 1 亿欧元入会费加入意大利豪门尤文图斯。,"Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer moved to Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal."
9237,脱欧：英国失去汽车制造商“成为其永远的遗憾”,Brexit: UK 'would forever regret' losing carmakers
9238,英国商务大臣格雷格·克拉克 (Greg Clark) 表示，英国脱欧后，失去其汽车制造业全球领导者的地位，将“成为其永远的遗憾”。,"The UK ""would regret it forever"" if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said."
9239,他补充道，英国丰田工厂向 BBC 介绍称，如果英国在没有达成协议的情况下退出欧盟，则丰田将暂时停止德比附近的伯纳斯顿工厂的生产。,"He added it was ""concerning"" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby."
9240,“我们需要一份协议”，克拉克先生说道。,"""We need a deal,"" Mr Clark said."
9241,这家日本汽车制造商表示，英国在没有达成一致的情况下脱欧，边境延误问题可能会导致就业机会减少。,The Japanese carmaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
9242,伯纳斯顿工厂负责制造丰田的 Auris 和 Avensis，去年生产了近 15 万辆汽车，其中 90％ 出口到了其他欧盟国家。,"The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union."
9243,“我的观点是，如果英国在 3 月底退出欧盟，我们的工厂将停止生产”，丰田公司伯纳斯顿工厂董事总经理马文·库克 (Marvin Cooke) 介绍道。,"""My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March we will see production stops in our factory,"" said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston."
9244,其他英国汽车制造商，包括本田、宝马和捷豹路虎同样表示，如果在英国脱欧后跨境贸易运作的问题上未达成协议的情况下，担心会出什么问题。,"Other UK car manufacturers have raised fears about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover."
9245,例如，宝马表示，将在英国脱欧后，将位于牛津的迷你工厂关闭一个月。,"BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit."
9246,汽车制造商主要的担心是未达成协议的情况下脱欧，可能存在供应链风险。,The main concerns relate to what carmakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
9247,丰田生产线的运行基础为“准时制”，每 37 分钟便会收到从英国和欧盟的供应商下达的汽车订单。,"Toyota's production line is run on a ""just-in-time"" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order."
9248,如果在 3 月 29 日，英国在没有达成协议的情况下便退出欧盟，那么英国的边境可能会出现中断问题，业内人士称，这可能会导致部件延迟和短缺。,"If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts."
9249,该公司表示，德比郡的丰田工厂无法持有超过一天的库存，因此生产将停止。,"It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be stopped."
9250,克拉克先生表示，特雷莎·梅 (Theresa May) 针对未来与欧盟的关系所提出的契克斯计划 (Chequers plan) “经过准确核对，能避免边境检查”。,"Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is ""precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."""
9251,“我们需要达成协议。我们希望达成最圆满的协议，既能实现目前的成功，也能让我们抓住这个机会“，他向 BBC 广播电台的《4's Today》节目这样介绍道。,"""We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow as I say not just the success at present to be enjoyed but for us to grasp this opportunity,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme."
9252,“丰田和其他制造商的证据表明，我们需要绝对的能力，继续推动一系列成效显著的供应链。”,"""The evidence from not just Toyota but other manufacturers is that we need to absolutely be able to continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."""
9253,丰田未表示会停产多久，但从长远来看，成本的增长将削弱工厂的竞争力并最终影响工作机会。,"Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term, warned that added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs."
9254,Peter Bouvallaris 已在伯纳斯顿工厂工作了 24 年，现任是工厂的联合召集人，他表示，他的成员越来越担心：“根据我的经验来看，一旦丢了这些工作，就再也回不来了。,"Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union convenor at the plant, said his members are increasingly concerned: ""In my experience once these jobs go they never come back."
9255,一位政府发言人介绍称：“对于未来与欧盟的关系，我们已经制定了精确可靠的计划。”,"A government spokesperson said: ""We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."""
9256,白宫称，特朗普与罗森斯坦的会面可能会再次推迟,"Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House"
9257,白宫周日表示，由于最高法院候选人布雷特卡瓦诺的风波尚未平息，唐纳德·特朗普与司法部副部长罗德·罗森斯坦 (Rod Rosenstein) 的高端会议可能会“推迟一周”。,"Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be ""pushed back another week"" as the fight over supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday."
9258,罗森斯坦负责监督特别顾问罗伯特·穆勒 (Robert Mueller) 的工作，而罗伯特·穆勒特朗普竞选团队被控私通俄罗斯案以及总统可能妨碍司法公正的调查。,"Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, links between Trump aides and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president."
9259,特朗普是否会解雇司法部副部长，从而危及穆勒的独立，几个月以来，华盛顿对此议论纷纷。,"Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thereby endanger Mueller's independence, has fuelled Washington gossip for months."
9260,本月初，《纽约时报》报道称，罗森斯坦曾讨论，佩戴窃听器记录与特朗普的谈话，以及是否有可能通过第 25 次修正案罢免这位总统。,"Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment."
9261,罗森斯坦对这一报道予以否认。,Rosenstein denied the report.
9262,但上周一，在铺天盖地的称其即将辞职的报道中，他前往了白宫。,"But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports he was about to resign."
9263,周四，有消息宣布称他与当时在纽约联合国的特朗普进行了会面。,"Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday."
9264,特朗普表示，他“不愿意”解雇罗森斯坦，但随后推迟了会议，这是为了避免与参议院司法委员会的听证会发生冲突，卡瓦诺和一名指控其性行为不端的女性克里斯蒂娜·布拉西·福特博士将出席听证会发表证词。,"Trump said he would ""prefer not"" to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate judiciary committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified."
9265,周五，特朗普下令联邦调查局对卡瓦诺进行为期一周的调查，又将参议院的全面投票延后。,"On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote."
9266,特朗普的新闻秘书萨拉·桑德斯 (Sarah Sanders) 周日现身 Fox News。,"Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday."
9267,当被问及罗森斯坦会面的问题时，她说道：“鉴于最高法院正在进行的所有其他事情，可能会推迟一周，具体日期还没有确定，我想，可能是本周。”,"Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: ""A date for that hasn't been set, it could be this week, I could see that pushing back another week given all of the other things that are going on with the supreme court."
9268,但是我们会看到这一天的，我会随时告知媒体相关进展。”,"But we'll see and I always like to keep the press updated."""
9269,一些记者会对这种说法进行反驳：桑德斯自 9 月 10 日以来，一直没有在举行过白宫新闻发布会。,Some reporters would contest that assertion: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since 10 September.
9270,主持人克里斯·华莱士 (Chris Wallace) 问这是为什么。,Host Chris Wallace asked why.
9271,桑德斯说，没举行新闻发布会并不是因为讨厌电视记者的“哗众取宠”，尽管她说道：“我不会反对他们哗众取宠的报道。”,"Sanders said the scarcity of briefings was not due to a distaste for TV reporters ""grandstanding,"" although she said: ""I won't disagree with the fact that they grandstand."""
9272,她随后表示，将会增加特朗普与媒体之间的直接接触。,She then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
9273,她说：“特朗普总统的问答环节比以往任何一位总统都多。”不过，她并未援引任何证据。“我们研究过这些数字。”,"""The president does more Q&amp;A sessions than any president has prior to him,"" she said, adding without citing evidence: ""We've looked at those numbers."""
9274,桑德斯说，仍会举行新闻发布会，但“如果媒体有机会直接向美国总统提问，那要比跟我交谈好得多。”,"Briefings will still happen, Sanders said, but ""if the press has the chance to ask the president of the United States questions directly, that's infinitely better than talking to me."
9275,我们尽量多组织这样的问答，过去几周也确实组织了好多次，当大家可以直接与美国总统对话后，便会取消新闻发布会。,"We try to do that a lot and you've seen us do that a lot over the last few weeks and that's going to take the place of a press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States."""
9276,特朗普在离开白宫或参加与来访政要的公开会议或新闻发布会时，经常会设置问答环节。,Trump regularly takes questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
9277,单独进行的新闻发布会很少。,Solo press conferences are rare.
9278,本周在纽约，总统或许向我们说明了这背后的原因，毫无顾忌地出现在聚集的记者面前，有时甚至表现得很奇怪。,"In New York this week the president perhaps demonstrated why, making a freewheeling and at times bizarre appearance before gathered reporters."
9279,卫生部长就英国脱欧的担忧致信苏格兰国家医疗服务体系 (NHS) 的欧盟工作人员,Health secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland over Brexit fears
9280,卫生部长致信苏格兰国家医疗服务体系 (NHS) 的欧盟工作人员，表达国家对他们的感激之情，并希望他们在英国脱欧后继续留在苏格兰。,The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish for them to stay on post-Brexit.
9281,医疗服务计划 (MSP) 的珍妮·弗里曼 (Jeane Freeman) 曾在英国退出欧盟前六个月内发出一份信函。,Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months to go until the UK withdraws from the EU.
9282,苏格兰政府已经承诺为在其移交的公共服务部门工作的欧盟公民支付定居身份申请的费用。,The Scottish Government has already committed to meet the cost of settled status applications for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
9283,在信中，弗里曼写道：“英国和欧盟之间关于脱欧的谈判一直持续了整个夏天，有望在今年秋天做出决定。,"In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: ""Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and EU on withdrawal have continued, heading towards expected decisions this autumn."
9284,但是英国政府也在加紧为可能出现的无协议局面做准备。,But the UK Government has also been stepping up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
9285,我知道这段时间对你们来说一定感觉非常不安。,I know this must be a very unsettling time for all of you.
9286,因此，我想重申我是多么重视每一名工作人员的贡献，无论你们的国籍如何。,"That is why I wanted to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality."
9287,欧盟内外的同事们提供的宝贵经验和技能，将加强和改进我们的医疗服务工作，造福我们所服务的患者和社区。,"Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve."
9288,苏格兰永远是你们的家，我们非常希望你们能留在这里。”,"Scotland is absolutely your home and we very much want you to stay here."""

9297,在周六的比赛中，退出比赛前，他共完成 5 次铲球，从而将其赛季铲球总数提高到了 18 次。,"He had five total tackles Saturday before exiting the game, which brought his season total to 18 tackles."

9304,此举还承诺提供更多经济适用房，锁定高收入人群。这一举动还被视为是为了抵消杰里米·科尔宾 (Jeremy Corbyn) 在吸引年轻选民方面所取得的成功。,The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's drive to attract young voters with pledges to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
9305,加收印花税针对的是在英国不纳税的个人和公司，额外取得的资金将用于改善政府对露宿问题的解决。,"The stamp duty rise will be levied on individuals and firms not paying tax in the UK, with the extra money boosting the Government's drive to combat rough sleeping."
9306,除了目前的印花税，包括两年前推出的第二套住房与买房租赁增税，附加费可能高达 3％。,"The surcharge - which is in addition to the present stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-lets - could be as much as three per cent."
9307,财政部预计，每年将筹资1.2 亿英镑。,The Treasury expects the move to raise up to £120 million a year.
9308,据估计，13％ 的新建伦敦房产的购买者为非英国居民，这抬高了价格，使首次购房者的买房之路难上加难。,"An estimated 13 per cent of new-build London properties are bought by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing ladder."
9309,英国许多富裕地区，尤其是伦敦，已经成了“鬼城”，因为大量外国购房者大部分时间都不在英国。,"Many wealthy areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become ""ghost towns"" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country."
9310,就在这项新政策推出前，鲍里斯·约翰逊 (Boris Johnson) 呼吁减少印花税，让更多年轻人能购买第一套房产。,The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty cut to help more young people own their first home.
9311,他指责大型建筑公司通过抢购土地，而不是使用土地，来维持房价的高水平，并力劝梅女士放弃对经济适用房的配额，解决英国的“住房耻辱”。,"He accused big construction firms of keeping property prices high by snapping up land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to abandon quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain's ""housing disgrace."""
9312,科尔宾先生宣布了一系列住房改革建议，博得了众多眼球，包括租金管制和结束“无过错”的搬迁。,"Mr Corbyn has announced an eye-catching series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to ""no-fault"" evictions."
9313,他还希望，赋予议会更大的权力来建造新的房屋。,He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
9314,梅女士称：“去年我说过，我会在任职首相期间，恢复英国人的梦想，让每个新生代的生活都变得更好。,"Mrs May said: ""Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for each new generation."
9315,这意味着，要修复支离破碎的住房市场。,And that means fixing our broken housing market.
9316,英国将永远欢迎那些想在这里生活、工作和建立家庭的人。,"Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here."
9317,然而，对于不住在英国的个人以及外国公司来说，与勤劳的英国居民在购房难度上别无二致，这是不对的。,"However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign-based companies, to buy homes as hard-working British residents."
9318,对于太多人来说，拥有房屋的梦想太遥不可及，露宿的侮辱仍然非常真实。“,"For too many people the dream of home ownership has become all too distant, and the indignity of rough sleeping remains all too real."""
9319,Jack Ross：“我最终的理想是成为苏格兰教练”,Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'

9328,这位前阿罗体育队 (Alloa Athletic) 的老板说道，在这么大的俱乐部，前有这么多知名的人物，自己并不觉得害怕，之前他曾拒绝了巴恩斯利队 (Barnsley) 和奇城队 (Ipswich Town) 的邀请。,"The former Alloa Athletic boss says he felt no trepidation in following such established names at such a big club, having previously rejected overtures from Barnsley and Ipswich Town."
9329,“我现在的成功与否取决于‘我能否带领球队重返英超？’,"""Success for me at the moment will be gauged by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'"
9330,由于这支球队的结构和设施，肯定能打入英超”，他说道。,"Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League,"" he said."
9331,“这个任务并不容易，但我只有带领球队重返英超，我才可能会觉得自己算得上成功了。”,"""It is not an easy task to get it there, but I would probably only view myself as being successful here if I can get the club back there."""
9332,算起来，他的主教生涯才刚刚开始三年。罗斯在登巴顿当过一段时间的助理教练，并在红心队的教练组工作过 15个月。,"Ross is only three years into his management career, after a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell on Hearts' coaching staff."
9333,之后，他带领阿罗从降级走到了第三梯队，在接下来的赛季，又带领圣米伦队从降级的边缘转变为总冠军。,"He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier, and transformed St Mirren from the brink of relegation to Championship title winners the following season."
9334,罗斯说，比起之前在克莱德 (Clyde)、哈特尔普尔 (Hartlepool)、福尔柯克 (Falkirk)、圣米伦队和汉密尔顿学院 (Hamilton Academical) 球队的职业生涯，现在感觉更加舒服。,"And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical."
9335,回忆起在阿罗队的经历，他说道：“这可能是一个真正的十字路口。,"""It was probably a real crossroads,"" he recalled, of taking charge of Alloa."
9336,我真心觉得，我更适合做教练，比踢球更适合我。,"""I genuinely did believe management was the right fit for me, more so than playing."
9337,这听起来很奇怪，因为我表现得还不错，靠这个生活也没什么问题，也确实有很多乐趣。,"It sounds bizarre because I did okay, made a reasonable living out of it, and enjoyed some reasonable highs."
9338,但是踢球有时会很艰难。,But playing can be tough.
9339,每周都有很多事情要做。,There are a lot of things you have to get through on a weekly basis.
9340,我还是会感到踢球的压力，但做教练的我，感觉不错。,I still go through that in terms of the stresses and pressure of the job but management just feels right.
9341,“我一直想做一名教练，现在我做到了，这是我成年以来，感觉最舒服的日子。”,"I always wanted to manage and now I am doing it, it feels the most comfortable I have been in my own skin throughout my entire adult life."""

9351,整个酒吧行业本月的酒水销售额增长了 6.6％，食品销售额下降了 3％。”,"Across managed pubs and bars drink sales were up 6.6 per cent for the month, with food down three per cent."""

9353,影响外出消费市场销售额的主要因素中，最大的因素当属天气以及重要社会活动或体育赛事。,Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
9354,餐饮业的持续苦苦挣扎，不足为奇，相比于销售额同比下降 4.8％，更为头疼的是持续加剧的成本压力。,"It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, albeit a sales drop of 4.8 per cent year-on-year will be particularly painful on top of ongoing cost pressures."
9355,对于以用餐为主的运营商而言，漫长炎热的夏天的影响可谓晴天霹雳，时间会告诉我们，8 月份气温适中的天气，能否带来必要的喘息时间。,"The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we've experienced in August will provide some much-needed respite."""

9382,一家吸奶器公司发布的广告中，将正在哺乳的妈妈比作成挤奶的奶牛，这条广告引发了网友的分歧。,A breast pump company has divided opinion online with an advert that compares nursing mothers to cows being milked.
9383,在推出新产品“世界上第一款无声可穿戴式吸乳器”时，消费者科技公司 Elvie 发布了一条诙谐的音乐视频灵感广告，广告中展示了这种新型吸奶器给母亲带来的自由。,"To mark the launch of what is said to be the ""world's first silent wearable breast bump,"" consumer tech company Elvie released a tongue-in-cheek music video-inspired advert to showcase the freedom the new pump gives to expressing mothers."
9384,四位真实的母亲在堆满干草的奶牛棚中，跟着音乐翩翩起舞，音乐中有一部分歌词如下：“对，我亲自喂养，但你看不到尾巴”，“是不是没发现我的大奶，其实是我的乳房。”,"Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn of cows to a track that includes lyrics like: ""Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see no tail"" and ""In case you hadn't noticed these are not udders, they're my boobs."""
9385,接下来的歌词是：“抽出来，抽出来，喂我的小宝宝，抽出来，抽出来，奶奶我的小公主。”,"The chorus continues: ""Pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding them babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'm milking my ladies."""
9386,但是这条广告在该公司的 Facebook 页面上发布后，在网上引起了争议。,"However, the advert, which has been published on the firm's Facebook page, has caused controversy online."
9387,"这条视频的观看次数为 77,000，共有数百条评论，观众的反应各异，许多人觉得，这有蔑视乳制品行业“恐怖”的嫌疑。","With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it makes light of the ""horrors"" of the dairy industry."
9388,“用奶牛做这个产品的广告宣传，这个决定太失误了。,"""Very poor decision using cows to advertise this product."
9389,奶牛跟我们一样，需要怀孕分娩才能有奶，但不同之处在于，奶牛的婴儿在分娩后几天就会被人偷走”，一位网友写道。,"Like us they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except their babies are stolen from them within days of giving birth,"" one wrote."
9390,Elvie 吸乳器正好可以放在哺乳文胸 (Elvie/Mother) 内,The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly inside a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)
9391,另一位网友评论道：“对于母亲和婴儿来说，这无疑是一种创伤。,"Another commented: ""Understandably traumatic for both mother and baby."
9392,为什么要在吸奶器广告中，将妈妈比做城市奶牛呢，妈妈可不希望孩子离开自己？”,"But yeah why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who get to keep their babies?"""
9393,另有网友补充说：“这广告太不符合现实了。”,"Someone else added: ""Such an out of touch advert."""
9394,其他人则认为广告不错，一位女士承认，她发现这首歌“很搞笑”。,"Others defended the advert, with one woman admitting that she found the song ""hilarious."""
9395,“我觉得这个创意特别新颖。,"""I think this is a genus idea."
9396,如果我还在哺乳的话，我会买一个的。,I would've had one if I was still breastfeeding.
9397,吸奶的过程，让我觉得自己就是一头奶牛。,Pumping made me feel exactly like a cow.
9398,广告是有一些过头，但我觉得还好。,The advert is a little mad but I took it for what it was.
9399,这个产品很新颖。”一位网友这样写道。,"This is a genius product,"" one wrote."
9400,另一位网友评论道：这条滑稽的广告针对的就是需要吸奶（通常是在公司或卫生间内）感觉自己像“奶牛”一样的妈妈。,"Another commented: ""This is a fun advert aimed at mums who pump (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like ""cows."""
9401,并不无意要赞扬或是评判乳制品行业。”,"This is not an advert praising or judging the dairy industry."""
9402,在视频结尾时，这群妈妈展示了自己在跳舞时，其实文胸中还穿戴了吸奶器。,At the end of the video the group of women reveal they've all been dancing with the discreet pumps tucked in their bras.
9403,这条宣传广告后的创意，来源于许多女性在吸奶的时候称自己就像是奶牛。,The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who breast-pump say they feel like cows.
9404,然而，Elvie 吸奶器完全静音，无需电线或管子，可以完美地放置于哺乳文胸内，让女性解放双手，可以抱着婴儿，甚至可以在外出时继续吸奶。,"The Elvie Pump however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while pumping."
9405,Mother 的合伙人兼执行创意总监 (ECD) Ana Balarin 评论道：“Elvie Pump 是一款革命性的产品，值得大胆尝试。,"Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: ""The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch."
9406,通过对比哺乳妈妈和奶牛，我们希望将吸奶的过程及其问题置于聚光灯下，同时以一种有趣又有关联的方式，展示这种新型吸奶器能给人带来无与伦比的自由感。,"By drawing a parallel between expressing women and dairy cows we wanted to put breast pumping and all its challenges in the spotlight, while demonstrating in an entertaining and relatable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring."
9407,这已经不是 Elvie 吸奶器首次上头条新闻。,This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made the headlines.

9409,数百名流动儿童悄悄转移至德克萨斯州边境的一处露营地,Hundreds of Migrant Children Quietly Moved to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border
9410,尽管每个月边境口岸的政策相对不会发生变化，但被扣留的流动儿童数量仍大幅上升，部分应归因于特朗普政府推行严厉的说辞和政策，增加了赞助者们安置儿童的难度。,"The number of detained migrant children has spiked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with sponsors."
9411,传说大多数赞助者本身都是非法移民，他们担心站出来领养儿童会危及自身留在美国的可能性。,"Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and have feared jeopardizing their own ability to remain in the country by stepping forward to claim a child."
9412,六月，联邦当局宣布潜在赞助者及其其他成年家庭成员必须提交指纹，并且当局将与移民局共享其指纹信息，这导致风险大大上升。,"The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities."
9413,上周，移民和海关执法局 (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) 的高级官员马修·阿尔伯塞特 (Matthew Albence) 在国会前证实，该机构已经逮捕数十名申请赞助无成人陪伴儿童的人员。,"Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors."
9414,稍后，该机构证实称 70% 被逮捕的人均无犯罪前科。,The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
9415,“近 80% 作为赞助者或赞助者家庭成员的个人均为非法入境，其中大部分为跨国罪犯。,"""Close to 80 percent of the individuals that are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are here in the country illegally, and a large chunk of those are criminal aliens."
9416,因此我们在不停地追捕这些人”，阿尔伯塞特说到。,"So we are continuing to pursue those individuals,"" Mr. Albence said."
9417,据庇护所工作人员称，为了尽快解决这些儿童的问题，官员们推出了新的规定，要求其中一些孩子在被扣留的一个月（而不是之前规定的 60 天后）内出庭。,"Seeking to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers."
9418,很多儿童不会亲自出庭，相反，将以视频电话会议的形式出现，向移民法官就自己的合法身份进行辩护。,"Many will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status to an immigration judge."
9419,那些被认为不符合救济资格的儿童将被迅速驱逐出境。,Those who are deemed ineligible for relief will be swiftly deported.
9420,据庇护所工作人员以及近几个月该系统的报告称，儿童被扣留的时间越长，他们就越有可能变得焦虑或抑郁，从而导致产生暴力行为或逃跑企图。,"The longer that children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months."
9421,辩护律师表示，在像 Tornillo 这样的大型设施中，这方面的担忧更为严重，因为这样的地方规模过于庞大，很容易忽视儿童反抗的迹象。,"Advocates said those concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be overlooked, because of its size."
9422,他们补充说，在儿童没有足够的时间在情感上做好准备，也没有足够的时间和朋友们道别的情况下，将儿童转移到帐篷城，可能会加重很多儿童本就已经遭受的创伤。,They added that moving children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could compound trauma that many are already struggling with.

9426,“他们必须立即无条件撤离”，穆阿利姆向联合国大会表示。,"""They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions,"" he told the assembly."
9427,"穆阿利姆坚持称叙利亚的“反恐战争即将结束”，自 2011 年以来战争已经导致 360,000 多人死亡，数百万人流离失所。","Moualem insisted that the ""war on terror is almost over"" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more uprooted from their homes."
9428,他表示，大马士革方面将继续“对抗这场祭祀之战，直到我们清除叙利亚领土”上的所有恐怖组织和“所有非法外国势力。”,"He said Damascus would continue ""fighting this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories"" of both terror groups and ""any illegal foreign presence."""
9429,"美国有 2,000 多名士兵驻扎在叙利亚，主要负责为反对总统巴沙尔·阿萨德 (Bashar al-Assad) 的库尔德部队和叙利亚阿拉伯人提供培训和咨询。","The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad."
9430,"法国有 1,000 多名士兵驻扎在这个战乱的国家。","France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-wracked country."
9431,对于难民问题，穆阿利姆表示条件允许他们回国，并谴责“某些西方国家”“传播非理性恐惧”迫使他们背井离乡。,"On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were fine for them to return, and he blamed ""some western countries"" for ""spreading irrational fears"" that prompted refugees to stay away."
9432,“我们已经呼吁国际社会和人道主义组织帮助促成难民回国”，他表示。,"""We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,"" he said."
9433,“他们正在将纯粹的人道主义问题政治化”。,"""They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."""
9434,美国和欧盟已经警告称，不会为叙利亚提供重建援助，直至阿萨德与反对派达成终止战争的政治协议。,The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
9435,联合国 (UN) 外交官表示，俄罗斯和土耳其近期就在伊德利卜最后一个主要叛军据点建立缓冲区达成协议，此举为推进政治谈判创造了机会。,UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to press ahead with political talks.
9436,俄罗斯和土耳其之间的协议避免了俄罗斯支持的叙利亚军队对居住有三百万人口的省发起大规模进攻。,"The Russian-Turkish deal averted a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live."
9437,然而，穆阿利姆强调，这项协议有“明确的最后期限”，并表示希望军事行动将目标指向圣战者，包括“将被根除”的与基地组织有关的努斯拉阵线的武装分子。,"Moualem however stressed that the agreement had ""clear deadlines"" and expressed hope that military action will target jihadists including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who ""will be eradicated."""
9438,联合国特使德米苏图拉 (Staffan de Mistura) 希望由政府和反对派成员组成的新委员会尽快召开首次会议，起草叙利亚战后宪法，为选举铺平道路。,UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is hoping to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee comprised of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way to elections.
9439,穆阿利姆列出了叙利亚政府加入委员会的条件，他表示，委员会的工作应该限制为“审查现行宪法的条款”，并警告不要加以干涉。,"Moualem laid out conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be restricted ""to reviewing the articles of the current constitution,"" and warned against interference."
9440,特朗普为什么会赢得连任,Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
9441,按照这种逻辑，特朗普将在 2020 年赢得连任，除非如众多自由观众所愿，弹劾和丑闻提前终止他的总统任期。,"By that logic, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers are probably hoping, impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely."
9442,毫无疑问的是，“这将成为有史以来最具戏剧性的总统任期结局！”,"In what would no doubt be ""The most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!"""
9443,但是到目前为止，人们似乎还没有出现审美疲劳的迹象。,"As of now, there are no signs of viewer fatigue."
9444,自 2014 年以来，美国有线电视新闻网 (CNN) 黄金时段的收视率增长了不止一倍多，达到了 105 万，而微软全国广播电视公司 (MSNBC) 的收视率则增至三倍，达到了 160 万。,"Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC."
9445,尼尔森 (Nielsen) 的数据显示，福克斯新闻 (Fox News) 黄金时段的平均观众人数从四年前的 170 万上升至 240 万，而 MSNBC 的《雷切尔·玛多秀》(The Rachel Maddow Show) 凭借主要夜间新闻高达 350 万的观众人数稳居有线电视收视率榜首。,"Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" has topped cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights."
9446,对于在一场摧毁美国国会大厦的袭击后成为总统的这位内阁大臣，美国广播公司 (ABC) 电视剧《指定幸存者》(Designated Survivor) 的制作人尼尔·贝尔 (Neal Baer) 表示，“因为我们不理解，所以人们像飞蛾扑火般被吸引”。,"""This is a fire that people are being drawn to because it's not something we understand,"" said Neal Baer, show runner of the ABC drama ""Designated Survivor,"" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol."
9447,资深喜剧作家，《Just the Funny Parts：And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club》的作者尼尔·斯科维尔 (Nell Scovell) 则坚持另一种理论。,"Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of ""Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys"" Club,"" has another theory."
9448,斯科维尔告诉我，她依然记得 2016 年大选前夕在波士顿搭计程车的情景。,She remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
9449,司机告诉她，他会将投票给特朗普。,The driver told her he would be voting for Mr. Trump.
9450,为什么？她问道。,Why? she asked.
9451,“他说，‘因为他能让我笑’。”,"""He said, ""Because he makes me laugh,"""" Ms. Scovell told me."
9452,混乱之中不乏娱乐性。,There is entertainment value in the chaos.
9453,当然，不同于电视上的其他节目，无论这个移民大家庭最终能否重新团结起来，也无论全球经济能否健康发展，华盛顿的这条故事线都有可能决定着罗诉韦德案 (Roe v. Wade) 的未来。,"Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story lines coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy."
9454,而调台则是只有最具特权的观众才能负担得起的奢侈享受。,Tuning out is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
9455,"然而，当你发现自己已经连续 6 小时观看专家小组讨论鲍勃·伍德沃德 (Bob Woodward) 在其著作《恐惧》(Fear) 中所用的“深层背景”根源，保罗·马纳福特 (Paul Manafort) 价值 15,000 美元的鸵鸟毛短夹克（《华盛顿邮报》称其为“傲慢的厚衣服”）以及斯托米·丹尼尔斯 (Stormy Daniels) 有关特朗普（呃，骨骼）耸人听闻的描述所暗指的含义时，你会发现这远远超出了一个普通公民的知情范围。","And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself on hour six of watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of ""deep background"" sourcing for his book ""Fear,"" Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-leather bomber jacket (""a garment thick with hubris,"" The Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's lurid descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy."
9456,就我而言，我再也不会以同样的方式看待《超级马里奥》了。,"I, for one, will never look at Super Mario the same way again."
9457,关于特朗普节目的演员轮换和日常的曲折情节（寻衅与美国职业橄榄球大联盟 (N.F.L.) 对抗，歌颂金正恩），舵手室娱乐制作公司 (Wheelhouse Entertainment) 董事长、《典当之星》(Pawn Stars) 创作者布伦特·蒙哥马利 (Brent Montgomery) 表示，“他正在做的某些事情让人感觉这像是一场真人秀，他每天晚上都在向你灌输一些东西”。,"""Part of what he's doing that makes it feel like a reality show is that he is feeding you something every night,"" said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of ""Pawn Stars,"" about the Trump show's rotating cast and daily plot twists (picking a fight with the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un)."
9458,你一集都不能错过，否则就会跟不上。,You can't afford to miss one episode or you're left behind.
9459,本周我与弗莱斯 (Fleiss) 见面那天是一个晴朗的日子，他位于考艾岛北岸的居所室外温度高达 80 华氏度，但他却在录制 CNN 的节目时，躲在屋里看 MSNBC。,"When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was holed up inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN."
9460,没有布雷特·卡瓦诺 (Brett Kavanaugh) 与他共同面对参议院司法委员会，最高法院的未来也悬而未决，他感到无法摆脱自己。,"He couldn't peel himself away, not with Brett Kavanaugh set to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance."
9461,弗莱斯告诉我，“我记得当我们白天在幕后筹划那些疯狂的节目时，人们说，‘这是西方文明终结的预兆’”。,"""I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows back in the day and people said, ""This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,"""" Mr. Fleiss told me."
9462,“我本以为这听起来有点像笑话，但事实证明他们是对的”。,"""I thought it was sort of a joke, but it turns out they were right."""
9463,艾米·柯西克 (Amy Chozick) 是《泰晤士报》商业、政治和媒体板块的特约编辑，也是回忆录《追逐希拉里》(Chasing Hillary) 的作者。,"Amy Chozick, a writer at large for The Times covering business, politics and media, is the author of the memoir ""Chasing Hillary."""
9464,大笔现金投向最激烈的国会中期选举众议院席位争夺战,Outside money floods into tightest midterm election House races
9465,国会选区的重新划分，引得两名现任议员对宾州第 17 选区同一席位的角逐，大量的现金源源不断地流入，不足为奇。,"It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th is seeing a flood of cash, thanks to a realignment of a congressional districts that landed two incumbents in a race for the same seat."
9466,最近重划的郊区匹兹堡选区，成为了民主党众议员科纳·兰姆 (Conor Lamb) 角逐的目标，而他在去年春天的一次特别选举中，赢得了另一个选区的席位。,This recently redrawn suburban Pittsburg district pits Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
9467,兰姆面临的竞争对手是现任议员共和党人凯斯·罗斯福士 (Keith Rothfus)，目前代表的是原本的宾州第 12 选区，而该选区与新的第 17 选区有重叠。,"Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th."
9468,宾州最高法院于 1 月份作出裁决，称旧的国会选区地图对共和党人有利，属于违宪行为，因此重新划分了选区。,The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally gerrymandered in Republicans' favor.
9469,第 17 选区新席位的角逐，引发了主要党派财政部门——民主党国会竞选委员会 (DCCC) 和共和党国会委员会 (NRCC) 之间的竞选财务问题。,"The race in the new 17th has touched off a campaign finance slugfest between the major party finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC)."
9470,3 月份举行的广受关注的宾州第 18 选区特别选举中，兰姆以微弱的优势险胜，而后，兰姆在宾夕法尼亚州便成了一个家喻户晓的名字。,Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a narrow win in a widely watched in March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
9471,之前，这一席位由共和党人稳坐了十多年，而唐纳德·特朗普总统以 20 个百分点的优势在这个选区获胜。,"That seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points."
9472,政治专家为民主党创造了一点儿优势。,Political pundits have given Democrats a slight edge.
9473,美国曾考虑因萨尔瓦多支持中国而对其进行处罚，但最终选择放弃,"U.S. Weighed Penalizing El Salvador Over Support for China, Then Backed Off"
9474,外交官指出，多米尼加共和国和巴拿马已经认可了北京，几乎没有受到华盛顿的阻拦。,"Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little pushback from Washington."
9475,特朗普于 2017 年 6 月与巴拿马总统胡安·卡洛斯·瓦雷拉 (Juan Carlos Varela) 进行了亲切会面，随后驻留在巴拿马，直至合作伙伴对特朗普政府的管理团队进行驱逐。,Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners evicted the Trump Organization's management team.
9476,国务院发言人海瑟?诺尔特 (Heather Nauert)，于本月早些时候的声明中表示，国务院官员决定就“不再承认台湾的近期决定”，回电美国驻因萨尔瓦、多米尼加共和国和巴拿马的外交使团负责人。,"State Department officials decided to call back the American chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the ""recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,"" Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement early this month."
9477,但只考虑对萨尔瓦多进行处罚，因为该国于 2017 年，在麻醉品管制、开发和经济支持方面曾接受美国约 1.4 亿美元的援助。,"But penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in American aid in 2017, including for narcotics controls, development and economic support."
9478,包括减少经济援助以及有针对性的限制签证等拟定惩罚措施，对该中美洲国家及其较高的失业率和谋杀率将造成沉重打击。,"The proposed penalties, which included cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates."
9479,随着内部会议的进行，北美洲和中美洲的官员们推迟了一场集中关注安全和经济繁荣问题以延续去年举办的类似聚会的高级会议，这一行为被视为为阻止移民前往美国向前迈出了一大步。,"As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States."
9480,但是截至 9 月中旬，高级政府官员明确表示他们希望会议继续进行，这实际上终结了对萨尔瓦多进行处罚的念头。,"But by mid-September, top administration officials made clear that they wanted the conference to go forward, effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador."
9481,副总统迈克·彭斯 (Mike Pence) 目前计划在预计于十月中旬举行的会议上发表讲话，外交官们表示，这是政府当局对此次会议提起重视的一个信号。,"Vice President Mike Pence is now slated to address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a signal of the import the administration places on the gathering, the diplomats said."
9482,三名美国特使悄悄返回萨尔瓦多、巴拿马和多米尼加共和国，没有受到华盛顿最新强硬信息的阻拦或处罚。,"And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new tough messages or punishments from Washington."
9483,博尔顿 (Bolton) 的一位白宫发言人拒绝就这三位美国官员（其中包括两名外交官，他们同意以匿名为条件讨论此次内部审议）所述的辩论细节发表评论。,"A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity."
9484,一位与政府关系密切、不愿意透露姓名的外部分析人士证实了他们的说法。,Their accounts were corroborated by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
9485,研究历史,Study History
9486,下一个需要解决的可能是特别法律顾问罗伯特·米勒 (Robert Mueller) 关于特朗普可能妨碍司法公正的报告，关于这一情况目前公开记录中已有非常确凿的证据。,"The next shoe to drop could be the special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there now is very substantial evidence in the public record."
9487,据报道，米勒将调查方向转向特朗普在竞选活动中是否勾结俄罗斯攻击我们的大选。,Mr. Mueller is reportedly also turning his investigation to whether Mr. Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in its attack on our elections.
9488,如果国会易主，特朗普将面临国会的问责，当他准备再次参选时，或许最终只剩下同僚们组成的陪审团。,"Should Congress change hands, Mr. Trump will find himself facing accountability in that body, just as he prepares to go again before the voters, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers."
9489,这里面有很多假设因素，我的意思并不代表特朗普的失败是必然的结果 - 也不代表他在欧洲的失败是必然的结果。,"That is a lot of ifs, and I do not mean to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his equivalents in Europe."
9490,大西洋两岸的所有人都可以进行选择，而这些选择将决定着这场斗争的持续时间。,There are choices to be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how prolonged the struggle may be.
9491,1938 年，德国军官准备发动一场反对希特勒 (Hitler) 的政变，前提是西方世界在慕尼黑抵抗希特勒，支持捷克斯洛伐克。,"In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d""état against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and backed the Czechoslovaks at Munich."
9492,我们失败了，也错过了避免随之而来的长达数年之久的大屠杀的最好机会。,"We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that ensued."
9493,历史的进程总是以这些转折点为中心，民主势不可挡的前进步伐要么加快、要么减缓。,"The course of history pivots around such inflection points, and democracy's inexorable march is accelerated or delayed."
9494,如今，美国人就面临着几个这样的转折点。,Americans face several of these inflection points now.
9495,如果特朗普炒了司法部副部长罗德·罗森斯坦 (Rod Rosenstein)，那个掌控着米勒调查命运的人，我们该怎么办？,"What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?"
9496,自本报去年报道称罗森斯坦建议对总统进行暗中录音并怀疑特朗普不适合担任这一职务以来，罗森斯坦便已然成为热锅上的蚂蚁。,"Rosenstein has been in hot water ever since this paper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated about his being unfit for office."
9497,罗森斯坦表示《泰晤士报》的说法不准确。,Mr. Rosenstein says The Times's account is inaccurate.
9498,“如果刚刚要求的联邦调查局 (F.B.I.) 对布雷特·卡瓦诺 (Brett Kavanaug) 进行的调查不够全面或有失公平 - 或者如果最高法院没有理会可信的性侵指控和欺诈性的证词而认为确有其事，我们将如何回应?,"""How will we respond if the newly requested F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not full or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?"
9499,首先，我们会在中期选举中投票支持一个将由特朗普承担责任的国会吗?,"And above all, will we vote in the midterms for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?"
9500,如果尝试失败了，民主党将进入漫长的冬季。,"If we fail those tests, democracy will be in for a long winter."
9501,但是我坚信我们不会失败，因为我已经吸取了布拉格的教训。,"But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague."
9502,我的母亲是一名捷克斯洛伐克籍犹太人，她被曾经占领我的大使官邸的纳粹政权驱逐到奥斯维辛。,My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
9503,她活了下来，后来移民到美国，60 年后，我的母亲派我去那张印有纳粹标记的桌子上点燃安息日蜡烛。,"She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me off to light Sabbath candles on that table bearing the swastika."
9504,有了这一继承权，我怎么会对我们的未来感到不乐观呢?,"With that as my heritage, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"""

9507,周四，流浪者队主场迎战维也纳快速队，本月早些时候战平西班牙维拉里尔队后，他们就知道胜利在向奥地利人招手，这将为他们在欧洲联赛 G 组出线奠定有利地位。,"Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League."
9508,膝盖受伤使得中场球员格拉汉姆·多兰斯 (Graham Dorrans) 在 2-2 战平维拉里尔队之前无法出席本赛季的首次亮相，但他相信流浪者队可以以此作为跳板，取得更好的成绩。,A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard to greater things.
9509,“这对我们来说是一次很好的机会，因为维拉里尔队很强大，31 岁的格拉汉姆·多兰斯 (Graham Dorrans) 说到。,"""It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good side,"" said the 31-year-old."
9510,“比赛开始前，我们相信我们一定不回白来，最终我们赢得一分。,"""We went into the game believing we could get something and came away with a point."
9511,或许我们本不应该止步于此，但是，最终打成了平局。,"Maybe we could have nicked it in the end but, overall, a draw was probably a fair result."
9512,他们上半场发挥得较好，而我们下半场表现得更好。,They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better side.
9513,周四将是又一个重要的欧洲之夜。,"Going into Thursday, it's another big European night."
9514,希望我们能得到三分，不过那将是一场棘手的比赛，因为他们在上一场比赛中取得了不错的成绩，但是有这么多人支持我们，我相信我们一定可以继续前进，取得好成绩。,"Hopefully, we can get three points but that will be tough game because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can push on and get a positive result."
9515,去年无疑是非常艰难的一年，我受伤之后发生了很多事情，俱乐部本身也发生了一些变故，但是现在我们感觉良好。,"Last year was definitely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself but there's a feelgood factor about the place now."
9516,球队很好，球员们很享受比赛，训练也很顺利。,The squad's good and the boys are really enjoying it; the training's good.

9519,虽然调查参与者都清楚自己希望获得什么样的护理，但很少有人曾与家人聊过这个问题。,"Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people were talking to their family members about it."
9520,在这项 Nationwide 的研究中，约有一半的人表示自己曾与配偶谈论过长期护理费用的问题。,About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were speaking with their spouses about the cost of long-term care.

9523,如何开始，请看下文。,Here's where to begin.
9524,与配偶和儿女交流：如果不提前告诉家人你的意愿，家人便无法做好照顾你的准备。,Talk to your spouse and the kids: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't make your wishes known well ahead of time.
9525,与你的顾问和家人共同商讨在何处进行护理以及如何获得护理的细节，因为这些选择都是决定成本的重要因素。,"Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost."
9526,让财务顾问参与进来：你的顾问也能帮你想出支付这些费用的方法。,Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
9527,您对长期护理的资金选择可能包括传统的长期护理保险，这是一种现金价值混合人寿保险，可以用于支付这些费用或为自己的财富进行自我保险 （只要您有钱）。,"Your funding choices for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insuring with your own wealth - as long as you have the money."
9528,制定法律文件：避免在关口发生法律纠纷。,Hammer out your legal documents: Head off legal battles at the pass.

9801,“然后我接到了纳德 (Nad) 的电话，说我女儿只剩几分钟的时间了，我不得不在电话里跟她道别。,"""Then I got the call from Nad to say she was going to die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her."
9802,我照做了。,And I did.
9803,我说“亲爱的扎西，我很爱你。,"I said, ""Tashi, I love you so much, darling."
9804,我很快就会去陪你。,I'll be with you soon.
9805,我会一直陪着你。,I'll be with you.
9806,医生给她服用的维持心跳的药物逐渐失效。,The drugs doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping were slowly petering out and leaving her system.
9807,她提前去世了，一切都结束了。,She had died some time before hand and this was it all shutting down.
9808,知道这一切已经发生了，我只能坐在那里等待。,"I had to just sit there and wait, knowing this was all unfolding."
9809,我不能咆哮、尖叫或哭泣，因为我的家人和朋友都在我周围。,I couldn't howl or scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
9810,我必须保持冷静。”,"I had to really hold it together."""
9811,最终正沉浸在丧女之痛中的 Ednan-Laperouse 太太，与其他乘客一同登上了飞机，冷静地似乎忘记了她正在经历的磨难。,"Eventually Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, by now grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane alongside the other passengers - oblivious to the ordeal she was going through."
9812,“没有人能体会到”，她说到。,"""No-one knew,"" she said."
9813,“我低下头，眼泪止不住地往下流。,"""I had my head down, and tears were falling the whole time."
9814,我知道这很难解释，但就是在飞机上，我对纳德 (Nad) 产生了强烈的同情。,"It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad."
9815,他需要我的理解和关爱。,That he needed my love and understanding.
9816,我知道他有多爱自己的女儿。”,"I knew how much he loved her."""
9817,悲伤女子张贴卡片，劝解有轻生念头者回心转意,Grieving women post cards to prevent suicides on bridge
9818,两名失去至亲的女人努力阻止其他人自杀。,Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
9819,Sharon Davis 和 Kelly Humphreys 一直在威尔士桥上张贴卡片，卡片上写着激励的文字，还有电话号码，方便有需要的人获得支持。,Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
9820,Davis 夫人的儿子 Tyler 在 13 岁那年，患上了抑郁症，18 岁时自杀身亡。,Ms Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering with depression and killed himself aged 18.
9821,“我不想再有别的父母经历我每天都在承受的痛苦”，她说道。,"""I don't want any parent to feel the way I have to feel everyday,"" she said."
9822,Davis 夫人家住 Lydney，今年 45 岁，她的儿子是一位前途无量的厨师，脸上总是挂着有感染力的笑容。,"Ms Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious grin."
9823,“大家都知道他是个爱笑的人。,"""Everyone knew him for his smile."
9824,人们总是说，他的笑能让满屋子的人都高兴起来。”,"They always said his smile lit up any room."""
9825,可是，他放弃了工作，不久便离世了，他去了“一个特别黑暗的地方”。,"However, he gave up work before he died, as he was ""in a really dark place."""
9826,2014 年，Tyler 的弟弟当时刚刚满 11 岁，就是他发现了 Tyler 结束了自己的生命。,"In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one to find his sibling after he had taken his own life."
9827,Davis 说道：“我一直担心，他的自杀会产生连带反应。”,"Ms Davis said: ""I continually worry that there's going to be a knock on effect."""
9828,于是 Davis 制作了卡片，“希望人们知道，有人愿意帮你，愿意聆听你的倾诉，即使我们是朋友也没关系。,"Ms Davis created the cards, ""to let people know there are people out there that you can go to and you can talk to, even if it's a friend."
9829,不要沉默不语，你需要倾诉。”,"Don't sit in silence - you need to talk."""
9830,Humphreys 夫人是 Davies 夫人多年的朋友，在母亲去世不久，她的丈夫也离开了自己，如今已经有 15 年的光景了。,"Ms Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after the death of his mother."
9831,她介绍称，“他从没有跟我们说过，感觉情绪低落或是抑郁寡欢什么的。,"""He didn't say that he was feeling down or depressed or anything,"" she said."
9832,就在圣诞前几天，我们注意到，他的情绪不太对。,"""A couple of days before Christmas we noticed his change in attitude."
9833,圣诞节当天，孩子们打开自己的礼物，他也没有什么眼神交流之类的，当时他的情绪已经跌入了最低谷。”,"He was at rock bottom on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents he didn't make eye contact with them or anything."""
9834,她说，丈夫的死给他们带来了巨大的创伤，可他们还得继续生活下去：“他死后，家里的天都塌了。,"She said his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to work through it: ""It rips a hole through the family."
9835,我们大家都悲痛欲绝。,It tears us apart.
9836,可是我们还是得继续生活，继续战斗。”,"But we've all got to carry on and fight."""
9837,如果你有什么难言的困难，可以免费致电 116 123（英国和爱尔兰）联系 Samaritans，发送电子邮件至 @samaritans.org，或者访问 Samaritans 网站。,"If you are struggling to cope, you can call Samaritans free on 116 123 (UK and Ireland), email jo@samaritans.org, or visit the Samaritans website here."
9838,联邦调查局 (FBI) 展开调查，布雷特·卡瓦诺 (Brett Kavanaugh) 前途未卜,Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI begins investigation
9839,“我想，如果我们能够真正得到他想要的东西 - 一项在时间、范围上都很受限的调查 - 那么或许我们还能挽回一丝团结”，弗雷克 (Flake) 于周六表示，他补充称，自己担心委员会会借此机会“开始瓦解”根深蒂固的党派僵局。,"""I thought, if we could actually get something like what he was asking for - an investigation limited in time, limited in scope - we could maybe bring a little unity,"" said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was ""falling apart"" amid entrenched partisan gridlock."
9840,为什么卡瓦诺及其共和党支持者们不希望联邦调查局 (FBI) 进行调查呢？,Why didn't Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
9841,他们的不情愿完全是因为时机问题。,Their reluctance is all due to timing.
9842,距离 11 月 6 日的中期选举只剩下 5 周的时间，如果如我们所料，共和党表现不佳，那么他们尝试推举美国最高法院候选人的努力将受到重创。,"The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do badly, then they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land."
9843,乔治·W·布什 (George W. Bush) 一直不停致电参议员们，试图游说他们支持卡瓦诺，因为卡瓦诺曾在白宫为布什政府效力，并通过布什结识了他的妻子，布什的私人秘书阿什利 (Ashley)。,"George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call Senators, lobbying them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr Bush's personal secretary."
9844,联邦调查局 (FBI) 发布报告后会怎样？,What happens after the FBI produces its report?
9845,参议院将进行投票，目前参议院有 51 个共和党席位和 49 民主党席位。,"There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit."
9846,目前尚不清楚，卡瓦诺能否在参议院获得至少 50 票的支持，以打破与副总统迈克·彭斯 (Mike Pence) 之间的平局，从而确认最高法院候选人的提名。,"It's still not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court."
9847,金正恩政权下的朝鲜叛逃人数“下降”,North Korea defector numbers 'drop' under Kim
9848,韩国的一位立法者表示，自七年前金正恩上台以来，叛逃到韩国的朝鲜人数量下降。,"The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said."
9849,"Park Byeong-seug 援引韩国统一部的数据称，去年总计 1,127 名朝鲜人叛逃到韩国，而 2011 年，总计有 2,706 名。","Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South's unification ministry, said there had been 1,127 defections last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011."
9850,Park 先生表示，叛逃人数减少的关键原因是朝鲜与中国边境管制的加强，以及人口走私团伙收取的费用增长。,Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by people smugglers were key factors.
9851,朝鲜没有公开发表评论。,Pyongyang has made no public comments.
9852,绝大多数叛逃到韩国的朝鲜人，最终都能获得韩国公民身份。,The vast majority of defectors from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
9853,"韩国表示，自 1953 年朝鲜战争结束以来，已有 30,000 多名朝鲜人非法越过边界来到韩国。","Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953."
9854,多数叛逃者系经由中国逃到朝鲜，因为朝鲜同中国的边界线最长，而且比朝韩两国之间严加防守的非军事区 (DMZ) 更容易越过。,"Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas."
9855,中国认为叛逃者为非法移民，而非难民，所以常常会将其强行遣返回国。,China regards the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
9856,最近几个月，朝鲜与韩国两国之间的关系，显著改善，虽然从技术上来讲，仍处于战争状态。,Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war - have markedly improved in recent months.
9857,本月初，两国领导人在平壤举行会谈，就陷入僵局的无核化谈判展开对话。,"Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that centred on the stalled denuclearisation negotiations."
9858,两国关系的改善得益于 6 月美国总统唐纳德·特朗普与金正恩在新加坡举行的历史性会晤，会晤期间，双方大体同意在朝着朝鲜半岛无核化的方向努力。,"This came after June's historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in broad terms to work towards the nuclear-free Korean peninsula."
9859,但周六，朝鲜外务相李勇浩指责称，自会晤结束之后，并未取得进展，因为美国仍在实施制裁。,"But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then."
9860,“如果美国不值得信赖，那我们就无法确保本国安全能够得到保障，因此我们绝对不可能单方面解除核武器”，李勇浩在纽约举行的联合国大会上发表讲话这样介绍道。,"""Without any trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first,"" Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York."
9861,Nancy Pelosi 称 Brett Kavanaugh“歇斯底里”，不适合担任最高法院法官之职,"Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh ""hysterical,"" says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court"
9862,众议院少数党领袖南希·佩洛西 (Nancy Pelosi) 称，最高法院提名人布雷特·卡瓦诺 (Brett Kavanaugh)“歇斯底里”，脾气不适合担任最高法院法官之职。,"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh ""hysterical"" and said that he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court."
9863,佩洛西在周六于德克萨斯州奥斯汀 (Austin) 举办的得克萨斯论坛 (Texas Tribune Festival ) 上接受采访时，这样评价道。,"Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas."
9864,“我忍不住想，如果一个女人有这样的行为，他们会用'歇斯底里'来形容，”佩洛西此番言论，针对的是周四卡瓦诺在参议院司法委员会所做的证言陈述。,"""I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever performed that way, they would say 'hysterical,'"" Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday."
9865,卡瓦诺情绪失控，针对克里斯汀·布莱西·福特 (Christine Blasey Ford) 博士所提出的控告，他称自己年少时没有性侵过年少时的福特。,Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
9866,卡瓦诺在他的开场发言中，情绪失控，在讨论自己的家庭和高中生活时，几次几乎是在喊叫，甚至说不出话来。,"During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times nearly shouting and choking up while discussing his family and his high school years."
9867,他还明确谴责与会的民主党人，称这一指控是由自由党组织的一次“怪诞联合式人身攻击”，因为自由党对希拉里·克林顿 (Hillary Clinton) 败选 2016 年总统大选而心怀愤恨。,"He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a ""grotesque and coordinated character assassination"" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election."
9868,佩洛西称，她相信卡瓦诺的证词证明，他无法胜任最高法院的职位，因为这表明，他对民主党人有偏见。,"Pelosi said that she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed that he is biased against Democrats."
9869,她说：“我觉得他的那些证言，还有他对克林顿和民主党人的态度，说明他资格不够”。,"""I think that he disqualifies himself with those statements and the manner in which he went after the Clintons and the Democrats,"" she said."
9870,在被问及，如果最终证实卡瓦诺罪名成立，如果民主党在众议院获得多数席位，是否会弹劾卡瓦诺时，佩洛西表示异议。,"Pelosi demurred when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if Democrats gain the majority in the House of Representatives."
9871,佩洛西说道：“这样说吧，如果他对国会或者 FBI 说的并非事实，那么他不光是不适合担任最高法院之职，而且还不配在现在就职的法庭任职”。,"""I will say this -- if he is not telling the truth to Congress or to the FBI, then he's not fit not only to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he's on right now,"" Pelosi said."
9872,卡瓦诺目前是华盛顿 DC 巡回上诉法院的法官。,Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
9873,佩洛西补充说，作为一名民主党人，自己担心卡瓦诺可能会对“平价医疗法案” (Affordable Care Act) 或 “罗诉韦德案”(Roe v. Wade) 作出否定裁决，因为他属于保守派司法官。,"Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered to be a conservative justice."
9874,卡瓦诺在确认听证会，回避了自己是否会推翻某些最高法院裁决的问题。,"In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh sidestepped questions on whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions."
9875,“现在，不适合让一个歇斯底里、心怀偏见的人到法院任职，还希望我们说一句'这不是很好吗’”，佩洛西这样说道。,"""It's not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to the court and expect us to say, 'isn't that wonderful,'"" Pelosi said."
9876,妇女需要行使自己的权力。,And Women Need to Wield It.
9877,那是一次正义的诽谤，长达数月、甚至数年的愤怒不断蔓延，如果不哭出来，她将无法摆脱。,"It is a righteous diatribe, months and years of fury spilling over, and she can't get it out without weeping."
9878,斯泰纳姆 (Steinem ) 45 年后对我说，“我们生气的时候会哭”。,"""We cry when we get angry,"" Ms. Steinem said to me 45 years later."
9879,“我认为这很正常，你觉得呢？”,"""I don't think that's uncommon, do you?"""
9880,她继续道，“一位女士给予了我很大的帮助，她是某家公司的主管，她说她生气的时候也会哭，但是她发现了一个诀窍，那就是当她气得开始哭的时候，她会向与她对话的人诉说”，你就会知道我很难过，因为我哭了。,"She continued, ""I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive someplace, who said she also cried when she got angry, but developed a technique which meant that when she got angry and started to cry, she'd say to the person she was talking to, ""You may think I am sad because I am crying."
9881,我在生气。“,"I am angry."""
9882,然后她继续到。,And then she just kept going.
9883,我觉得这简直太棒了。”,"And I thought that was brilliant."""
9884,我们之所以用眼泪来发泄愤怒，部分原因是因为我们从根本上误解了眼泪。,Tears are permitted as an outlet for wrath in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
9885,我印象最深刻的一件事是在我早年的一份工作中，那是一家男性占主导地位的公司，有一次我因为无法形容的愤怒而哭泣，然后我被一个老女人（一个我对她一直有些畏惧的冷漠的经理）抓住后颈，她把我拖进了楼梯间。,"One of my sharpest memories from an early job, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself weeping with inexpressible rage, was my being grabbed by the scruff of my neck by an older woman - a chilly manager of whom I'd always been slightly terrified - who dragged me into a stairwell."
9886,她警告我说“永远也不要让他们看到你哭”。,"""Never let them see you crying,"" she told me."
9887,“他们不知道你在生气。,"""They don't know you're furious."
9888,他们会认为你很难过，并为此感到高兴，因为他们打败了你。”,"They think you're sad and will be pleased because they got to you."""
9889,时任科罗拉多州民主党国会女议员的帕特丽夏·施罗德 (Patricia Schroeder) 曾与加里·哈特 (Gary Hart) 一同参加总统竞选。,"Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential runs."
9890,1987 年，哈特因在一艘名为“Monkey 商务晚餐船”的船上卷入一场婚外情而退出竞选，施罗德十分沮丧，认为自己应该亲自实践竞选总统的这一想法。,"In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and bowed out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, figured there was no reason she shouldn't explore the idea of running for president herself."
9891,“那并不是一个经过深思熟虑的决定”，30 年后她笑着对我说。,"""It was not a well-thought-out decision,"" she said to me with a laugh 30 years later."
9892,“当时已经有七位其他候选人参加竞选，而他们也不那么需要另外一位候选人。,"""There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one."
9893,有人将这称为‘白雪公主和七个小矮人’。”,"Somebody called it ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."""""
9894,因为已经进入竞选后期，施罗德在募集资金方面较为落后，因此她发誓除非筹集到 200 万美元，否则决不参加竞选。,"Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind on fund-raising, and so she vowed that she wouldn't enter the race unless she raised $2 million."
9895,这无疑是一场必败之战。,It was a losing battle.
9896,"她发现，一些支持者为男性竞选者捐赠了 1,000 美元，却只给了她 250 美元。","She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would give her only $250."
9897,“他们认为我需要折扣吗？”，施罗德怀疑到。,"""Do they think I get a discount?"" she wondered."
9898,当她发表演讲宣布不会发起正式的竞选活动时，她被各种复杂的情绪所困扰 - 对支持者的感激；对令她难以筹集资金和难以瞄准目标投票者而非代表的体制的失望；以及对性别歧视的愤怒 - 她开始哽咽。,"When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overcome by emotions - gratitude for the people who'd supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and to target voters rather than delegates, and anger at the sexism - that she got choked up."
9899,施罗德回忆起媒体对她的反应时说道，“你应该会认为我精神崩溃了”。,"""You would have thought I'd had a nervous breakdown,"" recalled Ms. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her."
9900,“你可能会想到克里奈克斯 (Kleenex) 是我的企业赞助商。,"""You'd have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
9901,我记得当时我在想，他们会在我的墓碑上刻下什么?,"I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?"
9902,‘她哭了’？”,"""She cried""?"""""
9903,中美贸易战将为北京方面带来哪些利益,How the US-China trade war may be good for Beijing
9904,专业人士表示，美中贸易战的开火声势浩大，尽管战争才刚刚开始，但从长远来看，两国之间的分歧可能对北京方面较为有利。,"The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a rift between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say."
9905,今年年初，美国总统唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump) 首次警告称，即将对中国的主要出口产品征税，包括太阳能电池板、钢铁和铝。,"Donald Trump, the US President, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium."
9906,贸易战本周发生严重升级，新的关税将对中国入口美国的一半商品征税，影响波及价值 2000 亿美元（1500 亿欧元）的商品。,"The most significant escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of items, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China."
9907,北京方面每次都以同样的方式进行报复，最近一次对价值 600 亿美元的美国商品提高了 5% 至 10% 的关税。,"Beijing has retaliated each time in kind, most recently slapping tariffs of five to ten per cent on $60 billion of American goods."
9908,中国已承诺与美国对抗到底，全球第二大经济体绝不会在短期内退缩。,"China has pledged to match the US shot-for-shot, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to blink anytime soon."
9909,让华盛顿方面做出让步意味着需要满足他们的要求，但公开向美国屈服对中国国家主席习近平来说实在过于难堪。,"Getting Washington to back down means caving into demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president."
9910,尽管如此，专业人士表示，如果北京方面能打好这手牌，那么美国贸易战的压力可能会降低两国经济的相互依赖程度，为中国带来长期的积极支持。,"Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards right, US trade war pressures could positively support China over the long term by lowering the inter-dependence of the two economies."
9911,新美国安全中心 (Center for New American Security) 智库一位亚洲领域的助理研究员，阿比盖尔·格雷斯 (Abigail Grace) 表示，“如果华盛顿或北京方面快速做出政治决策，那么可能会导致两国引发经济混乱，这实际上比此前已经获得认可的坐视不管的境遇更加危险”。,"""The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start an economic tailspin in either country is actually a lot more dangerous than onlookers have acknowledged before,"" said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank."
9912,外交部长说称叙利亚已“准备好”迎接难民回国,"Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister"
9913,叙利亚表示，已准备好让难民自愿回国，并呼吁各界人士，帮助其重建饱受七年多战争之苦的家园。,Syria says it's ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by a more than seven-year long war.
9914,外交部长 Walid al-Moualem 在联合国大会上表示，叙利亚的条件正在好转。,"Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving."
9915,“由于在打击恐怖主义工作上取得了进展，如今，地面上趋于稳定，更安全”，他说道。,"""Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress made in combating terrorism,"" he said."
9916,叙利亚政府仍将对恐怖分子摧毁的地区进行修复，使其恢复正常。,The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
9917,目前，迎接难民自愿回国的所有条件都已准备好。出境逃亡的难民因恐怖主义以及针对日常生活和生计的单方面经济措施，都是被迫无奈，不得不离开的家园。,All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and their livelihoods.
9918,据联合国估计，自 2011 年战争爆发以来，已有逾 550 万叙利亚人逃离出境。,The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
9919,而留在叙利亚的其他 600 万人，仍需要人道主义援助。,Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
9920,Al-Moualem 表示，叙利亚政权欢迎其他国家援助其重建饱受蹂躏的家园。,Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
9921,但他强调，不会接受有条件的援助或支援叛乱活动国家的帮助。,But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that sponsored the insurgency.
9922,欧洲队夺得巴黎莱德杯的胜利,Europe clinches Ryder Cup victory in Paris
9923,在法国巴黎郊外的国家高尔夫球场 (Le Golf National) 举行的 2018 年莱德杯比赛中，欧洲队以 16.5 比 10.5 的最终成绩，击败美国队。,"Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France."
9924,美国现已连续六次在欧洲土地上失利，自 1993 年以来，一直没有在欧洲赢得过莱德杯。,The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
9925,丹麦队队长托马斯·比约恩 (Thomas Bjorn) 的球队率先拿到了击败美国所需的 14.5 分，欧洲重新获得了冠军。,Europe regained the crown as the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they required to beat the United States.
9926,美国球星菲尔·米克尔森 (Phil Mickelson) 在比赛的大部分比赛中挣扎，他在第 16 洞，第三杆击球下水后，直接向弗朗西斯科·莫利纳里 (Francesco Molinari) 认输。,"US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled most of the tournament, plunked his tee-shot into the water at the par-3 16th hole, conceding his match to Francesco Molinari."
9927,意大利高尔夫球手莫利纳里 (Molinari) 在所有轮次中都大放异彩，成为自锦标赛以当前的形式于 1979 年开始以来，四个打出了 5-0-0 的成绩的球员之一。,"The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all of his rounds, becoming 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format begun in 1979."
9928,美国选手乔斯·斯皮斯 (Jordan Spieth) 被欧洲队排名最低的球员丹麦的托尔比约恩·奥莱森 (Thorbjorn Olesen) 以5 比 4 战败。,"American Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&amp;4 by the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark."
9929,世界排名第一的球员达斯汀·约翰逊 (Dustin Johnson) 以 2 比 1 落后于英格兰的伊恩·保尔特 (Ian Poulter)，有望参加他最后一场莱德杯比赛。,"The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup."

9975,据英媒称，美国海军作战副部长威廉・莫兰上将说，即便美国海军正在重振力量以便在大西洋两岸应对日益令人担忧的俄罗斯时，美国仍继续把亚太地区 ― ― 五角大楼把该地区的范围扩大到包括印度洋-亚洲-太平洋 ― ― 作为海军的重点。,"According to the UK media, Admiral William Moran, the deputy director of Naval Operations, said that even though the US Navy was reinvigorating to cope with the increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States would continue to take the Asia-Pacific region as the focus of its navy -- the Pentagon had expanded the scope of Asia-Pacific region to include the Indian Ocean - Asia - the Pacific."
9976,据英国《简氏防务周刊》网站9月24日报道，美国在年初公布的新国防战略中把中俄列为战略竞争对手。,"According to the reports from the site of ""Jane's Defence Weekly"" on September 24, China and Russia were classified as the strategic competitors in the new national defense strategy, which was announced by the United States at the beginning of the year."
9977,此后，美国海军恢复了第二舰队，以便更直接地对抗俄罗斯的活动。,"Then, the US Navy recommissioned the Second Fleet to stand up against the Russian activities more directly."
9978,报道称，这些举动在盟友和分析人士中引发一些质疑和担忧，他们担心美国海军可能会远离标志着奥巴马政府的“亚太再平衡”战略。,"It was reported that these actions raised some doubts and concerns among its allies and analysts. They were afraid that the US Navy might go far away from the strategy of ""Rebalancing toward Asia-Pacific"", which marked the Obama administration."
9979,但莫兰上将说，美国海军的重点仍然是西太平洋。,"However, Admiral William Moran said that the focus of the US Navy would still focus on the West Pacific."
9980,2018年1月24日在美国国家亚洲研究局在华盛顿主办的名为“应对公海挑战”的圆桌讨论会上，他说 ： “ 对我们来说，没有发生重大变化 。 ”,"At the round-table discussion, which was hosted by National Bureau of Asian Research in Washington on January 24, 2018, he said: ""For us, there are any significant changes. """
9981,莫兰说 ： “ 重点仍然是再平衡、重心转移或不管你想怎么描述它 。 ”,"Moran said: ""The focus remains on rebalancing, shifting focus or whatever you want to describe it. """
9982,不过他承认，美国与欧洲关系密切。,But he admitted that the United States kept close relations with Europe.
9983,他说 ： “ 我们将继续关注西海岸的增长，并平衡我们能做的 。 ”,"He said: ""We would continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast. """
9984,虽然莫兰指出有关俄罗斯的总体政策属于美国国防部长的职权范围，但他警告说 ： “ 俄罗斯人可能面临人口和经济上的挑战，但历史证明，如果我们与他们发生冲突，他们会非常强硬 。 ”,"Although he pointed out that the overall policy about Russia fell within the terms of reference of the United States Secretary of Defense, he warned: ""The Russians might face the demographic and economic challenges, but the history demonstrates that they will become very tough if we have a conflict with them. """
9985,莫兰上将说，作为美国对抗俄罗斯、中国和其他竞争者的东山再起行动的一部分，美国海军正在动态地把部队部署成一个“新的作战模式 ” ， 这将有助于让对手对美国航母战斗群或其他资产在任何特定时间和地点将部署在哪里措手不及。,"Admiral Moran said that as a part of the comeback action to fight against Russia, China and other competitors, the US Navy was dynamically deploying the troops into a ""new campaign mode"". This would help to make the opponents unaware unprepared for the deployments of the American aircraft carrier battle group or other assets at any specified time and place."
9986,他说 ： “ 我们海军和海军陆战队支持它 ― ― 作战不可预测性的概念，不要一次又一次地出现在同一个地方，几乎像发条一样 ― ― 这是我们的做法 。 ”,"He said: ""Our Navy and Marine Corps support it -- the concept of unpredictable battle. We should not show up at the same place again and again like clockwork. -- This is our approach. """
9987,报道称，最早尝试这种新做法的是“哈里・杜鲁门”号航母战斗群，该战斗群的早期部署包括对港口的工作访问以及在通常只通过的区域进行巡逻。,"It was reported that the first to try this new approach was the ""Harry Truman"" aircraft carrier battle group, and its early deployment included the working visits to ports and the patrols in areas, where it usually only passed."
9988,莫兰说，目前美国海军正在努力确保盟友知道这些军舰仍将在传统区域巡逻，并且还在为新的部署程序解决后勤和家庭联络问题。,"Moran said that the US Navy was currently trying to ensure its allies to know that these warships would still patrol in the traditional areas, and solving the logistical problems and family liaison problems for new deployment process."
9989,澳大利亚皇家海军司令迈克尔・努南中将也在这次活动中发表讲话，称澳大利亚军队可以与美国的航母战斗群无缝合作。,"Vice Admiral Michael Noonan, the Commander of Royal Australian Navy, also delivered a speech in this event to indicate that the Australian army could seamlessly cooperate with the American aircraft carrier battle group."
9990,他说，随着澳大利亚皇家海军计划再采购9艘配备“宙斯盾”作战系统的护卫舰，这种情况还将继续。,"He said that this situation would continue as the Royal Australian Navy had planned to purchase another 9 frigates with the ""Aegis"" combat system."

When the passenger ticket is exchanged, the fuel surcharge will not be refunded and compensated."
9996,这意味着10月5日以前出票的国内航线客票，如果要变更至10月5日（含）以后，不用按新标准补交燃油附加费。,"This means that if the domestic route ticket issued before October 5th is changed to after October 5th (including), the fuel surcharge will not be paid according to the new standard."

10064,人民网北京11月5日电(王小艳)在当前“大众创业，万众创新”的浪潮下，越来越多的科技公司开始重视专利研发及相关的保护工作，深挖专利的潜在价值，占据市场主导权。,"People’s Daily Online, Beijing, November 5 (Wang Xiaoyan) - In the current tide of ""mass entrepreneurship and innovation"", more and more technology companies have begun to pay attention to patent R&amp;D and related protection work, and deeply explore the potential value of patents to occupy the market domination."
10065,同样，也有不少科技企业在专利技术授权、专利技术使用等方面遭遇了不小的侵权风波。,"Similarly, many technology companies have encountered numerous infringements crisis in patent technology licensing and patent technology use."
10066,2017年底来自广东省的谭卫、何章鸿、赖斌三人以专利侵权为由，将“滴滴出行”APP的开发商北京小桔科技有限公司(下称小桔科技 ) 、 运营商滴滴出行科技有限公司(下称滴滴出行 ) 、 销售商广东太平洋互联网信息服务有限公司(下称广东太平洋)诉至广州知识产权法院。,"At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Lai Bin from Guangdong Province, on the grounds of patent infringement, appealed the developer of ""Didi Chuxing"" APP, Beijing Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Xiaoju Technology), the operator, Didi Chuxing Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Didi Chuxing), the seller, Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Limited (hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific) to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court."
10067,三原告请求法院判令，三被告立即停止制造、销售、许诺销售、使用原告的专利行为。,"The three plaintiffs requested the court to order that the three defendants immediately stopped the actions of manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, and using the plaintiff’s patent."
10068,2018年10月30日，中国裁判文书网公布了“谭卫、何章鸿等与北京小桔科技有限公司等侵害发明专利权纠纷一审民事裁定书 ” ， 披露了滴滴出行APP被诉专利侵权的部分案件细节。,"On October 30, 2018, China Judgment Online published the ""First-instance Civil Ruling Paper of Infringement of Invention Patent Rights between Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Beijing Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd."", which disclosed some details of case in which the Didi Chuxing APP was sued for patent infringement."
10069,三原告认为“基于移动终端的拼车服务系统及方法 ”专利的专利权人及发明人，而“滴滴出行”APP中“顺风车”应用的整个运作过程与涉案专利保护的技术方案对应，构成了专利侵权行为。,"The three plaintiffs believe that they are the patentees and inventors of the ""carpooling service system and method based on mobile terminals"", and the whole operation process of the ""ride-sharing"" application in the ""Didi Chuxing"" APP corresponds to the technical solution of the patent protection involved in the case, which formed a patent infringement."
10070,然而在法院裁定期间，小桔科技认为，广东太平洋不是适格的被告，其仅仅在网络上提供了涉案APP“滴滴出行”的免费下载，并未实施涉案专利方法，不存在直接或间接侵权行为，不应被列为本案被告。,"However, during the court’s ruling, Xiaoju Technology believed that Guangdong Pacific was not an eligible defendant. It only provided free downloads of the involved APP ""Didi Chuxing"" on the Internet, and did not implement the patent method involved. There was no direct or indirect infringement behavior, and it should not be included as a defendant in this case."
10071,其次，本案侵权行为地不在广东。,"Secondly, the infringement of this case was not in Guangdong."
10072,依照法律规定，涉案专利的侵权行为地应为完整地实施涉案专利方法的地点，因此对法院管辖权提出了异议，要求将本案移送到被告住所地法院即北京知识产权法院审理。,"According to the law, the infringement of the patent involved should be the place where the patent method involved in the case was completely implemented. Therefore, the jurisdiction of the court was challenged and the case was requested to be transferred to the court of the defendant's domicile, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court."
10073,广州知识产权法院认为，被告广东太平洋在其网络平台上提供了被控侵权滴滴出行APP产品，原告将被告广东太平洋列为被告并无不妥。,The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant Guangdong Pacific provided the alleged infringement Didi Chuxing APP product on its online platform. It is not inappropriate for the plaintiff to list Guangdong Pacific as a defendant.
10074,并且被告广东太平洋住所地在广州市，隶属于广州知识产权法院的辖区范围内。,"And the defendant Guangdong Pacific’s domicile is located in Guangzhou, under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court."
10075,被告小桔科技主张将该案移送北京知识产权法院审理，依据不足，驳回被告小桔科技有限公司对本案管辖权提出的异议，并承担管辖权异议案件受理费用。,"The defendant Xiaoju Technology advocated that the case be transferred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial with inadequate evidence. The Court dismissed the defendant Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd.’s objection to the jurisdiction of the case, and ordered it assume the acceptance fee for the case."
10076,目前该案件的其他审理情况还未公布，记者还将密切关注滴滴出行专利侵权案的后续细节。,"At present, the other trials of the case have not been announced, and the reporter will pay close attention to the follow-up details of the patent infringement case of Didi Chuxing."

10087,除上述合作外，CSIRO还在建设平方公里阵列射电望远镜、研发新型燃料技术、节能减排等方面与中国科研机构有着密切合作。,"In addition to the above cooperations, CSIRO is also working closely with Chinese scientific research institutions in the construction of Square Kilometer Array radio telescope, research and development of new fuel technologies, energy conservation and emission reduction."
10088,“以往的科学研究往往着眼的都是上百年以后的问题，而当下需要更多的科研力量来解决摆在面前的问题 。 ”,"""In the past, scientific researches often focused on problems after hundreds of years, and now more scientific research power is needed to solve the problems in front of them. """
10089,马歇尔认为，澳中两国在科学发展领域具有互补性，同时两国在发展中都面临着一系列挑战。,"Marshall believed that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, and both countries face a series of challenges in their development progress."
10090,例如极端天气在全球频频出现，干旱和洪水导致了粮食减产，食物短缺严重影响了人类的发展。,"For example, extreme weather occurs frequently in the world. Drought and floods have led to a reduction in food production and food shortages have seriously affected human development."
10091,同时，人口爆炸、老龄化、慢性病等问题也是目前面临的严峻挑战。,"At the same time, population explosion, aging, chronic disease and other problems are also the serious challenges we faced."
10092,“澳中两国近年来的合作就是主要着眼于解决这些当下的难题 。 ”,"""The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has focused on solving these current problems. """
10093,马歇尔介绍说，CSIRO与青岛海洋科学与技术国家实验室共建的国际南半球海洋研究中心，其工作重点便是观测厄尔尼诺现象和拉尼娜现象，研究两者与极端天气之间的关系，并建立极端天气的预警设施；CSIRO与中科院共同开发的克服极端天气的谷物新品种，也可以缓解由极端天气造成的食物短缺问题。,"Marshall said that the key job of Center for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research, jointly established by CSIRO and National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao), are observing El Nino phenomenon and La Nina phenomenon, studying the relationships between these two phenomenons and extreme weather, and establishing early warning facilities for extreme weather. The new species of cereals developed by CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences can overcome extreme weather and can also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather."
10094,“目前的环境下，科技创新很难独自完成，需要极高的成本，待解决的问题也非常多，所以合作在当今显得尤为重要 。 ”,"""In the current environment, technological innovation is difficult to accomplish by oneself, it requires extremely high costs, and there are many problems to be solved, so cooperation is particularly important today. """
10095,马歇尔表示，合作越紧密就越有可能取得突破性进展，这也是澳中双方在“一带一路”框架下加强合作的意义。,"Marshall expressed that the closer the cooperation is, the more likely it is to make breakthroughs. This is also the significance of Australia and China in strengthening cooperation under the framework of the ""One Belt One Road""."
10096,“加强双边合作，对于我们来说主要是科技方面的合作 。 ”,"""Strengthening bilateral cooperation is mainly for cooperation in science and technology for us. """
10097,马歇尔举例说，CSIRO最新研发出一种不使用氰化物的黄金提纯法，因传统的氰化物黄金提纯法对环境危害非常大，很多国家都希望能找到一种对环境污染小的黄金提纯方法。,"Marshall took the example that CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method without using cyanide. Because the traditional cyanide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, many countries hope to find a way to purify gold with little environmental pollution."
10098,“我们很愿意将这项技术引进中国，这是我们参与‘一带一路’合作取得的成果之一 。 ”,"""We are very willing to introduce this technology to China. This is one of the achievements of our participation in the ""One Belt One Road"" cooperation. """

Since ancient times, it has been an important passage for connecting the south and north parts of Mount Tianshan, communicating with Xinjiang and the mainland, and connecting China and Central Asia, West Asia and Europe. It is an important window for China’s opening to the west and foreign economic and cultural exchanges, and has a good investment environment."

10120,朝鲜外务相李勇浩周六对联合国表示，继续实施制裁在加深朝鲜对美国的不信任，朝鲜不可能在这样的情况下单边放弃核武器。,"Ri Yong Ho, the foreign minister North Korea, told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were deepening the distrust of the United States on North Korea and it was impossible for North Korea to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such circumstances."
10121,李勇浩在联合国大会上称，朝鲜过去一年采取了“非常友善的做法 ” ， 包括停止导弹和核试验，拆除核试验场，并承诺不扩散核武器和核技术。,"Ri Yong Ho said on the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea had taken ""very kind actions"" during the last year, including cessation of missile and nuclear tests, dismantling of nuclear test sites and commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies"
10122,“但我们没有看到美国任何相应的回应 ， ” 他称。,"""However, we haven’t seen any corresponding response from the United States,"" he said."
10123,“对美国不信任的话，对我们的国家安全就没有信心，在这样的情况下，我们不可能先单边放弃武器 。 ”,"""If the United States doesn’t trust on us, we have no confidence in our national security. It is impossible for us to unilaterally abandon the nuclear weapons under such circumstances. """
10124,虽然李勇浩是重复朝鲜对美国反对“分阶段”去核化的抱怨，但他的讲话具有重大意义，因为没有像朝鲜以前那样，完全拒绝单边去核化。,"Although Ri Yong Ho repeated the complaints of North Korea about the opposition of United States to ""phased"" denuclearization, his speech was of great significance because it did not completely refuse the unilateral denuclearization as North Korea had before."
10125,李勇浩提到金正恩和特朗普6月12日的联合声明，当时金正恩同意朝“朝鲜半岛去核化”努力，特朗普则承诺保护朝鲜安全。,"Ri Yong Ho mentioned the joint statement between Jeong-eun Kim and Trump on June 12, and at that time Jeong-eun Kim agreed to work towards the ""denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula"", while Trump promised to protect the security of North Korea."
10126,朝鲜一直寻求正式结束1950-53年的朝鲜战争，但美国称朝鲜必须先放弃核武器。,"North Korea has always been seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that North Korea must firstly abandon nuclear weapons."
10127,美国也拒绝放松对朝鲜国际制裁的要求。,The United States also refused to loose the requirements for the international sanctions on North Korea.
10128,“美国坚持‘先去核化 ’ ， 并加大制裁压力，以高压方式达到目的，甚至拒绝发表‘战争结束宣言 ’ ， ”李勇浩称。,"""The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goals in a high-pressure manner, and even refuses to issue the ‘declaration of the end of the war’,"" Ri Yong Ho said."
10129,“认为制裁能让我们跪地求饶的想法，是不了解我们的人在做白日梦。,"""The thought that sanctions can make us kneel and beg forgiveness is the daydream of the people who don't know us."
10130,但问题是这种持续制裁在加深我们的不信任 。 ”,"However, the problem is that such continued sanctions are deepening our distrust. """
10131,李勇浩没有提到美国总统本周稍早在联合国提到的第二次特金会计划。,Ri Yong Ho did not mention the second Trump-Kim summit plan mentioned by the US President earlier this week at the United Nations.
10132,相反，他强调了金正恩和韩国总统文在寅在过去五个月的三次会面，并表示 ： “ 如果去核化的另一方是韩国而不是朝鲜，那么朝鲜半岛去核化不会变得这么僵持 。 ”,"On the contrary, he emphasized the three meetings between Jeong-eun Kim and Moon Jae-in, the South Korean President over the past five months and said, ""If the other side of denuclearization is South Korea, but not North Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will not become so deadlocked. """
10133,中国宣布，自2018年11月1日起，降低1585个税目的进口关税。,"China announced that it will reduce import tariffs on 1,585 tax items from November 1, 2018."
10134,今年以来，中国已接连主动降低进口关税。,"Since this year, China has taken the initiative to reduce import tariffs."
10135,今年5月1日药品全面降税，将包括抗癌药品在内的所有普通药品和具有抗癌作用的生物碱类药品、有实际进口的中成药等共28个税目的进口关税调整为零。,"On May 1 this year, the drug was fully tax-deducted, and all import tariffs for all 28 tax items of general taxable drugs, including anticancer drugs, and alkaloid drugs with anticancer effects, and Chinese patent medicines with actual imports, were adjusted to zero."
10136,同时，还较大幅度降低了抗癌药品生产、进口环节增值税税负。,"At the same time, it has also greatly reduced the production and import links value-added tax burden of anti-cancer drugs."
10137,7月1日对218个税目的汽车及零部件降税。,"On July 1, tax reductions were imposed on 218 tax items of cars and parts."
10138,降税后，中国汽车整车税率已低于发展中国家的平均水平，符合中国汽车产业实际。,"After the tax reduction, the finished automobile tax rate of China’s automobile has been lower than the average level of developing countries, which is in line with the actual situation of China’s automobile industry."
10139,这次降税将推动行业结构调整和资源优化配置，加速优胜劣汰，有助于提高产品和服务的质量，有望在一定程度上推动汽车价格调整，让消费者得到更多实惠。,"This tax reduction will drive the restructuring of the industry and the optimal allocation of resources, accelerate the survival of the fittest to help improve the quality of products and services. It is expected to promote the adjustment of automobile prices to a certain extent, so that consumers can get more benefits."
10140,7月1日对1449个税目的日用消费品降税。,"On July 1, tax reductions were imposed on 1449 tax items of daily consumer goods."
10141,日用消费品降税与人民的美好生活需要息息相关。,The tax reduction on daily consumer goods is closely bound up with people’s need of better lives.
10142,此次降税不仅数量多而且力度大，平均降税幅度达56 % 。,"This time’s tax reduction not only involves lots of items but also has strong dynamics, with an average tax reduction of 56%."
10143,日用消费品降税，直接让广大消费者受益，并促进国内产业提高竞争力。,The reduction of taxes on daily consumer goods directly benefits the consumers and promotes the competitiveness of domestic industries.
10144,11月1日将对1585个税目的机电设备、零部件及原材料等工业品实施降税。,"November 1, tax reductions will be imposed on 1585 industrial product tax items of electromechanical devices, parts and raw materials."
10145,适当降低部分国内亟需的工业品的进口关税，能够吸引更多的外资，有利于增加国内有效供给，助力产业升级，同时有助于企业在全球范围内配置资源，降低生产成本，也有利于减少国内环境承载的压力。,"Appropriately reducing the import tariffs of some domestically industrial products with urgent needs can attract more foreign capital, help increase domestic effective supply, assist industrial upgrading, and contribute to enterprises allocate resources on a global scale, reduce production costs, and also benefit for reducing the pressure on the domestic environment."
10146,中国国务院关税税则委员会办公室有关负责人介绍，以上四次自主降税，以及今年7月1日根据信息技术协议扩大范围谈判成果实施的第三步降税，将使中国的关税总水平由上年的9.8%降至7.5 % 。,Relevant person in charge of Customs Tariff Commissions Office of the State Council introduced that the above four times initiative tax reduction and the third step tax reduction implemented on this year’s July 1 in accordance with the results of the expansion of the information technology agreement negotiation will result in the overall tariff level fell from last year’s 9.8% to 7.5%.
10147,调整后的关税总水平略高于欧盟，低于大多数发展中国家，处于中等偏低水平，与中国发展中国家地位和发展阶段基本匹配。,"The adjusted overall tariff level is slightly higher than that of the EU, lower than most developing countries, at a moderately low level, and basically matches China’s developing country status and development stage."
10148,负责人介绍，关税总水平作为中国货物贸易领域开放程度的重要指标之一，应与中国经济发展阶段相适应，体现时代特征。,"According to the person in charge, as one of the important indicators of the degree of openness in China’s trade in goods sector, the overall level of tariffs should be compatible with the stage of China’s economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times."
10149,中国货物贸易规模全球第一，已经具备了进一步扩大开放的经济基础，但贸易发展质量和效益与发达经济体相比尚有差距，因此，应适当降低关税总水平。,"China’s trade in goods scale ranks first in the world, and it has already had the economic foundation to further expand its openness. However, there is still a gap between the quality and efficiency of trade development compared with developed economies. Therefore, the overall level of tariffs should be appropriately lowered."
10150,关税是合规的保护手段，关税水平应与产业竞争力相适应，要鼓励良性竞争，过度保护不利于产业发展和提高质量。,Tariff is a kind of protect means for compliance. The level of tariff should be compatible with industrial competitiveness to encourage healthy competition. While overprotection goes against the industry development and quality improvement.
10151,关税税率调整要兼顾生产需要和消费需求。,Tariff rate adjustment must balance production needs with consumer demands.
10152,重点降低国内需求较大、有助于产业转型升级的商品税率，努力增加人民群众需求比较集中的特色优势产品进口，不断增强企业和公众获得感，满足产业结构和消费结构的升级需要。,"Focus on reducing the commodity tax rate that has a large domestic demand and contributes to the transformation and upgrading of the industry, and striving to increase the import of characteristic advantage products with relatively concentrated needs of the people, continuously improving the sense of gain of enterprises and the public, and meeting the upgrading needs of the industrial structure and consumption structure."
10153,降税力度要兼顾财政收入和产业发展的可承受能力。,The tax reduction should balance the financial revenue and the affordability of industrial development.
10154,在具体降税商品和降税幅度的选择上要统筹协调好国内外两个市场、上下游两个方面、生产和消费两个关系，维护中国经济稳中向好的发展势头。,"In the choice of specific tax-reduction commodities and range of tax reductions, we must plan and coordinate the domestic and international markets, the upstream and downstream aspects, production and consumption relationship, and maintain the steady development of China’s economy."
10155,负责人强调，今年是改革开放40周年，中国主动降低进口关税总水平是根据中国自身实现高质量发展需要作出的重大举措，有利于统筹利用国际国外两种资源，促进国内供给体系质量提升，满足人民群众消费升级需要。,The principal stressed that this year is the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up. China’s initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs is a major measure based on China’s own needs to achieve high-quality development. It is conducive to the overall planning and utilization of international and foreign resources to promote the quality of domestic supply systems and meet the upgrading consumption needs of people.
10156,这一行动和举措表明中国将坚定不移奉行互利共赢的开放战略，坚定支持经济全球化，坚决维护自由贸易原则和以WTO为核心的多边贸易体系，继续从向世界开放中汲取发展动力，也让中国发展更好惠及世界。,"This action and measure shows tfhat China will constantly pursue an opening up strategy of mutual benefit and win-win result, firmly support economic globalization, steadfastly uphold the principle of free trade rule and the multilateral trading system centered on the WTO, and continue to draw development momentum from opening up to the world to also allow China’s development to better benefit the world."
10157,塞尔维亚宣布进入最高战备状态 塞俄总统将于明天会晤讨论科索沃局势,Serbia announced to enter the top defense readiness condition. Serbian President and Russian President will meet to discuss the situation in Kosovo tomorrow.
10158,南通社援引塞尔维亚总统办公厅的消息称，鉴于科索沃特种部队占领了位于科索沃北部由贝尔格莱德方面控制的加齐沃达水电站蓄水湖的通道，塞尔维亚总统武契奇下令该国武装力量进入最高战备状态。,"Yugoslav news agency reported by quoting sources from the Office of Serbian President that Vucic, the Serbian President, gave orders that the Serbian armed forces entered the top defense readiness condition in consideration of the fact that Kosovo special troops had occupied the roadway to the accumulation lake of Gazivoda hydropower station under the control of Belgrade in northern Kosovo."
10159,9月29日塞尔维亚国防部部长武林宣称，塞尔维亚军队已进入全面战备状态。,"On September 29, Vulin, the Defense Minister of Serbia, announced that the Serbian army entered the overall defense readiness condition."
10160,武林强调，只要武契奇发布的命令仍然有效，塞尔维亚就会继续保持对当前科索沃局势的监控，无论事态往哪个方向发展，塞军都将做出回应。,"Vulin emphasized that Serbia would continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo as long as Vucic's orders were still effective. Regardless of the direction in which the situation develops, the Serbian army will respond accordingly."
10161,据俄罗斯塔斯社报道，9月29日，武契奇在接受采访时表示，他已经和美俄欧等各方通报了当前局势，并将于10月2日前往莫斯科与俄罗斯总统普京会晤，在科索沃问题上寻求普京的支持。,"It was reported by the Tass news agency of Russia that Vucic said in an interview on September 29 that he had notified the United States, Russia, Europe and other sides about the current situation, and would visit Moscow on October 2 to meet with Putin, the President of Russia, to seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue."
10162,当被问及塞尔维亚是否需要像叙利亚一样获得俄罗斯的军事支持时，武契奇给予否定的回答 ： “ 我不希望在我们的领土上发生重大的军事冲突 。 ”,"When he was asked whether Serbia needed to get the military support from Russia like Syria, Vucic gave a negative answer: ""I don't want a significant military conflict in our territory. """
10163,武契奇还表示，塞军进入全面战备状态只是为了形成一种威慑，以阻止冲突的发生，但这也是一种明确的警告：绝对不会容忍在科索沃发生任何暴力行为。,"Vucic also said that the Serbian army entered the overall defense readiness condition just for the sake of deterrence to prevent the conflict. However, it was a clear warning: Serbia would never tolerate any violent action in Kosovo."
10164,塞军之所以提升战备状态，与科索沃方面的两大举动有关。,The Serbian army upgraded the defense readiness condition in connection with the two actions in Kosovo.
10165,按照塞尔维亚方面的说法，近日来，阿尔巴尼亚人正在科索沃北部地区大肆逮捕世代居住在该地的塞尔维亚族人，而这些被逮捕的塞族人没有触犯任何法律。,"According to the statement of Serbia, the Albanian people were carrying out the mass arrests of Serbian people, who had been living there for generations, in recent days, but these arrested Serbian people didn't break any laws."
10166,武契奇称，从今年3月26日塞尔维亚政府科索沃和梅托希亚办公室负责人马科・尤里奇遭科索沃阿军殴打和扣押以来，阿族不断升级地区事态，对塞族人进行毫无人道的逮捕和驱离。,"Vucic said that since Marko Juric, the head of the Serbian government's Office for Kosovo and Metohija, was beaten and detained by the Albanian army in Kosovo, the Albanian people constantly escalated the issues in the region and carried out the inhumane arrests and deportations of the Serbian people."
10167,此外，日前自行宣布成立的科索沃共和国内务部ROSU特种部队、武装警察和狙击手在内的100多人占领了加齐沃达水电站蓄水湖附近的阵地，进入到科索沃地区北部堤坝附近的生态和体育中心，并封锁了附近所有道路，而这些地区本来由塞尔维亚方面控制。,"Furthermore, over 100 people, including the members of ROSU special army of the Department of the Interior of the self-declared Republic of Kosovo, armed police, and snipers, occupied the battle field near the accumulation lake of Gazivoda hydropower station, entered the ecological sport center near the dam in northern Kosovo, and blocked all roads nearby. These areas were originally under the control of Serbia."
10168,武契奇指出，科索沃的这一军事冒险行动，是在西方国家的怂恿下做出的，科索沃军队的举动事先并没有通知塞尔维亚方面，违反了 《布鲁塞尔协议》第九章第一款，也违反了联合国安理会第1244号决议和塞科之间的军事技术协定。,"Vucic indicated that Kosovo was encouraged by the western countries to make this military adventure. Since the Kosovo army had taken actions without notifying Serbia in advance, it violated the rules in Paragraph 1 in Chapter 9 of ""Brussels Agreement"", and it also breached the UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and the military technology agreement between Serbia and Kosovo."
10169,武契奇已经向北约秘书长斯托尔滕贝格喊话，批评西方国家在科索沃问题上的虚伪言辞。,"Vucic had spoken to Stoltenberg, the NATO Secretary-General, to criticize the western countries for their false words on the Kosovo issue."
10170,当下这番冲突的根源仍旧是科索沃地区塞阿两族之间数百年的历史恩怨。,The source of current conflict was still the historical grievances lasting for hundreds of years between Serbian people and Albanian people in Kosovo.
10171,关于科索沃的归属，塞族和阿族各有各的说法。,"For the ownership of Kosovo, Serbian people and Albanian people had different opinions."
10172,塞尔维亚视科索沃为民族的发祥地和文化摇篮，因为塞尔维亚在12世纪就在这里建立了自己最强盛的国家，而阿族人只是在奥斯曼帝国入侵和塞军败退北方后才大量迁入的。,"Serbia considered Kosovo as the birthplace of its nation and the cradle of culture, because Serbia had built its most powerful country here in the 12th century. However, the Albanian people settled here in large numbers only after the Ottoman Empire invaded and the Serbian army retreated to the north."
10173,阿族人则坚持认为，公元前4-5世纪在科索沃居住的原始部落伊利里亚人是阿族人的祖先，因此，科索沃自古以来就是阿族的领土。,"The Albanian people insisted that the Illyrian people of the primitive tribe located at Kosovo in the 4th-5th century were their ancestors. Therefore, Kosovo had been the Albanian people's territory since ancient times."
10174,主观的政治划分造成不同民族、宗教和文化的激烈冲突，造成了科索沃地区塞族和阿族激烈的对立。,"The subjective political divisions contributed to the sharp conflicts between different nations, religions and cultures, resulting in the fierce confrontation between Serbian people and Albanian people in Kosovo."
10175,1912年，科索沃阿族人首先宣布了阿尔巴尼亚的独立。,The Albanian people in Kosovo first declared the independence of Albania in 1912.
10176,第一次世界大战以后，居住在巴尔干半岛的大批阿族人迁往土耳其，塞族人比重相对上升，在塞族人看来 “只是拿回属于自己的土地”的做法，却被阿族人视作 “大塞尔维亚主义”的掠夺，两族矛盾激化。,"After the First World War, a large number of Albanian people, who were living in the Balkan Peninsula, moved to Turkey. The proportion of Serbian people was relatively rising. The actions of ""taking back their own lands"" in the sight of the Serbian people were considered as the predations of the ""Greater Serbian Nationalism"" by Albanian people. The contradiction between the two nations intensified."
10177,科索沃成为了巴尔干的 “火药桶 ” 。,"Kosovo became the ""powder keg"" of Balkan."
10178,1999年，科索沃解放军中的阿尔巴尼亚分离主义者与塞尔维亚军队和警察发生武装冲突，导致北约军队对塞尔维亚和黑山组成的南联盟进行轰炸，科索沃战争爆发。,"The Albanian separatists in Kosovo liberation army and the Serbian army and police engaged in armed conflicts in 1999, which led to the NATO troops bombed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia consisting of Serbia and Montenegro. The Kosovo War broke out."
10179,2008年2月17日，科索沃单方面宣布脱离塞尔维亚独立。,"Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia on February 17, 2008."
10180,此后虽有消息传出塞尔维亚将与科索沃关系正常化，并签署全球性和具有法律约束力的协议，但由于历史民族恩怨和地缘政治掣肘，受制于美欧俄等多方力量的协议并未能够签订。,"Thereafter, the news came out that Serbia and Kosovo would normalize relations, and sign a global and legally binding agreement. However, due to the historical grievances between the two nations and the geopolitical constraints, they failed to sign the agreement, which was in the control of different forces, including the United States, Europe and Russia."
10181,而就在一个月前，武契奇首次明确表示主张将科索沃境内的塞族与阿族隔离，再次将两族矛盾公开化。,"Just a month ago, Vucic made it clear for the first time that he insisted to separate Serbian people from Albanian people in Kosovo. It exposed the conflict between the two nations again."
10182,电力通讯仍中断 印尼强震伴海啸救援困难重重,Power Communication Still in interruption. Difficulties in Rescue due to Strong Earthquakes with Tsunami in Indonesia.
10183,据印尼救灾署30日凌晨公布的数字，28日发生在该国中苏拉威西省栋加拉县的强烈地震及引发的海啸，已造成420人死亡。,"According to figures released by the National Disaster Mitigation Agency on the morning of the 30th, a devastating earthquake and the caused tsunami in the Donggala Regency in Central Sulawesi caused 420 people on 28th."
10184,印尼救灾署负责人WilemRampangilei称，该数字仅是距震中约80公里的中苏拉威西省府帕卢市的初步统计，因为缺乏大型搜救机械，该市许多因地震倒塌损毁的酒店、商场、仓库等人员密集建筑尚未搜救。,"Wilem Rampangilei, head of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, said that the figure is only preliminary statistics from the Palu in Central Sulawesi, about 80 kilometers from the epicenter. Because of the lack of large-scale search and rescue machinery, many damaged and collapsed hotels, shopping malls, warehouses and other densely populated buildings due to the earthquake have not been searched and rescued."
10185,当地时间2018年9月29日，印度尼西亚巴路，一座被地震和海啸破坏的桥梁坍塌断成数节。,"On September 29, 2018, in Palu, Indonesia, a bridge damaged by the earthquake and tsunami collapsed into several sections."
10186,因电力和通讯设施遭严重破坏，震中栋加拉县和邻近的西吉地区至今仍然是联系不上的“孤岛 ” ， 无法统计遇难者人数。,"Due to the severe damage to power and communication facilities, the epicenter of Donggala Regency and the neighboring Sigi area are still “lonely islands"" that cannot be reached, and the number of victims cannot be counted."
10187,此间媒体报道，印尼副总统卡拉称死亡人数或达数千人。,"According to media reports here, Indonesian Vice President Kalla said the death toll may reach thousands."
10188,电力中断、通讯中断、道路阻断、机场受损 … … 强震及海啸后的救援工作困难重重。,"Power interruption, communication interruption, road blockage, airport damage... The rescue work after strong earthquakes and tsunami is very difficult."
10189,由于电力中断，帕卢市一些医院和救援安置点需靠燃油发电。,"Due to power interruption, some hospitals and rescue settlements in Palu rely on fuel for power generation."
10190,而进出该市的道路因山体滑坡被阻断，包括油罐车在内的大型运输车辆无法进入，使得燃油供应十分紧张。,"The roads entering and leaving the city are blocked due to landslides, and large transport vehicles, including tank trucks, are unable to enter, which makes the fuel supply very tight."
10191,印尼社会部长阿古斯表示，因道路损坏，该部从邻近震区的南苏拉威西省和哥伦打洛省调运的帐篷、床垫、毛毯、衣服、食品、家庭用品包等紧急救灾物资尚未运抵灾区。,"Indonesian Minister of Social Affairs, Agus said that due to road damage, the Ministry dispatched emergency relief materials such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothes, food and household goods packages from Central Sulawesi and Gorontalo adjacent to the earthquake region have not arrived in the disaster area."
10192,从首都雅加达调运的救灾物质正通过空军运输机运往灾区。,The disaster relief materials transported from the capital Jakarta are being transported to the disaster area through the air transport aircraft.
10193,鉴于帕卢机场指挥塔台和跑道在地震中受损，为确保安全和保障救援，已停飞一切商业航班，仅供运送救援物资和人员的军用飞机起降。,"In view of the damage to thecontrol tower and runways of the Palu Airport during the earthquake, all commercial flights have been grounded to ensure the safety and security of the rescue. The airport is only used for the take-off and landing of military aircraft carrying relief supplies and personnel."
10194,在震区指挥救援的印尼政治、法律和安全事务统筹部长维兰托要求尽快恢复电力供应和机场商业航班服务，以保证医院等救援机构运转，让更多救援人员和志愿者、援助物资能够运抵灾区。,"Wiranto, the Indonesian Coordinating Ministry for Political, Legal and Security Affairs, who directed the rescue in the earthquake zone, demanded that the power supply and airport commercial flights be restored as soon as possible to ensure the operating of hospitals and other relief agencies, so that more rescuers, volunteers and aids can be transported to disaster areas."
10195,28日印尼中苏拉威西省栋加拉县连续发生多次强烈地震，其中当地时间17时02分发生的7.7级强震引发海啸，造成帕卢市、栋加拉县、西吉地区发生重大灾情。,"On the 28th, several strong earthquakes occurred in Donggala Regency in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia continuously. The 7.7-magnitude earthquake that occurred at 17:02 local time caused a tsunami, which caused Palu City, Donggala Regency and Sigi area occurred major disasters."
10196,中新社北京10月1日电 (记者 尹力)碧空如洗、晴空万里、彩霞满天 … … 近日，北京持续开启最美蓝天模式，引得万千京城民众在社交平台上花式秀图，在持续刷屏中晒幸福感，称“蓝天白云下 ， ‘ 醉’美天际线，这才是北京最好的名片 ” 。,"China News Service, Beijing, October 1 (reported by Yin Li) -- A cloudless blue sky in the day and the red clouds at evening......Recently, Beijing kept in the mode of the most beautiful blue sky.

10200,有网友表示，这样的“风光大片儿”就是北京最好的城市宣传片；还有网友调侃说，如果这样的蓝天长期刷屏，有颈椎病的人都能治好了；更有网友希望“这抹蓝能越冬迎春度夏，让京城的天幕四季湛蓝 ” 。,"Some net friends said that such ""landscape pictures"" were the best city images of Beijing; and some net friends joked that if the blue sky remain the same for a long time, the patients with cervical spondylosis would surely be cured; some net friends even hoped that ""the blue sky would last through the winter, spring and summer, providing Beijing with a blue sky across four seasons""."
10201,为何京城民众格外爱晒蓝天？,Why did the residents in Beijing particularly like to show the blue sky?
10202,只因过去生活在这座城市的人们饱受雾霾之苦，由此格外渴盼蓝天，而在北京打响“蓝天保卫战 ” ， 持续改善空气质量后，雾霾变少，蓝天增多，民众看在眼里喜在心上，获得的幸福感也是格外有份量。,"That's because they had been suffering from the fog and haze in this city in the past. They looked forward to the blue sky eagerly. After starting the ""Blue Sky Protection Campaign"" in Beijing to continuously improve the air quality, there were less fog and haze, but more blue skies. The residents were joyful to see this. And they felt so happy with it."
10203,国庆节当日，北京天气晴好。,The weather was fine in Beijing on National Day.
10204,早8时，全市35个空气质量监测站点绝大多数显示为“一级优”的绿色。,"Most of 35 air quality monitoring stations in Beijing showed in green at 8:00 am, indicating the ""Superior First Grade""."
10205,社交平台上由民众自发的“最蓝天空”主题摄影大赛还在持续中。,"The photography competition with the theme of the ""bluest sky"" voluntarily organized by the residents on social platforms was still under way."
10206,近期北京的天为何这么蓝？,Why was the sky so blue in Beijing recently?
10207,据北京市环境保护局相关负责人介绍，今年8月，北京的细颗粒物(PM2.5)平均浓度为35微克/立方米，创下近5年来的历史同期最佳纪录。,"As the relevant responsible person of Beijing Environmental Protection Agency explained, the mean concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was 35 micrograms per cubic meter in Beijing in August of this year, which created the best record for the same period in history of the recent five years."
10208,9月间的PM2.5实时浓度更是频现个位数。,The real-time concentration of PM2.5 was even less than 10 in September.
10209,出现“最蓝天空”的一大因素在于近段时间气象条件总体有利，更重要的是，北京持之以恒地开展大气污染治理，近五年来大力推进清洁空气行动计划，环境效益持续释放，使得区域内污染物排放总量减少，这些都为空气质量持续改善奠定了基础。,"The major factor contributing to the ""bluest sky"" was the overall favorable meteorological conditions in recent days. And more importantly, Beijing had persistently carried out the air pollution control. It had vigorously promoted the Clean Air Action Plan in the past five years, and the environmental benefits were released continuously resulting in the reduction of total pollutant emission in the region. These laid the foundation for continuous improvement of air quality."
10210,北京于2013年正式发布并实施《北京市2013-2017年清洁空气行动计划 》 。,"Beijing released officially and implemented the ""2013-2017 Clean Air Action Plan in Beijing"" in 2013."
10211,根据该计划，官方持续引导非首都功能疏解，推进能源清洁化替代和污染减排工作，共计淘汰燃煤锅炉4923家。,"According to this plan, the authority would continue to guide the alleviation of functions unrelated to its status as national capital, and promoted the works of clean energy substitutions and pollutants discharge reductions. 4923 coal fired boilers were eliminated in total."
10212,北京由此也成为中国内地首个实现全网天然气化的大城市。,"Thus, Beijing became the first big city of achieving the full network of natural gasification in the Chinese mainland."
10213,数据显示，2013年至2017年间，北京的PM2.5年均浓度累计降幅达35.6 % ； 空气质量达标天数增加了50天；一级优天数增加了25天；重污染天数共减少35天，重污染发生率明显降低。,"According to the data, the annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing from 2013 to 2017 cumulatively dropped by 35.6%; the number of days that the air quality reached the standards increased by 50; the number of days that achieved the Superior First Grade increased by 25; the number of days with heavy pollution reduced by 35 in total, and the occurrence rate of heavy pollution significantly dropped."
10214,在空气质量持续改善的同时，北京官方依据新一轮PM2.5来源解析，于今年9月发布《北京市打赢蓝天保卫战三年行动计划 》 ， 针对目前的治理阶段和污染特征，聚焦柴油货车、扬尘、挥发性有机物治理等重点防治领域，优化调整运输结构、产业结构、能源结构和用地结构，强化区域联防联控，着力加强城市精细化管理，全面推动绿色发展，力争让“最蓝天空”常驻京城，不再“物以稀为贵 ” ， 让其回归为人们相册中的背景而不是主角。,"With the continuous improvement of air quality, Beijing authority issued the ""Three-year Action Plan of Beijing to Win the Blue Sky Protection Campaign"" in September on the basis of the analysis of a new round of PM2.5 source. According to the current governance phase and pollution characteristics, it focused on the important prevention and control areas including the treatment of diesel trucks, flying dusts, and volatile organic compounds, optimized and adjusted the transportation structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land-use structure, strengthened the inter-regional prevention and control, enhanced the delicacy management of city, promoted the green development in an all-round way, and strived to keep the ""bluest sky"" permanently in Beijing. The sky would not ""be precious"", since it was rare. Let it return to be the background of people's photo album, but not the leading role."
10215,今年国庆黄金周期间，市旅游委、工商、城管、公安等相关部门将加强对“一日游”市场的执法检查，聚焦旅游“六黑”乱象，违法违规者一经查实，将依法给予从重从严叠加处罚。,"During this year’s National Day Golden Week, the Municipal Tourism Commission, Industry and Commerce Bureau, City Urban Administrative and Law Enforcement Bureau, Public Security Bureau and other relevant departments will strengthen the law enforcement inspection of the ""one-day tour"" market, focusing on the ""six unlicensed"" chaos in tourism, and once verified, the violations will be imposed on strict and serious punishment according to the law."
10216,昨天上午，市政府召开严打非法“一日游”专题会，对进一步严打非法“一日游”的专项行动作出部署。,"Yesterday morning, the municipal government held a thematic meeting on illegal ""one-day tour"" to deploy a special action to further crack down on illegal ""one-day tour""."
10217,会上透露，聚焦黑票提、黑导、黑社、黑车、黑店、黑网利益链条相互交织的“六黑”乱象，本市自7月28日启动了严打非法“一日游”专项行动。,"At the meeting, the focus was on the ""six unlicensed"" chaos that was intertwined with the unlicensed ticket provider, unlicensed tour guide, unlicensed travel agency, unlicensed car, tourist trap and unlicensed website profit chain. The city launched a special action for ""one-day tour"" on July 28th."
10218,专项行动开展至今，全市共受理“一日游”投诉39件，同比下降63 % ； 今年以来，全市受理“一日游”投诉270件，同比下降62 % 。,"Since the launch of the special action, the city has accepted 39 ""one-day tour"" complaints with a year on year decrease of 63%. Since the beginning of this year, the city has accepted 270 ""one-day tour"" complaints with a year on year decrease of 62%."
10219,近两个月以来，全市查扣“黑车”248台，查处旅游客运业务违章158起，关闭购物“黑店”和演艺场所29家，查处“黑社”13家 、 “ 黑导”27人，没收非法广告2.6万张，拆除非法“一日游”广告牌31块、公交假站牌3块，查处各类涉旅违法行为1789起，各职能部门立案181起，从重罚款448万元，拘留涉旅违法人员111人。,"In the past two months, the city has checked and detained 248 ""unlicensed cars"", investigated and handled 158 violations of the tourist transportation business, shut down 29 shopping ""tourist traps"" and performing arts venues, investigated and handled 13 ""unlicensed travel agencies"" and 27 ""unlicensed tour guides"", confiscated 26,000 pieces of illegal advertisements, torn down 31 pieces of illegal ""one-day tour"" billboards and 3 pieces of fake bus stop signs, investigated and handled 1789 various types of travel-related violations, and 181 cases were filed by various functional departments with a heavier fine of 4.48 million yuan and 111 travel-related illegal criminals were detained."
10220,经过整治，非法“一日游”乱象基本得到遏制 ， “ 一日游”市场秩序呈现稳中向好的态势。,"After rectification, the illegal ""one-day tour"" chaos has been basically contained, and the ""one-day tour"" market order has shown a steady and good trend."
10221,据介绍，近年来本市不断加大对非法“一日游”的整治力度。,"According to the information, the city has continuously strengthen the force of illegal ""one-day tour rectification in recent years."
10222,2016年和2017年，市旅游委受理“一日游”投诉1612件和897件，同比分别减少79%和44 % ， 但非法“一日游”仍然屡打不绝、时常反弹，并形成了黑票提、黑导、黑社、黑车、黑店、黑网等利益链条相互交织的“六黑”乱象。,"In 2016 and 2017, the Municipal Tourism Commission accepted 1,612 complaints and 897 complaints of ""one-day tour"", a year-on-year decrease of 79% and 44% respectively. Though the crack down actions are contentiously implemented, the illegal ""one-day tours"" are still recurrent, forming the intertwined profit chains among the ""six unlicensed"" chaos of unlicensed ticket provider, unlicensed tour guide, unlicensed travel agency, unlicensed car, tourist trap and unlicensed website."
10223,具体而言，街头非法揽客人员即“黑票提 ” ， 发布虚假旅游信息的不法网站即“黑网 ” ， 从事非法“一日游”的旅行社或无旅行社经营资质的机构或个人即“黑社 ” ， “黑社”雇用的无导游证或违规执业的导游即“黑导 ” ， 其使用的无旅游客运资质的车辆或为非法“一日游”提供客运服务的有旅游客运资质的车辆即“黑车 ” ， 最终他们将游客带入的指定旅游购物店即“黑店 ” 。,"Specifically, ""unlicensed ticket provider"" is the person who attract customers on the street illegally, ""unlicensed website"" is the illegal website providing fake tourism information, ""unlicensed travel agency"" engaged in illegal ""one-day tour"" or an institution without business qualification of travel agencies, ""unlicensed tour guide"" is the tour guide without tourist certificate or practice illegally and employed by the ""unlicensed travel agency"", ""unlicensed car"" is the vehicle without tourist transportation qualification used by ""unlicensed tour guide"" or the vehicle with tourist transportation qualification used for providing passenger service to illegal ""one-day tour"", and last, the ""unlicensed tour guide"" will bring the tourists to the specified travel shopping store, that is ""tourist trap""."
10224,此次专项行动中，本市持续加大了对非法“一日游”的固定式检查和机动式巡查，针对非法“一日游”高发频发和影响大的旅游线路点位，相关部门每日派出暗访组上车随团暗访，发现违法违规证据后依法从严查处。,"In this special action, the city continued to increase the fixed inspection and flexible inspection of illegal ""one-day tour"". Focus on the illegal ""one-day tour"" with high frequency and influential tourist route points, the relevant departments assigned daily secret investigation teams to make investigations with the tour groups secretly, and strict investigation and treatment will be imposed according to the law, if violations are found."
10225,其中 ， “ 黑车”和“黑店”成为专项行动中两个严打的重点。,"Among them, ""unlicensed car"" and ""tourist trap"" have become the two focuses of the serious crack downs in the special action."
10226,据介绍，没有黑车，非法“一日游”就无法成行，黑车既容易被发现、记住和查处，也是单项价值较高的固定资产。,"According to reports, without ""unlicensed cars"", the illegal ""one-day tour"" can not be completed, ""unlicensed cars"" are easy to be found, remembered and investigated, they are also fixed value with a hinger single value."
10227,相关部门运用道路交通监控探头加大对重点“一日游”线路旅游大巴车的监管，用技防、物防等科技智能手段可以及时发现查处“黑车 ” 。,"Relevant departments used road traffic surveillance cameras to increase the supervision of the tourist buses along the key ""one-day tour"" routes, and use intelligence measures such as technology prevention and physical prevention to find and investigate ""unlicensed cars"" in time."
10228,旅游购物“黑店”由于数量不多、坐地经营，也成为严打重点。,"""Tourist trap"" during traveling has become a key focus due to its small number and operation in locality."
10229,为强化对非法“一日游”的震慑和打击力度，专项行动中凡一经查实违法违规的，各职能部门一律依法给予从重从严叠加处罚。,"In order to strengthen the shock and attack on illegal ""one-day tour"", all the functional departments will impose heavy and strict punishments according to law, once they have verified the violation of laws and regulations."
10230,今年8月，本市还召开了严打非法“一日游”相关法律问题研讨会，研讨了行政处罚与入刑定罪相结合的手段措施。,"In August of this year, the city also held a seminar on legal issues related to illegal ""one-day tour"", and discussed means and methods combining administrative punishment with conviction of imprisonment."
10231,市旅游委表示，今后将鼓励更多正规旅行社开展北京“一日游 ” ， 加大正规“一日游”的供给，以进一步挤占非法“一日游”的生存空间，目前具体方案还在研究中。,"The Municipal Tourism Commission said that in the future, more formal travel agencies will be encouraged to carry out Beijing ""one-day tour"" and increase the supply of formal ""one-day tour"" to further occupy the living space of illegal ""one-day tour"". The specific plan is still under study."
10232,此外，市旅游委还不断完善旅游团电子行程单信息系统，确保每个团队都纳入电子行程单平台监管。,"In addition, the Municipal Tourism Commission has continuously improved the electronic travel itinerary information system of the tour group to ensure that each group is included in the electronic itinerary platform supervision."

10245,桐乡市委书记盛勇军认为，世界互联网大会的红利随着时间推移而累积，因此，也更需要搭建一个平台，承接各方人才、项目、技术等要素的叠加导入。,"Sheng Yongjun, the municipal party secretary of Tongxiang, believes that the dividends of the World Internet Conference will accumulate over time. Therefore, it is more necessary to build a platform to undertake the superposition and import of talents, projects, technologies and other elements from all areas."
10246,桐乡人沈怡在外工作20年，因和互联网大会结缘，返乡创业。,"Shen Yi, a Tongxiang person, has been working outside for 20 years. Due to attraction of the Internet Conference, he returns home to start a business."
10247,去年12月2日，他带着高容量防篡改数字化技术解决方案，走进了第四届互联网之光博览会，受到了多个客户的青睐。,"On December 2 of last year, he participated in the fourth ""Light of the Internet"" exposition with high-capacity tamper-proof digital technology solutions, which was preferred by many customers."
10248,沈怡选择在乌镇创业不仅是因为家乡情结 ， “ 在乌镇，招人比我想象得要容易，我们的应用也落地很快，乌镇智慧停车项目里就有我们的应用 。 ”,"Shen Yi chooses to start his business in Wuzhen not only because of the hometown complex.

10249,一条乌镇大道，呈现了互联网大会的溢出效应。,A Wuzhen avenue presents the spillover effect of the Internet Conference.
10250,这条贯通桐乡南北的大道，不仅串起了旅游景点，还是一条产业大道。,"This avenue running north and south of Tongxiang, not only links up tourist attractions, but also is an industrial avenue."
10251,以它为依托，乌镇大道科创集聚区应运而生。,"Relying on this avenue, the science and innovation agglomeration area of Wuzhen avenue comes into being."
10252,记者了解到，未来，乌镇大道将成为桐乡产业发展的主阵地，率先大量应用智慧医疗、智慧养老、智慧政务等成果，集聚占全市GDP80%的产业和众多高层次人才。,"The reporter learned that the Wuzhen avenue will become the main land of industrial development of Tongxiang in the future, taking the lead in applying masses of achievements of smart medical care, smart pension, smart government affairs, etc., as well as gathering industries which account for 80% of GDP for the whole city and many high-level talents."

10263,复旦大学附属儿科医院新生儿重症监护室(NICU)主任曹云教授对记者表示，在提高早产儿存活率的同时，关注降低早产儿存活质量，降低并发症发生率，改善神经发育预后，改善患儿整体结局，对提高早产儿总体生存质量和人口素质具有重要意义，是国内外儿科界、新生儿科界关注的重要问题，同时也是本次项目关注的关键问题。,"Professor Cao Yun, the director of NICU of Children's Hospital of Fudan University told the reporter that it was of great significance for the improvement of premature infants' overall survival quality and population quality to pay attention to the reduction of premature infants' survival quality, reduce the complication rates, improve the neurodevelopmental prognosis, and improve the overall outcome of baby patients while improving the survival rate of premature infants. It was an important problem of concern to the pediatric and neonatal departments at home and abroad, and it was also a critical issue in this project."

10270,儿科医院方面透露，研究结果显示EPIQ干预两年后，早产儿感染下降35 % ， 同时抗生素使用率下降20 % 。,"According to the pediatric hospital, the research results show that after implementing the EPIQ intervention for two years, the infection rate of premature infants will drop by 35%, and the usage rate of antibiotics will drop by 20%."
10271,未来，复旦大学附属儿科医院将继续将此方法向全国范围进行推广和实施，着眼于全面降低早产儿所有并发症发生率，改善全国新生儿的救治质量。,"In the future, Children's Hospital of Fudan University will continue to promote and implement these methods in the whole country, aiming at comprehensively reducing the occurrence rates of all complications in premature infants and improving the quality of treatment for newborns in China."
10272,当下，中国各地区救治水平却存在差异和不均质性是不争的事实。,"At present, it is an indisputable fact that there are differences and inequalities in the level of treatment in various regions in China."
10273,据曹云教授介绍，作为国家儿童医学中心的重要建设单位，儿科医院将发挥引领辐射作用，本项研究覆盖新疆、贵州、甘肃、陕西等多个西部省份，以期逐步促进全国范围内新生儿救治的同质化和规范化。,"According to Professor Cao Yun's introduction, the pediatric hospital will play a leading role as an important construction unit of Children's National Medical Center.

10303,路透布鲁塞尔9月28日 - 在意大利蔑视欧盟要求，以大规模预算赤字计划让市场大感意外后，欧盟周五对意大利采取非对峙的立场，但如果意大利坚持太大胆的目标，欧盟或许会采取更为激进的立场。,"Report of Reuters on September 28 in Brussels: The European Union took a non-confrontational stance against Italy on Friday after Italy looked down upon EU demands and surprised the market with a massive budget deficit plan. But if Italy stuck to a too bold goal, the EU might take a more radical stance."

10307,政府宣布其计划后，欧元周五跌至近两周来最低水平，意大利债券收益率则触及三周来最高位。,"After the government announced its plan, the euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday, while the Italian bond yields hit their highest level in three weeks."
10308,如果赤字目标在10月最后期限前仍保持不变，欧盟执委会可能会否决意大利的预算草案，这是该执委会从未对任何国家做过的事情。,"If the deficit goal remained unchanged before the deadline in October, the European Commission might veto the Italian draft budget, which has never been done to any country by the European Commission."
10309,欧盟执委会副主席东布洛夫斯基周五后来在拉脱维亚首都里加的一个会议上称，意大利当前的财政计划“似乎与稳定与增长公约不符 ” ， 他指的是欧盟的财政规定。,"Dombrowski, the Vice-President of the European Commission said at a meeting in Riga, the capital of Latvia later on Friday that current Italian fiscal plan ""seems to be inconsistent with the Stability and Growth Convention"", which was referred to the EU fiscal provisions."

10371,中新网新疆沙雅9月30日电(耿丹丹 王小军)位于新疆沙雅县的无膜棉种植试验基地，无膜棉长势喜人，与旁边有地膜棉花相比“毫不逊色 ” ， 一簇簇雪白的棉花竞相“开放 ” ， 挂满枝头。,"China News Service, Xinjiang, Xayar, September 30 (Geng Dandan, Wang Xiaojun) - Located in the Xayar County of Xinjiang, the cotton planted in film-free cotton planting test base has a breathtaking growth. Compared with the film cotton next to it, it is not inferior in any respect. A cluster of snow-white cotton competes ""blooming"" and is full of branches."
10372,9月27日至28日，全国无膜棉现场观摩暨研讨交流活动在新疆沙雅县举行。,"From September 27 to 28, the nationwide film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange activities were held in Xayar County, Xinjiang."
10373,记者在观摩会上了解到，以“中棉619”及其配套栽培措施为主体的无膜棉技术体系，初步实现了棉田无膜化种植的目标，减少了新疆棉田残膜对生态环境和原棉的污染，无膜棉综合技术研究与示范取得重大进展。,"The reporter learned at the observation meeting that the film-free cotton technology system with ""Chinese Cotton 619"" and its supporting cultivation measures as the main body has initially achieved the goal of film-free planting in cotton fields, reducing the pollution of the Xinjiang cotton field film residue to the ecological environment and raw cotton. And film-free cotton integrated technology’s research and demonstration have achieved significant progresses."
10374,中国工程院院士、著名棉花遗传育种家、国家现代农业产业技术体系棉花体系首席科学家喻树迅院士给浙江农林大学校党委书记周国模介绍无膜棉生长情况。,"Academician Yu Shuxun, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, famous cotton genetic breeder and chief scientist of the national modern agricultural industrial technology system’s cotton system, introduced the growth of film-free cotton for Zhou Guomo, secretary of the Party Committee of Zhejiang A&amp;F University."
10375,“我们研发的无膜棉综合技术能够完全实现不用地膜种植棉花，可以彻底解决残膜污染难题，实现绿色植棉 。 ”,"""The comprehensive technology of the film-free cotton developed by us can completely realize the cotton planting without the film, and can completely solve the problem of residual film pollution and realize green cotton planting. """
10376,中国工程院院士喻树迅介绍。,"Yu Shuxun described, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering."
10377,新疆是中国最重要的产棉区，据国家统计局统计，2017年新疆棉花种植面积为3500万亩，占全国棉花面积的61 % 。,"Xinjiang is China’s most important cotton-producing region. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the cotton planting area in Xinjiang in 2017 was 35 million mu, accounting for 61% of the national cotton area."
10378,自1982年地膜引进中国以来，新疆地区各类农作物覆膜面积达5000万亩以上，地膜年使用量约30万吨左右。,"Since the introduction of mulching film in China in 1982, the filmed area of various types of crops in Xinjiang has reached more than 50 million mu, and the annual use of mulching film is about 30 million tons."
10379,其中，棉花地膜覆盖率达到100 % ， 棉田覆膜占新疆地膜使用量的60%左右。,"Among them, cotton mulching film coverage rate reached 100%, and cotton field mulching film accounted for about 60% of Xinjiang film use."
10380,无膜棉进行测产，棉产量完全可以实现亩产320公斤到350公斤。,"Use film-free cotton for production measurement, and the cotton output can be fully realized from 320 kg to 350 kg per mu."
10381,随着新疆地膜投入量的不断增加，残留地膜回收率低，土壤中残膜量逐步增加，残膜造成土壤结构破坏等一系列问题，严重影响农业可持续发展。,"With the increasing amount of mulching film input in Xinjiang, the residual film recovery rate is low, the residual film volume in the soil is gradually increased, and the soil structure damages and other problems caused by residual film seriously affects the sustainable development of agriculture."
10382,残膜不仅对土壤造成严重污染，而且对棉花纤维品质也有很大影响。,"The residual film not only causes serious pollution to the soil, but also has a great influence on the quality of cotton fiber."
10383,目前，新疆超过1/3的棉田实现了机械化采收。,"Currently, more than one-third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have achieved mechanized harvesting."
10384,2017年，新疆机采棉面积约1400万亩。,"In 2017, Xinjiang mechanized harvesting area is about 14 million mu."
10385,机采棉收获过程中收入大量地表、棉株上的碎膜，掺杂在原棉中的碎膜在原棉加工过程中难以清除，在后续纺织加工过程中也无法彻底清除，严重影响纺织产品的质量。,"In the process of cotton mechanized harvesting, a large amount of broken film on earth surface and the cotton plant are picked up. The broken film doped in the raw cotton is difficult to remove during the processing of raw cotton, and can not be completely removed in the subsequent textile processing process, seriously affecting the quality of textile products."
10386,9月28日，全国无膜棉现场观摩暨研讨交流活动在新疆沙雅县举行。,"On September 28, the nationwide film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange activities were held in Xayar County, Xinjiang."
10387,为着力解决棉田地膜污染，简化植棉技术，提高棉田效益，喻树迅带领他的团队通过8年时间，实施“中棉619”无膜棉技术种植，为新疆农业绿色发展“添翼 ” 。,"In order to solve the cotton mulching film pollution, simplify the cotton planting technology and improve the cotton field efficiency, Yu Shuxun led his team to use 8 years to implement the ""Chinese Cotton 619"" film-free cotton technology planting, adding ""advantages"" to Xinjiang’s agricultural green development."
10388,喻树迅介绍，通过创新育种新思路，培育出特早熟、耐盐碱、耐低温、丰产的陆地棉新品系“中棉619 ” 。,"Yu Shuxun introduced, with the new idea of innovative breeding, they cultivate a new line of extra early ripening, saline-alkaline tolerance, low temperature resistant, and high yield upland cotton ""Chinese Cotton 619""."
10389,“ ‘ 中棉619’在新疆南部地区无膜栽培条件下，实现了无膜播种机械配套、播种深度改进、无膜条件下滴管带浅埋、适宜播种密度筛选、合理化学调控等一系列配套措施 。 ”,""" ‘Chinese Cotton 619’ has achieved a series of supporting measures such as film-free seeding machinery, improved seeding depth, shallow buried in drip irrigation zone, suitable seeding density screening, and reasonable chemical regulation under the condition of film-free cultivation in southern Xinjiang. """
10390,目前，阿克苏、库尔勒、阿拉尔等地建立了无膜棉示范基地，每公顷产量达到4800公斤。,"At present, Aksu, Korla, Alear and other places have established a demonstration base for film-free cotton, with a yield of 4,800 kg per hectare."
10391,无膜种植棉花，实现了丰产、节本、环保，综合效益提高。,"Film-free cotton planting has achieved high yield, cost savings, environmental protection and improved overall benefits."
10392,新疆生产建设兵团第三师农科所农艺师张栋海说，通过近6年无膜棉栽培技术研究与示范，无膜棉籽棉产量完全可以实现亩产320公斤到350公斤，甚至可能更高。,"Zhang Donghai, an agronomist at the Third Division of the Agricultural Science Research Institute of Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through nearly six years of research and demonstration of film-free cotton cultivation techniques, the production of film-free cottonseed cotton can fully achieve 320 kg to 350 kg per mu, and may even be higher."
10393,“无膜棉栽培技术的推广前景很大 。 ”,"""The promotion of film-free cotton cultivation technology has great prospects. """
10394,张栋海认为，当前，无膜棉栽培技术可以彻底解决土壤残膜污染问题，但目前经济效益相比地膜栽培还有一定差距。,"Zhang Donghai believes that at present, the film-free cotton cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil residual film pollution, but there is still a certain gap between the current economic benefits and the cultivation of mulching film."
10395,“棉花收购价格的扶持将有利于今后的推广 。 ”,"""The support of cotton purchasing price will be conducive to future promotion. """
10396,喻树迅表示，下一步，他和他的团队将继续对无膜棉进行深入研究和大面积推广应用，把无膜棉这一产业做大做强，彻底解决地膜造成的土壤污染问题。,"Yu Shuxun said that in the next step, he and his team will continue to conduct in-depth research and large-scale promotion and application of the film-free cotton, making the industry of film-free cotton larger and stronger, and completely solving the problem of soil pollution caused by the film."

10466,昨天下午，北京控股足球俱乐部（下文简称北控）针对该队前外援阿尼切贝指控球队涉嫌踢假球的消息作出官方回应，北控方面发表声明表示，俱乐部方面绝对不存在任何踢假球的情况，这完全是阿尼切贝本人在仲裁过程中，为了掩盖其公然违反合同约定的事实，为了其个人的不正当经济目的而凭空捏造出的谎言。,"Yesterday afternoon, Beijing BG Football Club (hereinafter referred to as BG) made an official response to its ex-foreign aid Anichebe's accusation that it was suspected of playing match-fixing. BG declared that the club never playing any match-fixing. It was absolutely a lie fabricated out of thin air by Anichebe so that he could cover up the fact that he had brazenly breached the contract and realize his personal improper economic purpose in the course of arbitration."
10467,同时，北控表示将保留采取一切手段追究相关当事人责任的权利。,"At the same time, BG indicated that it would reserve the right to take all means to hold the relevant party accountable."
10468,据英国《每日邮报》消息，尼日利亚球员阿尼切贝向国际足联指控，他去年曾效力的北京北控队涉嫌打假球，这其中就包括2017赛季中甲第21轮的北京德比。,"According to the ""Daily Mail"" from UK, Nigerian player Anichebe reported to the FIFA that BG Team he played at last year was suspected of playing match-fixing, including the 21st Beijing Derbies of CFACL in the 2017 season."

In December of that year, Anichebe refused to return to the team to take part in the winter training without any justified reason. Although the club repeatedly urged, he still refused to return."

10474,声明中还提到，备受关注的“假球指控”其实是阿尼切贝在仲裁过程中，为了掩盖其公然违反合同约定的事实，为了其个人的不正当经济目的而凭空捏造出的谎言。,"It also declared that the high-profile ""match-fixing allegation"" was actually a lie fabricated out of thin air by Anichebe so that he could cover up the fact that he had brazenly breached the contract and realize his personal improper economic purpose in the course of arbitration."
10475,其诽谤俱乐部、诽谤中国足球的唯一目的是获取不正当的经济利益。,His sole aim of slandering the club and Chinese football was to obtain the illegitimate economic benefits.
10476,俱乐部更不接受任何组织或任何个人，为了其经济利益与私人恩怨，对俱乐部进行无端指责、诽谤、污蔑、诋毁的行为。,"The club would not accept any groundless accusations, defamation, vilification and slander made by any organization or individual due to its economic benefits and personal grudge."

10641,这条有中国特色的道路决定了中国不会也不可能重蹈国强必霸的覆辙，也决定了中国既不会成为美国，不会挑战美国，更不会取代美国。,"This road with Chinese characteristics determined that China would not or can not repeat the mistake of a strong country becoming a hegemon, and determined that China would not become another United States, or challenge the United States, or even replace the United States."

10643,“这显然是一个重大的战略误判 。 ”,"""This is obviously a major strategic misjudgment. """

10645,王毅指出，中国走的是一条和平发展之路。,Wang Yi pointed out that the road China was walking on was a road for peaceful development.
10646,中国人从来就没有对外扩张的基因。,Chinese people have never had a gene for expansion.
10647,相信各国可以和谐共处、交流互鉴。,"It was believed that all countries can live in harmony, and make exchanges and mutual learning."
10648,不管过去、现在还是将来，中国既不会照搬外国的模式，也不会要求别国复制中国的做法。,"Regardless of past, present or future, China would never copy foreign models, or require other countries to copy China's practices."
10649,稍早前王毅在纽约会见美国前国务卿基辛格时表示，中美合作就会双赢，对抗必然双输。,"Earlier, when Wang Yi met with Kissinger, the former U.S. Secretary of State, in New York, he said that China-U.S. cooperation would be win-win and the confrontation would be necessarily lose-lose."
10650,中方始终致力于发展长期健康稳定的中美关系，实现不冲突不对抗、相互尊重、合作共赢。,"The Chinese side was always committed to developing the long-term, healthy and stable China-U.S. relation and achieving no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation."

10667,印尼副总统卡拉表示，一些地区的电力和通讯被切断导致信息不畅通，这次地震和海啸造成的死亡人数最后可能升至数千人。,"Kalla, the Vice President of Indonesia, said that the electricity and communication in some places were cut off, so the information was blocked.

10701,路透华盛顿/墨西哥9月28日 - 墨西哥周五称，经过数日的争论，美国总统特朗普的政府和加拿大正在做出切实努力以求解决贸易政策分歧，令外界憧憬北美自由贸易协定(NAFTA)有望维持三方协定形式。,"Report of Reuters on September 28 in Washington/Mexico: Mexico said on Friday that after days of debates, the U.S. President Trump's government and Canada were making real efforts to resolve trade policy differences, raising hopes that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would maintain the form of a tripartite agreement."
10702,虽然缺乏细节，但上述明显的进展足以促使墨西哥和美国政府突然停止公布两方贸易协定文本的计划，给加拿大更多时间来加入协定。,"Despite lack of details, the obvious progress mentioned above is enough to prompt the Mexican and American governments to abruptly stop publishing the text of the two-party trade agreement and give Canada more time to join the agreement."
10703,墨西哥候任总统奥夫拉多尔(Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador)在墨西哥对记者表示，美国政府已对加拿大政府提出新的反建议，并称他将继续力促三个国家都参与NAFTA。,"Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the Mexican president-elect, told the reporters in Mexico that the U.S. government had made new counter-proposals to the Canadian government and said he would continue to urge these three countries to participate in NAFTA."
10704,墨西哥经济部长瓜哈尔多(Ildefonso Guajardo)称，将美墨两方贸易协定文本提交给墨西哥和美国立法的时间被推迟，因加拿大和美国政府“非常认真地”尝试达成协议。,"Ildefonso Guajardo, the Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs, said the time for submitting the text of the US-Mexico trade agreement to the legislation departments of Mexico and the United States had been delayed because the Canadian and American governments tried to reach an agreement ""very seriously""."
10705,瓜哈尔多称 ， “ 在未来48小时内，我们将知道我们是达成一份三方协定文本，还是不得不公布两方协定文本 。 ”,"Guajardo said, ""In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we will get a text of a tripartite agreement or have to publish the text of the two-party agreement. """
10706,瓜哈尔多说，他的美国和加拿大同级官员“特别要求”推迟发布该文本。,"Guajardo said that the officials at the same level in the U.S. and Canada had ""special requests"" to postpone to publish the text."
10707,美国贸易代表办公室(USTR)的发言人未就美墨两方贸易协定文本及美国与加拿大的磋商置评。,The spokesman of the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) did not comment on the text of the bilateral trade agreement between the United States and Mexico and the negotiations between the United States and Canada.

10709,"据外媒报道，南非首都比勒陀利亚郊区的一处保育中心里，两只小狮子一起嬉闹玩耍，很难看出有任何异常之处,不过它们其实绝无仅有。","According to foreign media reports, it was hard for people to find anything unusual in two little lions playing in a conservation center located in the suburb in Pretoria, the capital of South Africa, but they were absolutely unique."
10710,比勒陀利亚大学宣布 ： “ 这是历来首见以人工授精方式诞生的幼狮 ― ― 全世界的第一对 。 ”,"University of Pretoria announced: ""They are the first lions in the history, which are born by artificial insemination -- the first pair of lions in the world. """
10711,校内科学家正致力研究母非洲狮的生殖系统。,The scientists of the university were committing themselves to studying the reproductive system of female African lions.
10712,比勒陀利亚大学哺乳动物研究所主任甘斯温特表示，8月25日出生的这两只幼狮一雌一雄，相当健康，也很正常。,"Ganswindt, the director of Mammal Institute of University of Pretoria, said that these two little lions born on August 25 were a female lion and a male lion. They were pretty healthy and quite normal."
10713,他的团队经过18个月的密集试验，终于达成此项突破。,"After the intensive tests in 18 months, his team finally made this breakthrough."
10714,甘斯温特接受媒体访问时表示 ： “ 我们从一头健康雄狮身上采集精子 。 ”,"Ganswindt said in a media interview: ""We collected the sperms from a healthy male lion. """
10715,接下来，研究人员等母狮体内的荷尔蒙含量达到合适程度时，为它进行人工授精。,"Next, the researchers waited for the hormones in the female lion to reach a proper level so as to conduct the artificial insemination in it."
10716,甘斯温特表示 ： “ 幸运的是，结果成功 。 ”,"Ganswindt said: ""Fortunately, the result turned out to be successful. """
10717,他说，研究人员“进行数次尝试，但出乎意料的是，并未花费太多力气 ” 。,"He said that the researchers ""tried many times, but to their surprise, it didn't take much effort""."
10718,他表示，前述研究突破可重复验证，科学家们希望能利用此技术挽救濒临绝种的大型猫科动物。,"He said that the above-mentioned research breakthrough could be verified repeatedly, and the scientists hoped to use this technology to save the endangered big cats."
10719,国际自然保育联盟指出，狮子已在非洲26国绝种，幸存的野生狮子总数在过去20年内锐减43 % ， 约仅剩2万头。,"The International Union for Conservation of Nature indicated that the lion had already become extinct in 26 African countries, and the total number of survival wild lions had declined sharply by 43% in the past 20 years with only about 20,000 wild lions left."
10720,非洲狮被这个组织列为易危动物。,The African lion was listed as vulnerable by this organization.
10721,甘斯温特说 ： “ 我们若不为这种动物做点事情，它们就会面临绝种 。 ”,"Ganswindt said: ""This animal will be in danger of extinction if we do nothing for them. """
10722,他表示，这种新技术无须让狮子接受饲养，而是只要将精子注入可受孕的母狮体内，就像北美和欧洲对圈养大象所采取的作法一样。,"He said that with this kind of new technology, it's not necessary for the lions to be fed. The sperms could be injected into the bodies of female lions, just like the approach adopting on the elephants in captivity in North America and Europe."
10723,韩国9月出口降幅为逾两年来最大，但分析师把下滑归咎于工作天数较少，并称尽管中美贸易紧张情势升高，全球对韩国商品的需求仍强劲。,"The exports of South Korea fell the most in more than two years in September, but analysts put the blame of the decline on fewer working days and said that although the trade tension between China and the United States rose, the global demand for South Korean goods remained strong."
10724,的确，韩国上个月日均出口增加。,"Indeed, the average daily exports of South Korea increased last month."
10725,此外，稍早公布的初值数据显示，在长假期前的9月头几周的出口有两位数增长。,"Moreover, the initial value data released earlier showed that the exports in first weeks of September during the long vacation had a double-digit increase."
10726,韩国9月出口同比降幅为2016年7月以来最大，降幅大于路透调查11位分析师所得预估的下滑5.7 % 。,"The year-on-year drop of South Korean exports in September was the largest since July 2016, which was more than the decrease of 5.7% estimated by 11 analysts of Reuters surveys."
10727,周一公布的初值显示，9月出口额为506亿美元，低于8月的512亿美元。,"The initial value released on Monday showed that the amount of exports in September was $50.6 billion, lower than $51.2 billion in August."
10728,尽管忧心不断加剧的美中贸易争端可能导致其他依赖出口的中国邻国也遭殃，但韩国9月对中国出口增长7.8 % ， 连续第23个月扩张。,"Although the China-US trade disputes with intensifying concerns might cause other neighboring countries of China which depended on exports to suffer, Korean exports to China in September increased by 7.8%, expanding for the 23rd consecutive month."
10729,韩国对美出口则下滑11.8 % ， 因石油产品销售下滑。,"Since the sales of oil products declined, Korean exports to America decreased by 11.8%."
10730,韩国记忆体芯片及石油产品海外销售分别增长28.3%和13.5 % ， 尽管市场忧心所谓芯片“超级周期”可能已经见顶。,"Although the market worried that the so-called ""supercycle"" of chips might reach the peak, the overseas sales of Korean memory chips and oil products increased by 28.3% and 13.5% respectively."
10731,“不过，贸易冲突影响将难以避免，因为韩国的出口相当大程度地依赖美国和中国市场 。 ”,"""However, the influence of trade conflicts cannot be avoided, because Korean exports considerably depend on American and Chinese markets. """
10732,进口下滑2.1%至408亿美元，也不如路透调查预估的增长3.1 % 。,"The imports decreased by 2.1% to $40.8 billion, inferior to the increase of 3.1% estimated by the Reuters survey."
10733,9月贸易盈余初值为97亿美元，高于8月的69亿美元。,"The initial value of trade surplus in September was $9.7 billion, higher than $6.9 billion in August."
10734,产业部称，拜美国与欧盟国家之赐，全球制造业将保持畅旺，这对于韩国出口是一个有利因素。,"The Department of Industry said that thanks to America and the EU countries, the global manufacturing would maintain buoyant, which was a favorable factor for Korean exports."
10735,声明指出 ， “ 油价上涨造成的出口价格提高，也将对今年下半年出口有利 。 ”,"The statement pointed out, ""the increasing export price caused by the rise of the oil price will be beneficial to the exports in the second half of this year. """
10736,“不过美国与中国间的贸易冲突延续，再加上美国升息之后市场波动加剧，都是出口面临的负面压力 。 ”,"""However, the trade conflict between the United States and China continues and the market fluctuation after rising U.S. interest rates intensifies, which are both negative pressure on exports. """
10737,9月平均每个工作日的出口增至26亿美元，8月时为21亿美元。,"The average exports of each working day in September increased to $2.6 billion, while the amount in August was $2.1 billion."
10738,韩国今年中秋节落在9月24-26日，因此9月只有19.5个工作天，较去年同期少了四天。,"The Mid-Autumn Festival in South Korea this year was from September 24-26 so that there were only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than the same period last year."
10739,韩国1-9月出口较去年同期成长4.7 % 。,The Korean exports from January to September increased by 4.7% compared with that of the same period last year.
10740,根据日经/Markit采购经理人指数，韩国制造业活动在9月回升，但是受到国内订单支撑，因为来自中国和日本的订单下滑，这恐将另出口前景笼罩阴霾。,"According to the Nikkei/Markit Purchasing Managers Index, activities of Korean manufacturing rose again in September which was supported by domestic orders, since Chinese and Japanese orders declined, which would probably cast a shadow over export prospects."
10741,朝鲜媒体批评美国不放松对朝制裁,North Korean media criticized the United States for not easing the sanctions on North Korea.
10742,朝鲜《劳动新闻》９月３０日刊发署名评论文章，批评美国在寻求与朝对话的同时却不放松对朝制裁，称这是“自相矛盾”的做法。,"North Korea's ""Rodong Shinmun"" published a signatured review article on September 30 to criticize the United States for not easing the sanctions on North Korea while seeking to have a dialogue with North Korea. The article said that it was a ""self-contradictory"" action."
10743,文章说，美国国务卿蓬佩奥１４日称“为实现朝鲜半岛无核化，关键是履行对朝制裁 ” ， 强调美国继续履行联合国制裁决议的立场不变。,"The article said that Pompeo, the United States Secretary of State, indicated on September 14 that ""the key to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was to impose the sanctions on North Korea"" to emphasize that the United States would keep its position on implementing the UN resolution to impose sanctions."
10744,在新加坡朝美联合声明中，双方承诺要建立与朝美两国人民期待和平繁荣的愿望相适应的新的朝美关系。,"In the North Korea-US Joint Statement of Singapore, the two sides promised to build a new North Korea-US relation, which complied with the two peoples' wishes of looking forward to peace and prosperity."
10745,美国一面加大制裁打压力度，一面要求对话，这样的做法无疑是自相矛盾的。,"On one side, the United States increased the intensity of sanctions, but on the other side, it asked for the dialogue. Undoubtedly, its actions were self-contradictory."
10746,文章说，如果要建立新的朝美关系、在朝鲜半岛构筑永久巩固的和平体制、实现朝鲜半岛完全无核化，就应将构筑信任摆在首位，从可以做的事情开始，逐一分阶段解决。,"According to the article, if it wanted to build a new North Korea-US relation, establish a permanently consolidated system of peace in the Korean Peninsula, and achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it would put building trust in the first place, start from what can be done, and solve the problems by stages."
10747,文章还说，美国应明白，制裁打压对朝鲜行不通。,The article also said that the United States should understand that it wouldn't work to impose sanctions on North Korea.
10748,文章说，即便是“喀山”号之前的“北德文斯克”号也让美军赞叹。,"The article said that even the ""Severodvinsk"" preceded the ""Kazan"" was admired by the U.S. military."
10749,《国家利益》杂志援引美海军观点称 ： “ 我们将遇到强大潜在对手。只看看‘北德文斯克’号潜艇就够了 。 ”,"The National Interest quotes the view of US Navy as saying, ""we will encounter a strong potential opponent. It is enough to see the ""Severodvinsk"" submarine only. """
10750,美军现任驻欧海军总司令福戈也对“北德文斯克”号潜艇赞誉有加。,"Foggo, the current commander in chief of the U.S. navy in Europe, also highly praised the ""Severodvinsk"" submarine."
10751,他说 ： “ 这艘潜艇令人印象深刻。看看俄罗斯海军的发展、如何使用资源就会知道，其在研究和发展方面所做的主要努力首先是强化潜艇舰队 。 ”,"He said, ""this submarine is impressive. Look at the development of Russian navy and how they utilize resources and it will be known that their main efforts on the fields of research and development are firstly to strenghten the submarine fleet. """
10752,但《国家利益》杂志仍认为美国在这一领域保持着对俄罗斯的优势。,"However, the National Interest still considers the United States maintains the advantage against Russia in this field."
10753,福戈说 ： “ 我相信，西方国家仍有不对称优势 。 ”,"Foggo said, ""I believe that western countries still have asymmetrical advantages. """
10754,此前有消息称俄海军将于2019年列装“喀山”号潜艇。,"Previously, it was informed that the Russian navy would equip the ""Kazan"" submarine in 2019."
10755,“喀山”号 、 “ 新西伯利亚”号 、 “ 克拉斯诺亚尔斯克”号 、 “ 阿尔汉格尔斯克”号多用途潜艇均为“白蜡树-M”改进型，排水量为13800吨，下潜深度520米，人员编制64人，水下航速31节，将携带水雷、鱼雷和“口径”及“缟玛瑙”巡航导弹。,"The multipurpose submarines of ""Kazan"", ""Novosibirsk"", ""Krasnoyarsk"" and ""Arkhangelsk"" are all of ""Fraxinus-M"" improved type, with displacement of 13,800 tons, depth of 520 m, staffing of 64, submerged speed of 31 knots. All the submarines will carry mines, torpedoes and ""Kalibr"" and ""Onyx"" cruise missiles."

10775,无视美国威胁！,Ignore the Threat of America!
10776,欧盟或将与伊朗达成原油采购协议,EU may Reach Crude Oil Purchase Agreement with Iran
10777,美国政府日前宣称，11月将重启对伊朗的新一轮制裁，甚至敦促其他国家减少对伊朗石油的进口。,The US government announced that it will restart a new round of sanctions against Iran in November and even urge other countries to reduce imports of Iran oil.
10778,不过，美国的盟友们似乎没有听进去。,"However, the American allies did not seem to take the advice."
10779,据美国《纽约时报》报道，29日，伊朗外交部长扎里夫受访时透露，尽管美国威胁将制裁任何与伊朗做生意的国家，德黑兰正与欧盟接近达成一项关于原油出售的协议。,"According to the US ""New York Times"", on 29th, during the interview, Zarif, Foreign Minister of Iran, revealed that although the United States threatened to sanction any country that does business with Iran, Tehran is approaching to reach an agreement on the sale of crude oil with EU."
10780,这份协议核心目的是试图建立一个新的支付机制，即以易货或本币的计价方式，来取代美元交易。,"The core purpose of this agreement is to try to establish a new payment mechanism, which is to replace the dollar transaction in the form of barter or domestic currency."
10781,该方法的目的是希望绕过美国，并防止美国阻碍财务转移。,The purpose of this approach is to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from impeding financial transfers.
10782,与此同时，虽然欧盟正致力于该协议的促成，但一些法国和英国的官员也有所担忧，如果协议得以实现，这将是反对美国退出伊核协议的欧盟与美国之间最为公开的对抗。,"Meanwhile, although the EU is working on facilitating the agreement, some French and British officials are also worried that if the agreement is concluded, it will be the most overt confrontation between the EU and the United States against the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal."
10783,美媒称，在一个小时里专访中，扎里夫的言语听起来比最近几个月都要更乐观。,"The US media said that in the one hour interview , Zarif’s words sounded more optimistic than in recent months."
10784,因为该协议有能力“剥离”美国的传统盟友，有效打破美方试图削减伊朗收入的行为。,"Because the agreement can ""strip"" the traditional American allies and effectively break the US’s attempts to cut Iran’s income."
10785,“这样能确保我们出售石油并获益 ” ， 扎里夫认为，根据2015年达成的协议，各国拥有与伊朗进行贸易往来的合法权利。,"""This can guarantee that we can sell oil and obtain benefits"", Zarif believed. According to the agreement reached in 2015, each country has the legal rights to make trade contacts with Iran."
10786,欧盟外交政策负责人费代丽卡・莫盖里尼日前也表示 ， “ 任何主权国家或组织都不能接受其他人来决定，自己可以和谁进行贸易往来 。 ”,"The head of Union for Foreign Affairs Policy, Federica Mogherini, also said recently that ""no sovereign state or organization can accept other people to decide who they can trade with. """
10787,不过，她也预言，在美国政府于11月展开下一步制裁前，美国领导人有可能采取一系列金融手段，旨在针对与德黑兰有商业往来的银行、商人和国家。,"However, she also predicted that before the US government carried out the next step of sanctions in November, US leaders could adopt a series of financial instruments aimed at banks, businessmen and countries that have commercial intercourses with Tehran."
10788,今年5月，美国政府以协议有缺陷为由，单方面宣布退出伊核协议，并称该协议无法永久禁止伊朗生产核燃料。,"In May of this year, the US government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal on the grounds that the agreement had deficiencies, saying that the agreement could not permanently prohibit Iran from producing nuclear fuel."
10789,美方随后威胁要禁止那些购买伊朗石油及其他商品的公司在美国开展业务。,The US then threatened to ban companies that buy Iran oil and other commodities from doing business in the United States.
10790,这一威胁致使部分公司撤离德黑兰，伊朗货币暴跌。,This threat forced some companies to leave Tehran and made the Iranian currency dropped sharply.
10791,空中客车公司和法国石油巨头道达尔等企业已经取消了数十亿美元的对伊投资。,Companies such as Airbus S.A.S. and French oil giant Total have cancelled billions of dollars in investment in Iran.
10792,英国和法国官员曾表示，美国政府可能会“占上风 ” 。,"British and French officials said, the US government may ""take the lead""."
10793,果不其然，根据近日土耳其媒体的一篇报道，美方的制裁似乎并未对伊朗的石油出口造成很大影响。,"Unsurprisingly, according to a recent report by the Turkish media, the US sanctions did not seem to have a major impact on Iran’s oil exports."
10794,伊朗石油部长赞加内日前透露，除韩国以外没有其他国家停止购买伊朗石油。,"Recently, Iran Oil Minister Zanganeh disclosed that no country other than South Korea has stopped buying Iran oil."

10843,“小胖墩”背后的健康隐患不容忽视。,"The health hazard behind the ""chubby children"" couldn't be ignored."
10844,中国疾病预防控制中心营养与健康所所长丁钢强表示，超重肥胖危害青少年正常生长发育，对其心理、行为、认知和智力产生不良影响，甚至会导致儿童高血压、高血糖、高血脂。,"Ding Gangqiang, the head of National Institute for Nutrition and Health of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that overweight-obesity could harm the adolescents' normal growth and development, have a negative impact on their mentality, behavior, cognition and intelligence, and even cause hypertension, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in children."
10845,同时，青少年超重肥胖易延续至成年期，将增加青少年成年后患高血压、糖尿病等慢性疾病的风险。,"And the adolescents' overweight-obesity might continue into adulthood, which would increase the adolescents' risk of having chronic diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes in their adulthood."

10850,对于这种单纯性的肥胖，应注重科学的运动加上合理的饮食控制。,"For this kind of simple obesity, we should lay emphasis on scientific movement and reasonable diet control."
10851,张漓指出，保持健康体重，最重要的理念是“治未病 ” ， 其中很重要的一环是对学校、家长和学生进行全方位的科普教育，普及超重与肥胖的危害，提高青少年的防范意识。,"Zhang Li pointed out that the most important concept to maintain a healthy weight was the ""preventive treatment of disease"", and an integral part of it was to conduct the all-round science popularization education of schools, parents and students, popularize the dangers of overweight and obesity, and increase the adolescents' self-protection awareness."
10852,青少年应定期体检，监测身高体重等生长发育指标，及早发现、科学判断是否出现超重和肥胖问题，以便及时采取干预措施。,"The adolescents should take the periodic physical examination to monitor the growth and development index, such as height and weight, so that the problems of overweight and obesity could be discovered early and determined scientifically to take intervention measures in time."
10853,对于已经超重肥胖的青少年，丁钢强建议，除主动科学地安排膳食与运动外，青少年处于特殊的生理阶段，应避免使用饥饿或半饥饿疗法来控制和减轻体重，切不可盲目服用减肥药品。,"For those adolescents who are already overweight and obese, Ding Gangqiang advised that starvation therapy or semi-starvation therapy should be avoided to control and lose weight in addition to the active and scientific arrangement of diet and movement since the adolescents are in a special physiological stage. They should not take drugs blindly to lose weight."

10878,中新社宜昌10月1日电 (郭晓莹 刘敏)新修订的《三峡-葛洲坝水利枢纽通航调度规程 》 ( 以下简称《调度规程 》 ) 于10月1日起正式开始执行，三峡升船机在试通航两年后，正式与船闸统一调度。,"China News Service, Yichang, October 1 (reported by Guo Xiaoying and Liu Min) -- The newly revised ""Three Gorges-Gezhouba Hydro Project Navigation Scheduling Regulation"" (hereinafter referred to as ""Scheduling Regulation"") was officially enforced starting from October 1. After two years of navigation test, the Three Gorges ship lift was officially scheduled together with the navigation lock in a unified way."
10879,新规执行首日，三峡-葛洲坝水域通航秩序良好。,"On the first day of enforcing the new regulations, the navigation in Three Gorges-Gezhouba waters was in good order."
10880,长江三峡通航管理局于9月30日21时发布首个安检计划，并对160艘船舶进行安检，共有124艘船舶安检合格。,"Three Gorges Navigation Authority released the first plan of security check at 21:00 on September 30, and carried out the security check on 160 ships, with 124 ships passing the security check."
10881,10月1日14时，通航部门安排了新规执行后的首个过闸计划。,"The navigation authority arranged the first locking plan after the enforcement of new regulations at 14:00 on October, 1."
10882,新规执行后，安检计划每日9时和21时各发布一次，过坝计划每日14时和20时各发布一次，便于船舶灵活安排过坝计划。,"After the enforcement of new regulations, the plan of security check would be released once every day at 9:00 and 21:00, and the plan of passing dam would be released once every day at 14:00 and 20:00, so that the ships could flexibly arrange the plan of passing dam."
10883,《调度规程》增加了“分类控制”的船舶过坝调度原则，根据船闸及升船机功能定位分别明确过坝船舶优先顺序，将过闸的短线客船调整为与示范船和诚信船同一优先等级。,"The ""Classification Control"" scheduling principle of ship passing dam was added in the ""Scheduling Regulation"". The priority of ship passing dam would be determined according to the functional localization of navigation lock and ship lift respectively. The short-term passenger ship passing dam would be adjusted to be in the same priority as the demonstration ship and integrity ship."
10884,这也是升船机试运行两周年后，正式与船闸统一调度。,This is also the official scheduling of ship lift and navigation lock after the two-year navigation test of ship lift.
10885,而川江及三峡库区大长宽示范船、新能源动力船也首次跻身优先等级。,It was also the first time for big length-width demonstration ship and new energy driven ship of Chuanjiang River and Three Gorges Reservoir Region to be ranked in the priority.
10886,同时 ， 《 调度规程》将“通航调度管理水域”由之前180公里近坝水域调整为云阳长江大桥至石首长江大桥541.8公里水域，并划分“核心水域、近坝水域、控制水域、调度水域 ” 。,"At the same time, the ""navigation scheduling management waters"" were adjusted from the 180-kilometer waters close to dam to the 541.8-kilometer waters from Yunyang Yangtze River Bridge to Shishou Yangtze River Bridge in the ""Scheduling Regulation"". And the ""core waters"", ""water close to dam"", ""control waters"" and ""scheduling waters"" were divided."
10887,此举有利于船方选择适宜水域待闸，减少坝区待闸船舶的积压。,"This action would help the ship choose the proper waters to wait for crossing the lock, avoiding excessive ships waiting for crossing the lock in the dam region."
10888,《调度规程》还根据现行船舶过坝、待闸特点，提出了对违规行为的船舶取消申报、过坝延迟24小时过坝等诚信制约措施。,"The ""Scheduling Regulation"" also put forward the measures of integrity constraint for the rule-breaking ships according to the current characteristics of ship passing dam and waiting for crossing lock, such as canceling the declaration and delaying the time of passing dam for 24 hours."
10889,三峡蓄水后，库区通航条件得到了改善，促进了长江航运的快速发展。,"After water storing of the Three Gorges, the navigation condition of the reservoir area was improved, accelerating the rapid development of shipping in Yangtze River."
10890,数据显示，三峡船闸及葛洲坝船闸年货物通过量由2004年的3430万吨分别增长到2017年的1.38亿吨和1.4亿吨。,"According to data, the annual cargo throughput of Three Gorges ship lock and Gezhouba ship lock was increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 0.138 billion tons and 0.14 billion tons in 2017 respectively."
10891,三峡升船机试通航两年来通过船舶5767艘次、旅客16.22万人次、货运量达171.28万吨。,"During the two-year navigation test of ship lift, 5767 ships and 0.1622 million people have passed, and the volume of goods transported was 1.7128 million tons."
10892,三峡通航管理局副局长陈冬元表示 ， 《 调度规程》对推动诚信过闸管理，维护两坝枢纽通航秩序，疏解坝区船舶待闸压力，提升通航能力有积极作用。,"Chen Dongyuan, the deputy director of Three Gorges Navigation Authority, said that the ""Scheduling Regulation"" played an active role in promoting the management of crossing lock in an honest way, relieving the pressure of ships waiting for crossing the lock in the dam region, and improving the navigation capacity."

10938,路透名古屋11月5日 - 日本央行总裁黑田东彦周一表示，该央行意识到长期实施超宽松货币政策可能挤压金融机构利润率，并可能破坏该国银行系统的稳定。,"Report of Reuters on November 5 in Nagoya: Haruhiko Kuroda, the president of the Bank of Japan said on Monday that the bank realized that the long-term implementation of ultra-easing monetary policy could squeeze the profit margins of financial institutions and destabilize the banking system of Japan."
10939,但他表示，鉴于通胀低迷及海外经济体充满不确定性，日本央行需要维持其大规模刺激计划，同时密切关注其政策的利弊。,"However, he said that due to the low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the Bank of Japan needed to maintain its large-scale incentive plans and pay close attention to the pros and cons of its policies."
10940,“日本央行完全承认，在持续的货币宽松之下，金融机构的实力将受到越来越大的影响 ， ” 黑田东彦在名古屋对企业领袖的演讲中表示。,"""The Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that under the sustained monetary easing policy, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected,"" Haruhiko Kuroda said in a speech to the business leaders in Nagoya."
10941,他称，如果金融机构更积极承接风险，以弥补多年来低利率造成利润率缩窄的影响，一旦出现严重的负面冲击，银行体系有可能出现动荡。,"He said that if financial institutions were more active in taking risks to compensate for the effect of low interest rates on shrinking profit margins over the years, the banking system could be unstable in the event of serious negative impacts."
10942,“尽管目前来看这些风险并不大 ，但央行将密切关注形势发展，鼓励金融机构采取必要的措施 ， ” 他称。,"""Although these risks are not too big at present, the Bank of Japan will closely monitor the development of the situation and encourage financial institutions to take necessary measures,"" he said."

10945,会议记录显示，另一名委员称，鉴于政策持续期间有其局限，委员会应讨论日本央行可以将刺激政策维持多久。,"The minutes showed that another member of the board said that due to the limits of policy duration, the committee should discuss how long the Bank of Japan can maintain the incentive policy."
10946,黑田东彦称，日本央行将评估宽松政策带来的金融风险，同时还需考虑围绕日本经济前景的不确定性，因中美贸易摩擦和日益抬头的保护主义，可能影响全球需求。,"Haruhiko Kuroda said that the Bank of Japan would assess the financial risks brought by the easing policy, and take into account the uncertainties centered on Japan's economic prospects, as China-U.S. trade frictions and rising protectionism might affect the global demand."
10947,“此类问题对日本经济的影响暂时是有限的 ， ” 黑田东彦称。,"""The impact of such problems on Japan's economy is temporarily limited,"" Haruhiko Kuroda said."
10948,“但如何问题持续，对日本经济的影响则可能变大 ， ” 他补充说。,"""But if the problem persists, the impact on Japan's economy may increase,"" he added."
10949,“有必要持续地进行强有力的货币宽松政策，同时以一种平衡的方式考虑积极和消极影响 ， ” 黑田东彦说。,"""It is necessary to sustain the strong monetary easing policy and consider both positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner,"" Haruhiko Kuroda said."
10950,尽管激进刺激计划的弊端增多，譬如长期低利率侵蚀金融机构的获利，但通胀低迷却迫使日本央行维持该计划。,"Although the disadvantages of radical incentive plans were increasing, such as long-term low interest rates eroding the profits of financial institutions, the low inflation forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the plan."
10951,日本央行上月维持货币政策；面对全球贸易战争端带来的风险，黑田东彦排除了近期升息的可能性。,The Bank of Japan maintained the monetary policy last month; Haruhiko Kuroda ruled out the possibility of recent interest rate increase about the risks brought by the conflict of the global trade war.

11063,为保障救援，28日晚开始关闭的帕卢机场29日晚重新开放后停飞一切商业航班，记者当晚已办好登机牌从雅加达飞往帕卢的航班被取消。,"In order to guarantee the rescue, Palu Airport, which was closed on the evening of the 28th, was reopened on the 29th. After the reopening, all the commercial flights were grounding of aircraft. The reporter finished the boarding pass, however, the flight from Djakarta to Palu was cancelled."
11064,地震及海啸发生后，中国驻印尼大使馆即通过各种渠道了解核实灾区中国公民情况。,"After the earthquake and tsunami, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia learned through various channels to verify the situation of Chinese citizens in the disaster area."
11065,截至目前，尚未收到中国公民伤亡的报告。,"As of now, there is no report of casualties of Chinese citizens has been received."
11066,"俄罗斯茹科夫斯基中央空气流体动力学研究院院长瑟帕洛说 ： "" 超音速项目正按国际集团计划以及与工贸部签署的合同进行。""","Serparo, the president of the Central Academy of Aerodynamics in Zhukovski, Russia, said, ""the supersonic project is being carried out according to the international group plan and the contract signed with the Ministry of Industry and Trade."""
11067,我们认为需要2到3年才能进行技术演示，另外还需要10到15年实现民用飞机量产 。,"We think it will take two to three years to demonstrate the technology, and another 10 to 15 years to achieve mass production of civil aircrafts."
11068,瑟帕洛说，目前俄科学家面临的问题是如何使飞机的经济性和安全性得到兼顾。,Serparo said that the current problem that the Russian scientists face was how to make the aircraft economical and safe.
11069,他说，超音速飞机的特点是巨大噪音影响。,He said that supersonic aircrafts are characterized by loud noise effects.
11070,瑟帕洛表示，该研究院正在与莫斯科航空学院和图波列夫设计局共同研发全系列民用超音速飞机，其中包括用于商业运输的公务机和大型客机。,"Serparo said that the academy was working with the Moscow Aviation Institute and the Tupolev Design Bureau to research and develop whole series of civil supersonic aircrafts, including business aircrafts and large passenger aircrafts for commercial transport."
11071,习近平总书记在民营企业座谈会上发表十分重要的讲话，为民营经济走向更加广阔的舞台注入坚定信心。,"General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a very important speech at the private sector symposium, injecting a firm confidence into the broader stage of the private economy."
11072,习近平总书记强调“让企业家卸下思想包袱，轻装前进”在广大企业家和创新创业者中引发强烈共鸣。,"General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that ""letting entrepreneurs unload their mental loads and march with light packs"", which has a strong resonance among entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs."
11073,市场活力来自于人，特别是来自于企业家，来自于企业家精神。,"Market vitality comes from people, especially from entrepreneurs, from entrepreneurship."
11074,在改革开放40年波澜壮阔的历程中，有千千万万个企业家创业创新的故事，企业家群体的成长壮大，不断推动着中国经济的破浪前行。,"In the magnificent course of the 40 years of reform and opening up, there are thousands of entrepreneurs entrepreneurship and innovation stories, the growth and expansion of entrepreneurs-group constantly push the Chinese economy to sail far."
11075,一段时间以来，社会上有的人发表了一些否定、怀疑民营经济的言论。,"For some time, some people in the society have published some remarks that negate and doubt the private economy."
11076,所谓“民营经济离场论 ” “ 新公私合营论”等错误说法引起一些企业家的疑虑和担忧。,"The so-called ""private economic departure theory"" and ""new public-private partnership theory"" and other misconceptions have caused some entrepreneurs’ doubts and concerns."
11077,近来，一些民营企业在经营发展中遇到不少困难和问题。,"Recently, some private enterprise have encountered many difficulties and problems in their business development."
11078,比如，国际经济环境变化给一些出口企业带来影响；需求结构快速调整带来转型升级压力；有些政策相互不协调，政策效应同向叠加，或者是工作方式简单，导致一些初衷是好的政策产生了相反的作用等等。,"For example, the changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some export enterprises; the rapid adjustment of the demand structure has brought about the pressure of transformation and upgrading; some policies are not coordinated with each other, the policy effects are superimposed in the same direction, or the working methods are simple, resulting in some policies with good original intentions have the opposite effect, etc."
11079,种种因素交织，民营经济遇到困难，一些民营企业经营面临困境，企业家表现出不少焦虑。,"All kinds of factors are intertwined, the private economy is facing difficulties, some private enterprises are facing difficulties, and entrepreneurs show a lot of anxiety."
11080,在这个背景下，纠正认识上的误区，卸下企业家的思想包袱，让企业一心一意谋发展，政府一心一意促发展，事关市场信心和发展预期，有着尤为深刻的现实意义。,"Under this context, it is particularly profound and practical to correct the cognition errors, let the entrepreneurs’ unload the mental load, let them develop wholeheartedly, make the government promote development devotedly and concern market confidence and development expectations."
11081,这次座谈会上再次强调了“三个没有变”的重要论断 ： “ 非公有制经济在我国经济社会发展中的地位和作用没有变！”,"This symposium once again emphasized the important assertion of the ""Three no-changes"": ""There is no change in the role and function of non-public sector in our economic and social development""!"
11082,从深入推进简政放权、建立权力清单制度到营造保护企业家合法权益的法治环境，打造公平竞争的市场环境，塑造全社会尊重企业家的氛围，近年来，党中央对企业家的重视程度、制度保障力度空前。,"In recent years, from deepening the promotion of streamline administration and delegate more power to lower-level governments, establishing a power list system, and creating a legal environment that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, creating a market environment of fair competition and shaping the atmosphere of respecting entrepreneurs in the whole society, the Party Central Committee has attached unprecedented emphasis on entrepreneurs and institutional guarantees."
11083,此次座谈会更是明确提出大力支持民营企业发展壮大6个方面的政策举措，推出一系列致力于民营企业“轻装前进”的务实行动。,"The symposium clearly stated the six aspects’ policy measures to vigorously support the development and expansion of private enterprises, and launched a series of pragmatic actions dedicated to the ""march with light packs"" of private enterprises."
11084,这些都给企业家群体极大鼓舞，给社会各界更多期待。,These actions have greatly encouraged the entrepreneurial community and have given more expectations to the community.
11085,迷雾拨开，方针已定，关键在于落实。,"The fog has been set aside, and the policy has been set. And the key aspect lies in implementation."
11086,要不断为民营经济营造更好发展环境，帮助民营企业解决发展中的困难，助力实现中国经济转型升级；要让企业家在市场竞争中感到公平，在合法经营中感到安全，在社会生活中感到尊重，激发创新活力和创造潜力。,"We must continue to create a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises solve the difficulties in development, and help achieve China’s economic transformation and upgrading; let entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legal operations, and feel respected in social life, stimulate innovation and create potential."
11087,中国经济进入迈向高质量发展的进程，需要更多企业家施展抱负，也为企业家发挥创造力提供了更大的空间和舞台。,"The Chinese economy has stepped into a process of moving towards high-quality development, requiring more entrepreneurs to display their ambitions and providing more spaces and stages for entrepreneurs to exert their creativity."
11088,我们有理由相信，随着进一步深化改革、破除障碍，民营经济将迎来更好的发展前景和发展机遇，走向更加广阔的舞台。,"We have reason to believe that with further deepening reforms and removing obstacles, the private economy will greet better development prospects and opportunities and move toward a broader stage."
11089,内蒙古进出口环节46种监管证全部实现联网核查 -中新网,46 types of import and export supervision licenses in Inner Mongolia have all been verified online - China News
11090,中新网呼和浩特11月5日电 (记者 李爱平)呼和浩特海关5日消息称，即日起，除保密需要等特殊情况外，当地进出口环节46种监管证全部实现联网核查。,"Report on November 5 in Inner Mongolia of China News (reported by Li Aiping): the Hohhot Customs said on November 5 that 46 types of local import and export supervision licenses were verified online from that day, except for confidentiality requirements and other special circumstances."
11091,内蒙古企业可采用无纸方式向海关申报相关证件，避免了以往现场奔波、纸质申请、重复提交等问题。,"The enterprises in Inner Mongolia can declare relevant documents to the Customs in paperless way, so as to avoid the problems of rushing around on site, paper application, repeated submission, etc."
11092,据了解，单证准备时间指报关申报之前对进出口环节所需各类单证的准备时间，是影响整体通关时间的一项主要因素，要想压缩通关时间、降低通关费用，必须减单证。,"It was known that the preparation time of documents referred to the preparation time of various types of documents required for import and export before declaration, which was a major factor that affected the overall clearance time. In order to compress the clearance time and reduce the clearance costs, the documents must be reduced."
11093,此前在进出口环节需要海关验核的各种监管证件达86种，涉及19个部门。,"Previously, there were 86 types of supervision documents in the import and export process which required customs examination, involving 19 departments."
11094,据悉，此次按照“能取消的取消，能合并的合并，能退出口岸验核的退出口岸验核”的原则，依托国际贸易“单一窗口”平台，海关与其他16家发证机关系统对接和数据互联，实现了数据多跑路、企业少跑腿。,"It was reported that according to the principle of ""to cancel what can be canceled, to merge what can be merged and to withdraw what can be withdrawn from port inspection"" this time and relying on the international trade ""single window"" platform, the Customs and other 16 license-issuing authority systems made docking and data interconnection, to achieve more data flows and less enterprise errands."
11095,海关方面称，以往企业需来回往返有关部门现场办事大厅递交纸质申请，流程漫长且无法实时跟踪审核状态。,"The customs said that in the past, enterprises had to go back and forth to the onsite office hall of the relevant authorities to submit paper applications. The process was long and it was impossible to track the verification status in real time."
11096,现在企业用户可直接登录“单一窗口”门户网站，进行线上申请。,"Now the enterprise users can directly log into the ""single window"" portal to apply online."
11097,发证部门审核通过后，将证书电子数据传输到海关，并在通关环节实现与海关报关数据的自动比对、智能验核，审核结果统一通过“单一窗口”反馈给企业，实现了监管证件申报、审核、通关和反馈的全流程网上办理。,"Upon approval of the license-issuing authority, the electronic data of the certificate would be transmitted to the Customs, and automatic comparison and intelligent examination of the Customs declaration data would be done in the Customs clearance process. All the examination results would be sent back to the enterprise through the ""single window"", which can make the whole process of declaration, examination, customs clearance and feedback of supervision documents complete online."

11099,韩参鸡汤对华出口4年间猛增20倍 分析：与空巢青年增多有关,Exports of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China surged 20 times in four years; analysis: it is related to the increase of empty-nest youth
11100,韩联社5日报道称，去年韩国参鸡汤对华出口额超过10万美元，较4年前的2013年，猛增约20倍。,"According to the report on Day 5 of Yonhap, last year, the export sales of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China exceeded 100,000 US dollars, which surged 20 times compared with that of four years ago, in 2013."
11101,分析认为，这一增势与中国空巢青年增多带动方便食品热销，以及年轻人对营养餐的关注提升有关。,"The analysis suggests that this growth is related to the hot sales of convenience food driven by the increasing number of empty-nest youth in China, as well as the increasing attention of young people on nutritious meals."
11102,该数据由韩国农水产食品流通公社(aT)5日公布。,This data is published by the Korea Agro-Fisheries &amp; Food Trade Corp (aT) on Day 5.

11104,分析认为，韩国参鸡汤在华销售增加，与空巢青年增多带动方便食品热销，以及年轻人对营养餐的关注提升有关。,"The analysis suggests that the increasing sales of Korean ginseng chicken soup in China are related to the hot sales of convenience food driven by the increasing number of empty-nest youth in China, as well as the increasing attention of young people on nutritious meals."
11105,截至今年，中国一人户家庭突破2亿大关，预计2020年将增至总人口的30 % ， 当地食品企业也纷纷瞄准“独饭族”推出各种方便食品。,"By the end of this year, the number of one-person households in China have exceeded 200 million, and it is expected to increase to 30% of the total population by 2020. Local food enterprises are also aiming at the “eating-alone people"" and launching various convenience food."
11106,另外，分析还表示，禽流感是阻碍参鸡汤扎根中国大陆市场的最大因素。,"Moreover, the analysis also indicates that bird flu is the biggest factor which prevents ginseng chicken soup from taking root in the Chinese mainland market."
11107,aT称，2016年11月到去年4月韩国出现禽流感疫情，有关部门全面禁止参鸡汤对华出口，导致出口额剧减。,aT says that bird flu outbroke in South Korea from November 2016 to April of last year. Relevant departments comprehensively ban the export of ginseng chicken soup to China which leads to sharp reduction of export sales.
11108,2016年参鸡汤对华出口额达84万美元，由于禽流感，去年出口额暴跌到10万美元。,"In 2016, the export sales of ginseng chicken soup in China was 840,000 US dollars. Due to bird flu, the export sales of last year plummeted to 100,000 US dollars."

11175,河口口岸是中越边境云南段最大的口岸，位于云南省红河州河口县，与越南老街市隔河相望，属国家一类口岸。,Hekou port is the biggest port on China-Vietnam boarder in Yunnan. It is located in Hekou county in Honghe Prefecture in Yunnan Province with just a river away from Lao Cai City in Vietnam. It is a first-class national port.
11176,随着国家“一带一路”建设的不断深化，作为中国连接东南亚最便捷的通道之一，河口口岸出入境流量稳步增长。,"With the continuous enhancement of ""One Belt and One Road"" construction in China, as one of the most convenient passage connecting China and Southeast Asia, Hekou port has a steady growth of departure and entry flow."

The bright five-star red flag stretched out like an ""eagle stretching its wings"", and rose slowly with the melody of the majestic and impassioned national anthem."
11180,“在每个元旦、春节、国庆等具有重大意义的时间节点举行国庆升旗仪式，不仅展现了中国形象，还能激发边疆各族民众的爱国情怀 。 ”,"""It not only shows China's image, but also inspires the patriotism among people of all nationalities in border areas to held a flag-raising ceremony on every New Year's day, Spring Festival, National Day, and other time nodes of great significance.

11184,中国财政部、国家税务总局有关负责人30日表示，为保持政策稳定性，下一步在落实新个人所得税法时，将考虑继续对境外人士包括港澳台人士作出优惠安排。,"On 30th, the relevant principals from the Ministry of Finance of the People’s Republic of China and State Administration of Taxation said that in order to maintain the stability of the policy, the next step in implementing the new Individual Income Tax Law will consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan."
11185,负责人表示，现行个人所得税法实施条例对境外人士纳税问题有特殊优惠规定，在中国境内无住所但是居住一年以上五年以下的个人，其来源于中国境外的所得，可以只就由中国境内单位或者个人支付的部分缴纳个人所得税。,"The principals expressed that the current effective Individual Income Tax Law’s enforcement regulations have special preferential provisions for taxation issues for foreigners. For individuals who do not have a residence in China but have lived for more than one year and less than five years and earn incomes from outside China, their part of the payment by domestic units or individuals is subject to individual income tax."
11186,境外支付的部分不需要在中国境内缴纳个人所得税。,The portion of the overseas payment does not need to pay personal income tax in China.

11189,第73届联合国大会期间，各方围绕朝鲜半岛问题释放了一些积极信息。,"During the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, the parties released some positive information for the Korean Peninsula issue."
11190,韩国总统文在寅转述了朝方“不可逆转”的弃核决心，并表示美国总统特朗普和朝鲜最高领导人金正恩可能在今年年底前见面。,"South Korean President Moon Jae-in related the ""irreversible"" denuclearisation determination as told by the DPRK and said that US President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un may meet before the end of this year."
11191,美国国务院随后称，国务卿蓬佩奥将于10月访问朝鲜，以推动落实美朝领导人新加坡会晤承诺。,The US State Department subsequently stated that Secretary of State Pompeo will visit the DPRK in October to promote the implementation of the US-DPRK leadership meeting in Singapore.
11192,从今年年初至今，朝韩打破坚冰开启对话之路，朝韩、朝美领导人举行会晤，半岛局势缓和的大趋势保持延续，对话解决半岛问题的原则也得以坚持。,"From the beginning of this year to the present, the DPRK and the ROK broke the ice and opened the dialogue, and the DPRK - ROK and the DPRK-US leaders held meetings. The general trend of the easing of the peninsula has been continued, and the dialogue’s principle of solving the peninsula issue has also been adhered to."
11193,"首先 ， “ 半岛问题的本质是安全问题”这一点没有变,实现半岛和平，关键是妥善、平衡解决好各方的合理安全关切，而不是一味向对方施压、一味强调己方诉求。","First of all, the fact that ""the essence of the peninsula issue is a security issue"" has not changed. The key to realizing peace on the peninsula is to resolve the reasonable security concerns of all parties in a proper and balance manner, instead of putting pressure on the other side and stressing own demands."
11194,"其次，在实现半岛无核化的对话中，有关各方就实现半岛无核化的步骤和方式分歧犹在,由于朝美之间长期缺乏政治信任 ， “ 谁先谁后”的博弈思维依旧浓厚。","Secondly, in the dialogue to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties concerned are still divided on the steps and ways to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula. Due to the long-term lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United States, the game thinking of ""who is first and who is second"" is still strong."
11195,日前在纽约联合国总部召开的安理会朝鲜半岛问题公开会上，各方围绕对朝制裁问题发出的不同声音，再次凸显了半岛问题上这两点“没有变 ” 。,"At the public meeting of the UN Security Council Korean Peninsula issue held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices of the parties around the issue of sanctions against the DPRK once again highlighted the two points on the peninsula that have not changed."
11196,美国国务卿蓬佩奥坚持，在朝鲜半岛完全实现无核化之前，对朝鲜的制裁不会取消。,"Pompeo, US Secretary of State, insisted that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean Peninsula is fully denuclearized."
11197,而俄罗斯外长拉夫罗夫则强调了“要以行动回应行动”的原则，他指出 ： “ 制裁的削弱趋势应该与朝鲜在逐步弃核道路上迈出的步伐相同步 ” 。,"Lavrov, Russian Foreign Minister, stressed the principle of ""responding to action by action"". He pointed out: ""The weakening trend of sanctions should be in synchronization with the pace taken by North Korea on the road of gradual denuclearization."""
11198,毫无疑问，有关各方应当继续全面、完整、准确地执行安理会涉朝决议，但施压不是目的，执行制裁和推动政治解决都是安理会决议的要求，二者不可偏废，不可只选其一。,"Undoubtedly, all parties concerned should continue to implement the North Korea related resolutions of the UN Security Council in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner. However, pressuring is not an end. The implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are all requirements of the UN Security Council resolutions. The two cannot be neglected, and cannot only choose one"
11199,正如中国国务委员兼外长王毅所言，鉴于朝韩、朝美关系当前的积极进展，中方认为安理会有必要考虑适时启动可逆条款，从而鼓励朝鲜及有关各方朝着无核化方向迈出更大的步伐。,"As Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, in view of the current positive developments in the DPRK-ROK and DPRK-US relations, China believes that it is necessary for the UN Security Council to consider launching reversible clauses in a timely manner, thereby encouraging North Korea and relevant parties to take a big move toward denuclearization."
11200,回顾过去，半岛无核化及和平进程中的每一次进展，都需要各方展现足够的政治勇气。,"Review the past, every development in the denuclearization of the peninsula and in the peace process requires the parties to demonstrate sufficient political courage."
11201,当前，面对国际社会对推动政治解决半岛问题越来越高的期待，有关各方尤应展现政治魄力、作出政治决断，落实承诺、化解难题，持续迈出相向而行的步伐，并行推进半岛无核化进程与建立半岛和平机制，共同开创半岛的永久和平。,"At present, in the face of the international community’s increasingly high expectations for promoting a political solution to the peninsula issue, all parties concerned should demonstrate political courage, make political decisions, implement commitments, resolve problems, and continue to take the opposite direction and advance peninsula denuclearization process and establish a peace mechanism on the peninsula to jointly create a permanent peace on the peninsula."
11202,山西省临汾市吉县人民政府1日传来消息称，国庆节期间，位于该县的黄河壶口瀑布景区将保持比较高的水位，不具备开放条件。,"A message from Ji County People's Government in Linfen City in Shanxi Province on October 1 indicated that the scenic areas of Hukou Falls of Yellow River located in this county would maintain higher levels of water during the National Day holiday, so it didn't meet the requirements to be open to the public."
11203,为确保安全，国庆节期间景区暂时关闭。,"In order to ensure the safety, the scenic areas will be temporarily closed during the National Day holiday."
11204,黄河壶口瀑布是中国第二大瀑布，世界上最大的黄色瀑布。,"Hukou Falls of Yellow River is the second biggest fall in China, and the biggest yellow fall in the world."
11205,黄河奔流至此，两岸石壁峭立，河口收束狭如壶口，形成“千里黄河一壶收”的气概。,"The Yellow River flows here at great speed, and the stone walls on both sides are rising steeply. The river mouth becomes narrow like the spout of kettle, forming the situation that ""a thousand miles of Yellow River seems like to be collected into a kettle""."
11206,据记者了解，每年6月―10月是黄河汛期，从2018年7月12日开始，由于黄河高水位，山西黄河壶口景区就开始陆续关闭，因此壶口景区关闭累计已经近一个月。,"The reporter learned that the flood season of yellow river would come in every June to October. Due to high levels of water, the scenic areas of Hukou Falls of Yellow River in Shanxi Province had been closed one after another since July 12, 2018. Therefore, according to the accumulative calculation, Hukou scenic areas had been closed for nearly a month."
11207,壶口风景区管委会总工程师倪宇峰对媒体表示，这是近20年来，黄河高水位延续时间最长的一次 ， “ 之前没有关过这么久，2017年我们汛期关闭时间是4天，今年是近一个月 。 ”,"Ni Yufeng, the chief engineer of Hukou Scenic Areas Management Committee, said to the media that it was the longest time for the Yellow River to keep high levels of water during the past 20 years. ""It hasn't been closed for such a long time. We closed it for four days in the flood season in 2017. However, it has been closed for nearly a month. """
11208,据了解，山西黄河壶口瀑布景区原本为了迎接“十一”黄金周，还提前增加了人员安排以及车辆维护，甚至临时工作人员聘用等都已到位。,"It was learned that the scenic areas of Hukou Falls of Yellow River in Shanxi Province had originally arranged extra staff and vehicle maintenance in advance in order to be well-prepared for the ""National Day"" golden week, and even the temporary staff had been hired."
11209,据“黄河防汛抗旱总指挥部办公室明传电报”下发的《关于做好国庆节期间黄河防汛工作的通知》显示，要求青海、甘肃、宁夏、内蒙古、山西、陕西、河南、山东省做好国庆节期间黄河防汛工作。,"According to the ""Notice on Being Well-prepared for the Flood Control in the Yellow River during the National Day Holiday"" issued in the ""Office Telegram of Yellow River Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters"", Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong were required to be well-prepared for the flood control in the Yellow River during the National Day holiday."
11210,当前，黄河干流河道流量较大，上游河道流量维持在2000―3000立方米每秒，中游河道流量维持在2500―3500立方米每秒，下游河道流量维持在3000立方米每秒量级。,"Currently, the flow of the main stream of the Yellow River is relatively large. The upstream river flow is maintained at 2000-3000 cubic meters per second, the midstream river flow is maintained at 2500―3500 cubic meters per second, and the downstream river flow is maintained at 3000 cubic meters per second."

To facilitate the citizens to vaccinate with flu vaccine during the holiday, all the health centers and health stations under the Health Bureau will specially provide vaccination services from 9 am to 1 pm during the National Day Holidays ( October 1 through 2)."

By 4 pm on September 30, 4,158 people had been vaccinated, which was more than that of the same period last year for 3,714 people."
11214,免费接种对象包括以下澳门居民：6个月至18岁以下、50岁及以上人士、怀孕妇女、所有慢性病患者，包括肥胖人士（即身体质量指数BMI为30或以上者 ） ， 以及院舍、托儿所、幼稚园、小学、中学的工作人员，所有卫生工作者，以及在博彩娱乐场工作的澳门居民。,"Free vaccination objects include the following Macao residents: people under the age of 6 months to 18 years, people at the age of 50 and above, pregnant women, all patients with chronic diseases (including fat people, namely, the persons whose body mass index (BMI) is 30 or more), staff of institutions, nurseries, kindergartens, primary schools and middle schools, all the health workers and the Macao residents who work in the casino."
11215,同时，卫生局认为有必要接种的其他人员，包括公共部门，卫生局将主动联络有关机构取得名单後由卫生中心安排接种。,"Meanwhile, for the other people who are considered to be necessary to vaccinate by the Health Bureau, including the personnel of the public sectors, the Health Bureau will take the initiative to contact the relevant authorities to obtain the list and then the health centers will arrange them for vaccination."
11216,为方便接种者及减省轮候接种时间，卫生局将在今年10月至12月期间派出医护人员到本澳中学、小学、幼稚园及托儿所，为幼儿、中小幼学生、教师及员工等进行集体接种流感疫苗；此外，卫生局亦会安排人员到老人和残障院舍、人数较多的公共部门或其他机构等进行集体接种。,"To facilitate the vaccinees and reduce the waiting time for vaccination, the Health Bureau will send medical staff to Macao middle schools, primary schools, kindergartens and nurseries from October to December to perform collective influenza vaccination to the children, students, teachers and staff; in addition, the Health Bureau will also arrange staff to go to the institutions of the elderly and disabled, public sectors or other institutions with a large number of people to perform collective influenza vaccination."
11217,如未能参加集体接种的学生及幼儿，可於2018年12月3日起持澳门居民身份证、卫生局使用者卡、流感疫苗接种卡(如有 ) 、 学生证、员工证或职业证明文件到仁伯爵综合医院接种站或卫生中心接种。,"Students and children who fail to participate in the collective vaccination can take Macao resident identity cards, user cards of the Health Bureau, influenza vaccination cards (if any), student identity cards, employee identity cards or occupational certificates to the vaccination station of the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário or health centers from December 3, 2018."
11218,卫生局提醒居民，在2017年9月至2018年8月期间，曾接种2017至2018流感疫苗的人士，在2018年9月起仍需再接种新一季流感疫苗，因2018-2019年北半球流感疫苗含有的流感抗原成份已更新，其针对的是北半球2018-2019年冬季及2019年夏季季节性流感。,"The Health Bureau reminds residents that people who vaccinated with the 2017-2018 flu vaccine during September 2017 and August 2018 still need to vaccinate with the new seasonal flu vaccine from September 2018, since the flu antigen composition of 2018-2019 flu vaccine in the Northern Hemisphere has been updated , which is targeted at the seasonal influenza in winter of 2018-2019 and summer of 2019 in the Northern Hemisphere."
11219,澳门的流感高峰期一般在每年的1至3月出现，比温带地区（如中国北方和日本）较迟，卫生局呼吁老人、儿童、孕妇、肥胖人士及慢性病人等感染流感後较易出现并发症的高危人士及经常接触高危人士者应尽早接种疫苗。,"The peak of influenza in Macao usually occurs from January till March every year, later than that of the temperate regions (such as Northern China and Japan). The Health Bureau urges the elderly, children, pregnant women, fat people and chronic patients who are at high risk of complications after being infected with influenza and people who are in regular contact with high-risk people to get vaccinated as soon as possible."

11251,路透东京10月1日 - 日本央行周一公布的短观调查季报显示，9月当季日本大型制造业者的信心触及逾一年以来最低水平，原因是原材料成本上涨以及一系列自然灾害影响生产，让企业感受到了压力。,"Report of Reuters on October 1 in Tokyo: A quarterly Tankan survey report released by the Bank of Japan on Monday showed that the confidence of Japanese major manufacturers hit its lowest level in more than a year for that season in September, as raw material costs rose and a series of natural disasters affected production, putting pressure on enterprises."
11252,本次调查几乎未显示，不断升级的全球贸易摩擦打击了大型制造业者的信心。,This survey almost didn’t show that the escalating global trade frictions shook the confidence of large manufacturers.
11253,但爆发全面贸易战的风险打击了企业的业务前景，可能威胁企业资本支出。,"However, risks of outbreak of an all-out trade war stuck the business prospects of enterprises, likely to threaten the business capital expenditure."
11254,活跃的资本支出是日本经济中的一个亮点。,The active capital expenditure is a highlight of Japanese economy.
11255,该调查让人质疑日本央行关于稳健的经济扩张将有助于推动通胀率加速达到2%目标的看法，尽管有迹象显示企业正在逐渐将成本转嫁给客户。,"This survey raised questions about the view of the Bank of Japan on that robust economic expansion would help to accelerate inflation to the 2% target, although there were signs that enterprises were gradually shifting costs to the customers."
11256,“在全球贸易战引发担忧的情况下，由于出口放缓和工厂生产疲软，制造业者的信心趋于停滞 ， ” 农林中金总合研究所首席研究员南武志表示。,"""With concerns raised by the global trade war, as exports slowed down and factory production weakened, the confidence of manufacturers tended to stagnate,"" said Takeshi Minami, the Principal Researcher of Norinchukin Research Institute Co., Ltd.."

11264,资本支出稳健。,The capital expenditure was robust.
11265,尽管企业信心有所下降，但最新的短观凸显出企业资本支出计划稳健，得益于更新产能、以及增加对机器人和自动化投资以应对人口老龄化导致的劳动力短缺。,"Although the confidence of enterprises declined, the latest Tankan highlighted the robustness of enterprise capital expenditure plans, benefiting from the renewed capacity and increased investment in robots and automation to cope with the labor shortage caused by the aging of population."
11266,央行短观调查显示，大型企业计划在2019年3月止的本财年资本支出提高13.4 % 。,The Tankan survey of the Bank of Japan showed that the capital expenditure of large-scale enterprise plans would increase by 13.4% for the fiscal year ended in March 2019.
11267,前次短观调查时为13.6 % 。,It was 13.6% for previous Tankan survey.
11268,南武志表示，本财年所有企业资本支出计划增长8.5 % ， 接近日本泡沫经济时代的步伐。,"Takeshi Minami said that the capital expenditure of all enterprise plans for this fiscal year increased by 8.5%, close to the pace of Japan’s bubble era."
11269,他称 ， “ 鉴于小型企业调高从现在起的获利预估，资本支出仍有进一步增长的空间，但这很大程度上取决于贸易战对企业信心的影响 。 ”,"He said, ""considering that small businesses raise their profit estimates from now on, there is still room for further growth in capital expenditure, but that largely depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence. """
11270,短观调查显示企业转嫁成本的能力增强，大型企业产出价格指数为正7，是十年来的高点，这是令人鼓舞的迹象，反映出日本对抗通缩的努力取得了进展。,"The Tankan survey showed that the ability of enterprises to pass on costs was enhanced. The output price index of large enterprises was positive 7, which was a 10-year high spot. It was an encouraging sign, reflecting that Japan had made progress in its efforts to combat deflation."
11271,衡量大型企业就业状况的指数触及负23，为1992年以来最为紧俏的水平，凸显就业市场趋紧。,"The index measuring the employment situation of large enterprises hit negative 23, which was the most tight level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the employment market."
11272,受益于企业支出强健，日本经济第二季自今年1-3月的萎缩中反弹。,"Benefiting from the robust enterprise expenditure, Japanese economy rebounded from January-March shrink in the second quarter."
11273,但夏季贸易摩擦升级且供应链受到自然灾害的干扰，令依赖出口的日本经济前景蒙阴。,"However, the escalation of trade frictions in summer and the disturbance of natural disasters on supply chains had casted a shadow over the prospects of Japanese economy which depended on exports."

11330,中国工业和信息化部副部长、国家航天局局长张克俭在出席交流活动时介绍了中国的航天计划，并表示中国将扩大航天领域的国际合作，为人类的航天事业作出贡献。,"Zhang Kejian, the vice-minister of Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China and the head of China National Space Administration, introduced China's space program while he was attending the interchange activity, and said that China would expand the international cooperation in the aerospace field and make contributions to humans' aerospace industry."

11332,国际宇航大会自1950年以来每年举办一次，是世界航空界的最大盛会。,The International Astronautical Congress has been held annually since 1950. It is the world's largest event in the aviation industry.
11333,本届大会为期5天，由国际宇航联合会、国际宇航科学院、不来梅大学应用科技和微重力研究中心、国际空间法学会等联合主办。,"This congress will last for 5 days. It is co-hosted by the International Astronautical Federation, the International Academy of Astronautics, the Applied Science and Technology and Microgravity Research Center in University of Bremen, and International Institute of Space Law, etc."
11334,路透北京11月5日 - 中国对外贸易中心周日发布的新闻稿称，广交会显示中国外贸形势依然复杂严峻，80.6%的企业预计2018年全年出口情况好于上年或者持平。,"Report of Reuters on November 5 in Beijing: According to a press release released on Sunday by the China Foreign Trade Center, the Canton Fair showed that the situation of China's foreign trade was still complex and serious, with expectation of 80.6% of enterprises exports in 2018 to be better than or maintain at the same level as last year."
11335,但考虑到国内原材料、劳动力等综合要素成本持续上升、中美贸易摩擦影响加大的外部环境，参展企业同时认为明年的出口形势不容乐观。,"However, in consideration of the rising costs of domestic raw materials, labor force and other comprehensive factors, as well as the external environment of the increasing impact of Sino-US trade frictions, exhibitors also believed that the export situation of next year was not optimistic."
11336,"第124届广交会闭幕新闻发布会上, 广交会副秘书长、新闻发言人、中国对外贸易中心副主任徐兵表示，本届广交会境外采购商到会人数和出口成交均同比微降。","At the closing press conference of the 124th Canton Fair, Xu Bing, the deputy secretary-general and spokesman of the Canton Fair, and the vice-director of the China Foreign Trade Center, said that the number of overseas buyers and export transactions of this Canton Fair had declined slightly compared with the same period of last year."
11337,"本届采购商到会189,812人，来自215个国家和地区，同比下降1.11 % 。","The number of buyers who attended this Canton Fair was 189,812 and they came from 215 countries and regions, with a decrease of 1.11% on year-on-year basis."
11338,"出口成交2,064.94亿元人民币（折合298.6亿美元 ） ， 同比下降1 % 。","The amount of export transactions was 206.494 billion yuan ($29.86 billion), with a decrease of 1% on year-on-year basis."
11339,从市场看，对日本、东盟十国 、 “ 金砖四国 ” 、 韩国成交分别增长74.4 % 、 11.4 % 、 7.2 % 、 2.5 % ， 对美国、澳大利亚、加拿大和欧盟等传统市场分别下降30.3 % 、 8.9 % 、 7.3 % 、 0.8 % 。,"From the perspective of the market, the transactions with Japan, the ten ASEAN countries, ""the BRICS countries"" and Korea increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2% and 2.5% respectively, while the transactions with traditional markets of the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union decreased by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% and 0.8% respectively."
11340,从行业看，运输工具、机械设备、建筑及装饰材料、电子消费品及信息产品、卫浴设备分别增长24.8 % 、 21.1 % 、 20.0 % 、 15.1 % 、 和7.6 % ， 纺织服装、家用电器分别下降13.0 % 、 6.7 % 。,"From the perspective of the industry, the transactions of transportation tools, machinery and equipment, building and decorative materials, electronic consumer goods, information products, and sanitary equipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0% and 15.1% respectively, while the transactions with textile clothing and household appliances decreased by 13.0% and 6.7% respectively."
11341,徐兵表示，作为中国外贸的晴雨表和风向标，本届广交会采购商与会态势和出口成交数据表明，明年中国外贸发展仍然面临诸多不确定不稳定因素。,"Xu Bing said that as a barometer and weathervane of China's foreign trade, the buyers’ participation situation and the export transaction data of this Canton Fair showed that China's foreign trade development would still face many uncertain and unstable factors next year."
11342,但随着供给侧结构性改革的深入推进，以及近期国家和地方陆续出台了“六稳”等方面的政策措施，中国外贸发展的新动能正在加快积聚，企业市场多元化不断取得新进展，这些都是外贸发展的重要基础和有力条件。,"However, with the deepening of supply-side structural reform and the ""six stability"" policies and measures recently introduced by the state and local governments in succession, the new drivers for the development of China’s foreign trade was accelerating the accumulation, and the diversification of enterprises and markets had made new progress, all of which were the important foundation and strong conditions for the development of foreign trade."
11343,“综合各方因素，预计全年中国外贸进出口将保持平稳增长，质量和效益进一步提高 。 ”徐兵称。,"""Taking all factors into consideration, it is expected that the imports and exports of China's foreign trade will maintain a steady growth throughout the year, with further improvement in quality and efficiency. "" Xu Bing said."
11344,中国海关总署公布，以美元计价9月出口同比增长14.5 % ， 进口同比增长14.3 % ， 9月贸易顺差为316.9亿美元，9月出口增速和贸易顺差均为今年2月以来最高。,"The China’s General Administration of Customs published that priced in dollars, the exports in September increased by 14.5% on year-on-year basis, the imports increased by 14.3% on year-on-year basis, the trade surplus in September was $31.69 billion, and the export growth rate and trade surplus in September were the highest since February."
11345,尽管中美贸易摩擦不断升级，中国9月出口表现仍大幅超预期，外需旺盛、企业在美国加征关税前抢出口叠加人民币汇率贬值，或是主要支撑因素，也一定程度显示了中国外贸的韧性，但中美贸易战对信心的打击、对产业链的冲击不容小觑，分析人士认为中国外贸的挑战可能会在四季度或明年显现。,"In despite of the escalating trade frictions between China and the United States, China's export performance in September still significantly exceeded expectation. Strong external demand, and the enterprises rushing to export before imposing tariffs in the United States and the depreciation of RMB exchange rate, might be the main supporting factors, and also showed the resilience of China's foreign trade to a certain extent. However, the impact of the Sino-US trade war on confidence and the industrial chain can not be neglected. Analysts believed that the challenges for China's foreign trade might emerge in the fourth quarter or next year."
11346,路透调查显示，美国基金经理9月建议增加持有现金，继续保持谨慎立场，因美国和中国开始最新一轮互征进口关税，且争端没有出现缓和的迹象。,"Reuters surveys showed that the U.S. fund managers proposed to increase cash holdings and stood the cautious ground in September, since the United States and China began the latest round of mutual import tariffs and there was no sign of dispute easing."
11347,但据参与本次调查的12位基金经理建议，北美资产配置增至2017年6月以来最高，而英国、欧元区特别是新兴市场持仓下降。,"However, according to the suggestion of 12 fund managers who participated in this survey, the asset allocation in North America rose to the highest level since June 2017, while positions in Britain, the Eurozone and particularly emerging markets declined."
11348,全球股票配置占比平均为56.6 % ， 债券占比为35.5 % ， 基本与上个月的调查一致。,"The average of global stock allocation accounted for 56.6% and the bonds accounted for 35.5%, which was basically consistent with the survey of last month."
11349,其最明显的变化就是，现金配比上升至5.1 % ， 为2014年12月以来最高。,"The most obvious change was that the cash ratio rose to 5.1%, which was the highest proportion since December 2014."
11350,一位大型基金公司的基金经理表示 ， “ 一些经济数据为市场带来了信心，但贸易战仍是最大的担忧，所以最好做好准备在市场回落时进入 。 ”,"A fund manager of a large fund company said, ""Some economic data have brought confidence to the market, but the trade war is still the biggest concern, so that it's better to get prepared to enter when the market falls after a rise. """
11351,但基金经理9月仍偏好股票，特别是美国股票，即便美国股票被认为价格偏高。,"However, the fund managers still preferred stocks in September, especially American stocks, even though the price of American stocks were considered to be on the high side."
11352,今天，在中国的开放地标上海，全球首个以进口为主题的大型国家级展会 ― ― 中国国际进口博览会，于万众期待中正式拉开帷幕。,"Today, in Shanghai, the opening-up landmark of China, China International Import Expo (CIIE), the world's first large-scale state-level exhibition with the theme of import, has officially opened in much anticipation."
11353,一场展会就像一扇“窗 ” ， 能让世界更好地了解一座城市和一个国家。,"An exhibition is like a ""window"" which can let the world know a city and a country better."
11354,透过进博会这扇“窗 ” ， 人们看到迈向更高层次的“开放中国 ” ； 借助进博会这扇“窗 ” ， 欢迎世界与“改革开放再出发”的中国互利共赢。,"Through the ""window"" of CIIE, people can see the ""opening-up China"" which moves towards a higher level; with the help of the ""window"" of CIIE, we welcome the world and China which is ""restarting from reform and opening-up"", to achieve mutual benefits and win-win results."
11355,“对一个国家而言，开放如同破茧成蝶，虽会经历一时阵痛，但将换来新生 。 ”,"""For a country, opening-up is like coming out of the cocoon and becoming a butterfly. There will be pain, but there will be new life. """
11356,习近平总书记对开放之路的总结，道出了“中国为什么能”的一个重要原因。,"General Secretary Xi Jinping's summary of Open Road reveals an important reason ""why China can do it""."
11357,回顾改革开放40年，敢于扎进世界市场汪洋大海的中国，虽然遇到过漩涡和风浪，但始终以开放的姿态面对一切风险挑战，不断释放内生动力，不断提高竞争能力。,"Looking back on the past 40 years of reform and opening-up, China dares to plunge into the vast sea of the world market. Although it has encountered whirlpool and storm, it always faces all risks and challenges with an open attitude, constantly releases its endogenous driving force and continuously improves its competitiveness."
11358,可以说，中国用自身实打实的成就，有力诠释了开放的价值和意义。,"So to speak, China has fully demonstrated the value and significance of opening-up with its solid achievements."
11359,站在新的历史起点上，举办以进口为主题的博览会，是以习近平同志为核心的党中央着眼推进新一轮高水平对外开放作出的一项重大决策，是中国主动向世界开放市场的重大举措，是中国支持经济全球化和贸易自由化的实际行动，展示了“中国开放的大门不会关闭，只会越开越大”的强烈且清晰的意愿。,"Standing at a new historical starting point, it is a major decision to hold an expo with the theme of import made by the Party Central Committee with the core of Comrade Xi Jinping with a view to promoting a new round of high-level opening to the outside world. It is a major measure for China to actively open the market to the world and is also a practical action taken by China to support the economic globalization and trade liberalization, showing a strong and clear will that ""China's opening door won't close, but would open wider and wider""."
11360,而各国参展商报名踊跃、展位“一位难求 ” ， 就是对中国在更大范围、更宽领域、更深层次发展开放型经济的最大肯定与最佳回应。,"Exhibitors from all over the world are eager to enroll in the exhibition, and ""it is difficult to apply for a stand"", which is the greatest affirmation and best response to China's development of an open economy in a larger scope, a wider range of fields and at a deeper level."
11361,更重要的是，当前全球经贸秩序走到了一个十字路口。,"More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroad."
11362,有些国家筑起贸易保护主义的高墙、退回单边主义的老路，增加了国际社会对自由贸易前景的忧虑，也给正回暖的世界经济增添了诸多不确定性。,"Some countries have built trade protectionist walls and retreated into the unilateralism, which increases anxiety of the international society about the prospects for free trade and adds much uncertainty to a recovering world economy."
11363,在这样的时代背景下，黄浦江畔的此次盛会，体现了中国对自由贸易的捍卫，让世界看到开放市场、共享未来的中国自信和中国担当。,"Under such era background, this grand gathering along the Huangpu River demonstrates China's guard to free trade and shows the world China's confidence and responsibility to open its markets and share its future."
11364,独行快，众行远。,It is fast to go alone but it is further to go in crowds.
11365,中国敞开胸怀，拥抱世界，不仅有力促进了自身发展，也给世界各国和地区带来了澎湃的“中国机遇 ” 。,"By embracing the world with an open mind, China has not only vigorously promoted its own development, but also brought about tremendous ""China opportunities"" to other countries and regions."
11366,近年来，倡导和推动共建“一带一路 ” 、 发起创办亚投行、设立丝路基金 … … 中国提供了一系列国际公共产品，提供了实实在在的出口市场、发展机会和就业岗位，让各国企业搭乘中国发展“快车 ” “ 便车 ” 。,"In recent years, by advocating and promoting the joint development of the ""One Belt and One Road"", initiating and setting up the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and establishing the Silk Road fund... China has provided a series of international public goods, a solid export market, development opportunities and jobs, allowing companies of various countries to get a ride on the ""express train"" and take ""hitchhiking"" of China's development."
11367,进博会也是这样的一个公共产品、一个全球经贸合作的大平台。,CIIE is also this kind of public goods and a big platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
11368,在这个平台之上，130多个国家和地区的3000多家企业，带着各具特色的优质产品和服务闪亮登场，迈出在中国市场新的一步。,"On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions have made their debut with high-quality products and services with distinctive features, taking a new step into the Chinese market."
11369,除了各国企业，真正受益的还有国内消费者。,"Apart from companies of various countries, the real beneficiaries are domestic consumers."
11370,通过搭建这个“优选优进”的平台，为消费升级提供了多渠道的优质供给，满足人民群众个性化、多元化、差异化消费需求。,"By building the platform of ""selecting the best and importing the best"", we can provide multiple channels of high-quality supply for consumption upgrading and meet people's personalized, diversified and differentiated consumption needs."
11371,随着中国开放的大门越开越大，货畅其流，物尽其用，迈向美好生活的脚步会更加坚实。,"As China's opening-up door opens wider and wider, the goods flow is smooth and materials are put to good use, thus the pace towards a better life will be more solid."
11372,从更宏观的角度来看，进博会的意义已经超出了经济与贸易的范畴，而是着眼未来，传达开放、包容、普惠、平衡、共赢的理念，形成共同应对当今挑战的共识。,"From a broader perspective, the significance of CIIE has gone beyond the scope of economy and trade. It has the future in mind, conveys the concepts of openness, inclusiveness, universal benefit, balance and win-win, and forms a consensus to jointly meet today's challenges."
11373,世界好，中国才能好；中国好，世界才更好。,"Only when the world is doing well can China do well; when China is good, the world is better."
11374,我们期待，进博会带给世界精彩与圆满；我们更憧憬，迈向更高层次的“开放中国”与世界携手构建人类命运共同体的光辉未来。,"We expect CIIE to make the world wonderful and complete; we are looking forward to the bright future that an ""opening-up China"" moving to a higher level and the world build a community of human destiny."

11380,此前，加拿大外交部长弗里兰的发言人表示，加拿大只会签署有利的协议 ， “ 重点在实质面，而非时间表。我们将持续磋商，希望达成符合加拿大国家利益的协议 。 ”,"Previously, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said that Canada would only sign a favorable agreement, and ""the focus is on substance rather than timetables.

11386,在经历了20多年的权利斗争后，巴西女性依然没有成功获得自己应有的权利。,"After more than 20 years of power struggle, Brazilian women still have not succeeded in obtaining their reserved rights."
11387,巴西社会学家娜塔莉亚・莫里(Natalia Mori)指出，这种现象存在的原因在于古老的父系社会、种族主义以及资本主义价值观共同作用的结果。,"According to Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori, the existence of this phenomenon is because of the combined effects of ancient patriarchal society, racialism, and capitalism values."
11388,“政治本应由国民主张公民权利、身份、获得公共产品并由多个社会团体组成同一个社会。但巴西的政治属于某一团体的垄断，大多数人口并没有被代表 。 ”,"""Politics should be civil rights, identity, access to public goods, and the formation of the same society by multiple social groups advocated by citizens.

11412,但由于美国当前的增长得益于减税这一财政刺激争取来的时间，因此该国经济也受到外界的密切关注。,"However, since the current growth in the United States benefits from a fiscal stimulus of tax cuts which buy time, the country's economy also attracts close attention of the outside world."
11413,“随着美国正恢复充分就业，经济出现滑坡是在所难免的 。 ”,"""As the United States is restoring full employment, the economic downturn is inevitable. """

11415,尽管巴克莱对今年年底前的美国经济前景持乐观态度，但该银行承认，对更远的时间做出预测难度更大。,"Although Barclays is optimistic about the outlook for the U.S. economy by the end of this year, the bank acknowledges that it is more difficult to predict the longer term."
11416,“在缺乏更为可持续的投资增长来提振经济增长潜力的情况下，当前由财政政策激励的增长将难以为继 ， ” 巴克莱经济学家在一份研究报告中说。,"""Under the circumstance that is lack of more sustainable investment growth to boost economic growth potential, current fiscal policy-driven growth will be unsustainable,"" Economist Barclays indicated in a research report."

11420,但下周数据面的重点必然将是将在下周五公布的美国非农就业数据，该数据将提供有关紧俏的就业市场是否在推动薪资大幅增长的线索。,"However, the focus of data for next week will definitely be the American non-farm employment data, which will be released next Friday. This data will provide clues for whether the tight job market is driving large wage growth."
11421,其重要性不仅因其对于企业的盈利能力和消费者的购买力而言很重要，还因为薪资跳增或引发整体通胀上升，可能让美国联邦储备委员会(美联储/FED)官员感到不安。,"Its importance is not only for the reason that it is important for corporate profitability and consumer purchasing power, but also because wage jumps may cause overall inflation, which may upset the officials of the Federal Reserve Board."
11422,“薪资将备受关注，因为可能环比前月再次大幅上升。,"""Salaries will be of great concern, as they may rise sharply again compared with the last month."
11423,9月较上年同期升幅可能不会突破3 % ， 但我们完全可以预期下月能突破 ， ” 荷兰国际集团(ING)经济学家在一份研究报告中写道。,"In September, the growth may not exceed 3% over the same period last year, but we can fully expect a breakthrough next month,"" ING economists wrote in a research report."
11424,在中国和亚洲其他地区放假导致该地区下周数据面清淡之际，欧洲政局可能会成为市场波动的来源。,"On the occasion that holidays in China and other regions of Asia lead to a bleak data for the region next week, the European political situation may become a source of market volatility."
11425,意大利政府无视之前对欧盟作出的财政承诺，欧盟其他成员国将必须迅速确定是否对意大利的这一决定予以坚决反对。特里亚并不支持该决定，他希望遵守欧盟规则。,"The Italian government disregards previous financial commitments to the EU, and other EU Member States will have to quickly determine whether to resolutely oppose this decision. Tria doesn't support this decision, and he hopes to comply with the EU rules."

11429,9月29日，中国首艘3000吨级大型浮标船“向阳红22”轮在中国武船集团下水。,"On September 29, the first 3000-ton large-scale buoy vessel ""Xiangyanghong 22"" was launched in Wuchang Shipbuilding Industry Group Co.,Ltd."
11430,该船建成后将打破目前中国在大型浮标、潜标布放、回收、抢修等保障工作中的装备瓶颈。,"Upon completion of this vessel, it will break the current equipment bottleneck of support work, such as the launching, retrieval and repair of large-scale buoys and subsurface buoys in China."

11437,中新网青岛10月1日电 受台风“潭美”响的影响，原定9月30日开赛的2018国际极限帆船系列赛青岛站“玛泽润杯”将首个比赛日推迟至10月1日进行，并于赛前在青岛奥帆中心举行赛前见面会，来自6个国家和地区的12支水翼双体帆船队船长悉数亮相。,"ECNS, Qingdao, October 1 -- Affected by Typhoon Trami, the first race day of 2018 Qingdao ""Mazarin"" Cup powered by Extreme Sailing Series was postponed from September 30 to October 1, and the pre-game meeting was held before the race in Olympic Sailing Center in Qingdao. The captains of 12 hydrofoil catamaran teams from 6 countries and regions attended at the meeting."
11438,受台风“潭美”响的影响，港池内强风不断，最大风速甚至高达24节，启航信号从30日下午1点推迟了近90分钟，风速仍不见降低，赛事总裁判安妮・姆德兰特宣布取消首日的比赛，将比赛推迟至10月1日下午进行。,"Affected by Typhoon Trami, the strong winds constantly blew in the harbor basin and the maximum wind speed even reached 24 knots. The sailing signal was delayed by nearly 90 minutes from 1:00 pm on September 30. The wind speed was still not reduced, so the Race Director Anne Mallédant announced to cancel the race of the first day and postpone the race to the afternoon on October 1."
11439,“从岸上吹来的强风持续不断，海况实在是太剧烈了 。 ”,"""The strong winds from the shore never seem to stop, and the state of the sea is so severe. """
11440,姆德兰特解释道 ： “ 这样的情况下，谁也不知道阵风什么时候以何种风力刮向赛船。,"Mallédant explained: ""No one knows the time when the gust will blow to the racing boats as well as the scale of wind force."
11441,靠近城市的赛场，以目前的风况来说，取消比赛是最明智的选择 。 ”,"Since the boat-sailing field is near the city, so far as it goes, the wisest choice is to cancel the race. """
11442,一切准备就绪的船员来说仍不免有些失望。,The sailors still felt a little disappointed for everything was ready.
11443,“赛船已经准备停当，我们状态也不错 。 ”,"""The racing boats are ready, and we are in excellent condition. """
11444,青岛队的舵手麦克斯・理查森坦言 ： “ 但我知道比赛改期是正确的选择，而且希望今天风能小些，我们能一展身手 。 ”,"The helmsman of Qingdao Team Max Richardson said frankly: ""But I know it is a right choice to change the race date. And I hope the wind will die down today, so that we can do some good. """
11445,被誉为2020年东京奥运会新西兰队的“希望之星”欧米卡・威尔金森表示 ： “ 损失了一天的时间反而让比赛变得更有意思。,"Micah Wilkinson, the ""Hope Star"" of New Zealand Team for 2020 Tokyo Olympiad, said: ""Losing a day's time makes the race more interesting."

11447,大家一定会特别拼命 。 ”,"All of us will play hard. """
11448,虽然海风剧烈，但法国ABM队的舵手皮埃尔・伊维斯・杜兰德在赛前见面会上诉说了自己与比赛举办地青岛的温情往事：5年前的国际极限帆船系列赛自己意外受伤，肌肉断裂，多亏当地赛事医疗团队的处理才让自己还能在5年后的今天站在比赛场地。,"Though the sea wind blew violently, the helmsman of French ABM Team Pierre-Yves Durand told his warm memories with Qingdao at the pre-game meeting that he was accidentally injured in the Extreme Sailing Series 5 years ago, resulting in the muscular rupture, and fortunately, the local race medical team helped him deal with it so that he could stand here to take part in the race after 5 years."
11449,据悉，国际极限帆船系列赛创办于2007年，是与沃尔沃、美洲杯、世界帆船对抗巡回赛等赛事齐名的世界帆联赛事。,"It was learned that the Extreme Sailing Series started from 2007, and it was an ISAF game equivalent to the Volvo Ocean Race, the America's Cup and the World Match Racing Tour."
11450,此次青岛站比赛将采用“飞行幽灵”水翼双体帆(FlyingPhantom ) 。,"The hydrofoil catamaran of ""FlyingPhantom"" would be used in this race in Qingdao."
11451,2018年是该赛事登陆“帆船之都”青岛的第8个年头，青岛站也是该系列赛收官之战。,"It is the 8th year of having this race in Qingdao, the ""City of Sails"". And it is the last race of this Series."
11452,尽管环球金融市场震荡持续，香港金融管理局周一称，外汇基金于今年第三季的投资收入按年大减97%但好于上一季表现，因在中美贸易战之下，海外股票水涨船高，外汇亏损亦明显收窄。,"Although the turbulence in global financial markets continued, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Monday that the investment income of the Exchange Fund in the third quarter of this year fell by 97% annually, and it was better than that in the previous quarter, since overseas stocks rose and foreign exchange losses obviously narrowed under the China-U.S. trade war."
11453,据金管局最新数据，2018年7-9月外汇基金录得投资收入16亿港元，大幅低于去年同期的618亿港元，但好于今年第二季经修订的1亿港元。,"According to the latest data of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$1.6 billion from July to September 2018, significantly lower than HK$61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK$100 million in the second quarter of this year."
11454,金管局总裁陈德霖在立法会上表示，中美贸易战之初，香港及新兴市场股票指数与美股指数背道而驰，直至9月底、10月初美国股市指数陆续见顶后，市场情绪开始逆转，因投资者渐渐意识到贸易战对美国本身亦造成不利。,"Chen Delin, the president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said on the legislative session that at the beginning of the China-U.S. trade war, the share index in Hong Kong and emerging markets ran counter to the U.S. share index. By the end of September and early October, after the U.S. share index peaked in succession, the market sentiment began to reverse, since investors gradually realized that the trade war was also detrimental to the U.S. itself."
11455,“市场情绪出现变化是好事，如果贸易战只有单方面的影响，对解决事情帮助不大 。 ”,"""It is good to have changes in the market sentiment. If the trade war only has unilateral effects, it doesn't help much for solving problems. """
11456,但他同时指出 ， “ 如中美贸易战未能解决，金融市场波动会持续上升 。 ”,"He also pointed out that ""if the trade war cannot be solved, the fluctuation of financial markets will continue to rise. """
11457,今年第三季，外汇基金于香港的股票投资亏损较上一季收窄8%至47亿港元，海外股票投资收益则大增172%至128亿港元；外汇亏损162亿港元，债券收益97亿港元，按季分别减少24%及31 % ， 主要反映出美元在季内兑主要货币普遍上升以及美国孳息率在9月中升破3厘水平。,"In the third quarter of this year, the stock investment losses of the Exchange Fund in Hong Kong narrowed by 8% to HK$4.7 billion compared with the previous quarter, and the investment income of overseas stock increased by 17.2% to HK$12.8 billion; the foreign exchange losses was HK$16.2 billion and the bond yields was HK$9.7 billion, with a decrease of 24% and 31% respectively, mainly reflecting the general rise of the US dollar for exchange of major currencies in this quarter and the rise of the US coupon rate to above 3% in mid-September."
11458,外汇基金主要用以支持港元。,The Exchange Fund was mainly used for supporting Hong Kong dollars.
11459,香港自1983年起实行港元与美元挂钩的联系汇率制度。,Hong Kong has implemented the linked exchange rate system for the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the US dollar since 1983.
11460,对于香港目前的金融形势，陈德霖称，经济和资产市场不确定性增加，下行风险增大，但香港金融体系稳健，亦做好防御，抗震能力充裕。,"As for the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Delin said that the uncertainty of the economic and asset markets increased and downside risks increased, but the financial system Hong Kong was robust, so that good defence were made and the earthquake-resistant capacity was abundant."
11461,“香港的国际投资头寸充裕，对外净资产值为1.4万亿美元相当于GDP的4倍，高于新加坡的2.5倍和日本的0.6倍，要应付经济下行周期或逆转足够有余 。 ”,"""The international investment position is abundant in Hong Kong, with a net external asset value of US$1.4 trillion, which is 4 times GDP, higher than 2.5 times in Singapore and 0.6 times in Japan. It is enough to cope with the financial downturns or reversal. """
11462,近期港元拆息持续回落并与美元利差扩大，陈德霖指出，港元汇价于9月21日曾经升逾400个基点，市场普遍认为主要与港元拆息上升有关，其后港元兑美元在7.80-7.84附近水平徘徊，到最近港元拆息持续回落，与美元利差扩大，可能会吸引市场沽港元、买美元的套息活动增加，令港元再度触发弱方兑换保证的机会较前一段时间为大。,"The current daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars continued to fall and the interest margin with US dollars expanded. Chen Delin pointed out that the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar rose more than 400 basis points on September 21. The markets generally believed that it was mainly related to the rise of the daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars. And then the Hong Kong dollar hovered around 7.80-7.84 for exchange of the US dollar. Until recently, the daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars continued to fall, and the interest margin with US dollars expanded, which might attract more hedging activities to sell the Hong Kong dollar and buy the US dollar, triggering the opportunity of the exchange guarantee of the weak side again to increase compared with that of the previous period."
11463,但他认为，随着香港银行加息周期开始，港元利率正常化进行中，未来港元利率低于美元利率的情况将会改变。,"However, he believed that as the interest-rate rise cycle of the Hong Kong Bank began and the Hong Kong dollar interest rates were normalizing, the situation that Hong Kong dollar interest rates were lower than US dollar interest rates would change in the future."
11464,“港元利率与美元利率走势将更加趋向一致，大家必须更加小心管理风险，做好准备，应付市场波动 。 ”,"""The trend of Hong Kong dollar interest rates and US dollar interest rates will be more consistent. Everyone must be more careful to manage risks and prepared to cope with market fluctuations. """
11465,由于港元资金十分充裕，港元拆息进一步回落，三个月拆息周一下跌0.9%至2.08179 % ， 与美元息差由46个基点扩至51个基点；一个月拆息则创五个月新低，与美元息差由120个基点扩大至127个基点。,"Since the funds of the Hong Kong dollar was abundant, the daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars fell further. The three-month daily interest rates on private loan fell by 0.9% to 2.08179% on Monday, and the interest rate differential with the US dollar increased from 46 basis points to 51 basis points; the one-month daily interest rates on private loan hit the bottom within five months, and the interest rate differential with the US dollar increased from 120 basis points to 127 basis points."
11466,自5月至9月中，港元现货汇率大部分时间贴近7.85兑1美元。,"From May to mid-September, the spot rate of Hong Kong dollars was close to 7.85 with exchange of $1 most of the time."
11467,期间，由于套息活动及大型招股活动完结后部分招股所得资金流出港元等因素，导致弱方兑换保证继4月首次被触发后，于5月及8月再多次被触发。,"During that time, due to factors of partial share offer gained outflows from Hong Kong dollars after the completion of interest arbitrage activities and large-scale share offer activities, causing that the exchange guarantee for the weak side was triggered for the first time in April, and for many times in May and August."
11468,金管局按照联系汇率制度在7.85水平买入港元、沽出美元，以维持港元汇率稳定。,"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority bought Hong Kong dollars and sold Hong Kong dollars at the level of 7.85 according to the linked exchange rate system, in order to maintain the stability of the exchange rate of Hong Kong dollars."
11469,金管局于5月及8月在弱方兑换保证机制下共买入约521亿港元。,The Hong Kong Monetary Authority bought around HK$52.1 billion under the mechanism of exchange guarantee of the weak side from May to August.
11470,新个税法对境外人士是否还有优惠？,Does foreigners can benefit from the new Individual Income Tax Law?
11471,财政部、税务总局有关负责人30日答记者问时表示，为保持政策稳定性，下一步在落实新个人所得税法时，将考虑继续对境外人士包括港澳台人士作出优惠安排。,"On 30th, the relevant person in charge from Ministry of Finance and State Administration of Taxation answered the reporters that in order to maintain the stability of the policy, the next step in implementing the new Individual Income Tax Law will consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan."
11472,有记者问，新修订的个人所得税法将我国个人所得税居民纳税人判定标准由满一年调整为满183天。,Some reporters asked that the newly revised Individual Income Tax Law will adjust the criterion for resident taxpayers of China’s Individual Income Tax Law from one year to 183 days.
11473,请问下一步在实施该法时，对境外人士包括港澳台人士是否还有优惠安排？,"""May I ask if there are any preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, in implementing this new law?"""
11474,负责人回应称，现行个人所得税法实施条例对境外人士纳税问题有特殊优惠规定，在中国境内无住所但是居住一年以上五年以下的个人，其来源于中国境外的所得，可以只就由中国境内单位或者个人支付的部分缴纳个人所得税。,"The principals responded that the current effective Individual Income Tax Law’s enforcement regulations have special preferential provisions for taxation issues for foreigners. For individuals who do not have a residence in China but have lived for more than one year and less than five years and earn incomes from outside China, their part of the payment by domestic units or individuals is subject to individual income tax."
11475,负责人表示，为保持政策稳定性，下一步在落实新个人所得税法时，将考虑继续对境外人士包括港澳台人士作出优惠安排。,"The principals said that in order to maintain the stability of the policy, the next step in implementing the new Individual Income Tax Law will consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan."
11476,尚无“门槛”的月子中心：质量认证促使提升品质。,"The confinement center without ""threshold"": quality certification would promote the quality."
11477,随着“两孩经济”的拉动、母婴市场的繁荣，从北上广到三四线城市，各地纷纷兴起了各种档次的月子会所。,"As the ""two-child economic"" develops and the maternal and child market thrives, various grades of confinement service centers appeared around China, from Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to the 3rd and 4th tier cities."
11478,当下很火的月子会所满足了群众的消费需求，收费从几万元乃至几十万元不等，但同时也处于尴尬境地，这个机构目前为止没有门槛，监管还存在空白地带。,"The popular confinement service centers, which could satisfy the consumer's demands, charged from tens of thousands of yuan to hundreds of thousands of yuan. However, they were in an awkward situation, because this kind of institution had no threshold at all, and there was still the There is still a blank zone in regulation."
11479,国家市场监管总局近日开展2018年全国“质量月”系列活动，记者来到天津市一家五星级月子中心探访母婴护理服务认证体验。,"Recently, the State Administration for Market Regulation carried out a series of activities of 2018 National ""Quality Month"". The reporter came to a five-star confinement center in Tianjin to explore the certification of maternal and child care services."
11480,一般的月子中心提供新生儿护理、营养餐、产后修复塑形等服务。,"A common confinement center provided the services of newborn care, nutritious food, and postpartum reconstruction, etc."
11481,在这家月子中心，记者看到，护士每日检查新生儿哺乳情况，专业护工为新生儿提供洗澡、抚触等精细护理服务。,"The reporter found in this confinement center that the nurses would check the newborn breastfeeding each day, and the professional nursing workers would provide the newborns with the careful nursing services, such as bathing and touching."
11482,同时，为满足新妈妈的需求，从月子初期伤口护理，到月子中后期美体护理等服务，提供中医治疗美容等护理项目，帮助妈妈们恢复窈窕身姿。,"In order to satisfy the new mother's demand, it would provide the wound care in the beginning of confinement, bodybuilding care in the middle and later periods of confinement, Chinese traditional cosmetic treatment and other nursing items to help the new mother restore her graceful figure."
11483,在住的一位新妈妈告诉记者，她提前8个月才预定上了这家月子会所。,A new mother there told the reporter that she had booked this confinement service center 8 months in advance.
11484,月子会所的服务项目直接影响到产妇月子期间的舒适程度以及身体恢复情况，一些规模小的月子会所只能提供一些简单的月子服务，存在消毒卫生不规范、容易交叉感染，饮食单一不科学等问题隐患。,"The service items of confinement service center would directly impact the parturient's comfort and body recovery during the confinement. Some small confinement service centers could only provide some simple services during the confinement, but there were many problems and hidden troubles, including the irregular sterilization and sanitation, incidental cross infection, limited and unscientific diet, etc."
11485,这家月子中心的负责人说，他们是天津市所有五星级月子中心中，唯一一家获得B级服务认证的。,"The responsible person of this confinement center said that they were the only one five-star confinement center in Tianjin, which had been certified as a Grade B service provider."
11486,“虽然有些客户起初并不明白B级认证的含义，但通过认证倒逼企业严格标准化的流程管理，让客户受益，对企业长远发展具有重要意义 。 ”他说。,"""Some customers didn't understand the meaning of the Grade B certification at first, but the fact forcing the enterprises to strictly implement the standardized process management through certification will benefit the customers. It is important for the long-term development of enterprises. "" he said."
11487,国家市场监管总局认证监管司副司长潘丽芬说，服务认证是基于顾客感知、关注组织质量管理和服务特性满足程度的一种新型认证制度，是国家质量基础设施的重要组成部分，对提升优质服务供给比重、增强中国服务国际竞争力具有积极作用。,"Pan Lifen, the deputy director of the Attestation Supervision Department of the State Administration for Market Regulation, said that the service certification was a new kind of certification system, which was based on the customers' perception and focused on the organizational quality management and satisfaction of service characteristics. It was an important part of the national quality infrastructure, and had a positive effects on increasing the proportion of quality services and enhancing China's international service competitiveness."
11488,我国从2004年起步，经过10余年的发展，服务认证项目经历了从无到有，逐步发展的过程，涌现了如金融服务认证、母婴护理服务认证、商品售后服务认证、电子商务服务认证、保健服务认证等一批有一定影响力的服务认证。,"After more than 10 years of development since 2004, the service certification project in our country had gone through a process of developing from scratch. A series of influential service certification had appeared, including the financial service certification, mother and baby nursing service certification, after-sales service certification, electronic commerce service certification, and health care service certification."
11489,据国家市场监管总局统计，目前我国有服务认证机构130余家，服务认证人员两千余人，有效认证证书近八千张。,"According to the statistics of the State Administration for Market Regulation, there are more than 130 service certification institutions with over 2000 service certification staff and nearly 8000 valid authentication certificates at present in our country."
11490,潘丽芬表示，要进一步引导和推动服务认证的发展，在健康、教育、体育、金融、电商等领域逐步扩大服务认证覆盖面，助推服务业供给侧改革和质量提升。,"Pan Lifen said that it was necessary to further guide and promote the development of service certification, gradually extend the coverage of service certification in the fields of health, education, sports, finance and electronic commerce, and boost the supply-side reform and quality enhancement in the service industry."
11491,路透香港11月5日 - 香港楼价在见顶后连续两个月回落，香港金融管理局总裁陈德霖周一表示，现时尚需时间观察楼市是否已进入下行周期，假如确认，可以考虑适当时候陆续放松逆周期措施的收紧政策。,"Report of Reuters on November 5 in Hong Kong: the property price in Hong Kong fell for two consecutive months after peaking. Chen Delin, the president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said on Monday that it needed time to observe whether the property market had entered downturns. If confirmed, it can be considered to successively ease the tightening policy of counter-cyclical measures at an appropriate time."
11492,陈德霖并指，倘若楼价回调，首当其冲受影响的将会是在楼市高峰期时置业的人士，但预计出现如1997年亚洲金融风暴时的楼价急跌、市民大幅削价抛售物业的机会低很多。,"Chen Delin also pointed out that if the property price fell, the first to be affected would be those who bought properties at the peak of the property market, but it was expected that there would be less opportunities to occur the situation like sharply falling property prices and the properties substantially sold by the citizens during the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997."
11493,陈德霖率领多名金管局高层出席立法会简报会时表示，若确认楼市进入下跌周期，可以适当时陆续放松措施。,"When leading multiple senior leaders of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to attend the briefing session of the legislative session, Chen Delin said that if the property market was determined to enter downturns, the ease of measures can be made in succession at an appropriate time."
11494,“但现时只看到几个星期的数据 ，放松仍言之尚早，仍要多些时间去看楼市是否进入下行周期 。 ”,"""However, since data of a few weeks only can currently be seen, it's still too early to ease, and it needs more time to see whether the property market is entering downturns. """
11495,自2009年10以来，金管局至今已先后推出八轮逆周期措施，大幅收紧各类物业的按揭，包括降低按揭成数、按揭申请人须通过严谨的压力测试等，以提升银行风险管理及抗震能力。,"Since October 2009, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has successively launched eight rounds of counter-cyclical measures to substantially tighten the mortgages of various properties, including reduction of the number of mortgages, and that the mortgage applicants have to pass rigorous stress tests, in order to improve the bank risk management and shock resistance."
11496,随着香港正式进入加息周期，8-9月全港私人住宅楼价指数连续两个月见顶回落，9月份的按月跌幅更扩大至1.44 % 。,"As Hong Kong formally entered the interest-rate rise cycle, the house price index of private houses in Hong Kong peaked for two consecutive months in August and September and then fell, and the monthly decline in September even expanded to 1.44%."
11497,但今年前三季累积升幅仍达10.2 % 。,"However, the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of this year was still 10.2%."
11498,据金管局数据，量度香港面对金融风险的抗震能力的家庭财务状况仍然健康，今年第二季，香港家庭无按揭的自住居所住户比率达66 % ， 比2009-11年平均的60%为高；新批出按揭平均按揭成数及新批出按揭的供款与入息比率分别为47%及34 % ， 较2009-11年分别64%及41%均有明显改善。,"According to the data of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the household financial conditions for the ability of Hong Kong to withstand financial risks were measured to be healthy. In the second quarter this year, the percentage of households of self-occupation non-mortgage residence in Hong Kong was 66%, which was higher than the average of 60% in 2009-2011; the average loan-to-value ratio of the newly approved mortgage and the percentage of contribution and income of the newly approved mortgage was 47% and 34% respectively, with obvious improvement compared with 64% and 41% in 2009-2011."
11499,但陈德霖表示，抗震能力高不代表已置业市民不会受到经济下行的损害，因为物业估值会下跌，在高峰期买楼的人士更将首当其冲。,"However, Chen Delin said that high shock resistance didn’t mean the citizens who had bought properties wouldn’t be suffered damage of financial downturns, since the property valuation would fall, and those who bought properties at peak times would be the first to be affected."
11500,虽然金管局收紧银行对按揭贷款人的借贷，但置业人士亦可以通过按揭保险或由发展商提供按揭贷款等方式，获得高成数的按揭借贷。,"Although the Hong Kong Monetary Authority tightened the lending of the bank to the mortgage borrowers, those who bought properties can also get a high-percentage mortgage loan by means of the mortgage insurance, the mortgage loan provided by the developer and so on."
11501,陈德霖表示，现时连同向发展商提供的按揭借款，借款人按揭成数可达85-90 % ， 假如楼价下跌一成，就会出现负资产（即物业市值跌至低于未偿还按揭贷款总额的水平 ） 。,"Chen Delin said that currently together with the mortgage loan provided by the developer, the mortgage percentage of the borrower can reach 85-90%. If the property price fell by 10%, there would be negative assets (i.e. the market value of the property fell below the level of the total outstanding mortgage loan)."
11502,不过，金管局副总裁阮国恒指出，当局估计由发展商提供高成数的按揭总量，只占银行按揭总量的2-2.5 % ， 比例仍较低。,"However, Ruan Guoheng, the vice president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority pointed out that the Authority estimated the total high-percentage mortgage loan provided by the developer to account for 2-2.5% of the total mortgage of the bank, with lower proportion."
11503,2003年香港负资产高峰期时，负资产宗数超过10万宗，占供楼人士比例22 % 。,"At the peak time of negative assets in Hong Kong in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, with proportion of 22% in those who took mortgage."
11504,而截至今年第三季，香港连续七季录得零宗负资产。,"As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative asset for seven consecutive quarters."
11505,新华社北京10月1日电(刘红霞、马睿)电子商务零售出口企业10月1日迎来又一波税负利好，涉及增值税、消费税免税等方面。,"Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 1 (reported by Liu Hongxia &amp; Ma Rui) -- The electronic commerce retail export enterprises received another benefits in the aspect of tax burden on October 1st, concerning value-added tax and consumption tax exemption, etc."

11512,通知指出，具体免税管理办法由省级税务部门商财政、商务部门制定。,"According to the notification, the specific tax exemption management measures would be formulated by the provincial tax departments and commercial departments."
11513,各综试区建设领导小组办公室和商务主管部门应统筹推进部门之间的沟通协作和相关政策落实，加快建立电子商务出口统计监测体系，促进跨境电子商务健康快速发展。,"The construction leading group offices of the comprehensive pilot regions and departments of commercial administration should coordinate and promote the communication and collaboration between departments and the implementation of policies, accelerate the establishment of the statistical monitoring system of electronic commerce export, and promote the sound and rapid development of cross-boarder electronic commerce."
11514,中新网鄂尔多斯11月5日电 (张林虎)因钱财分配产生分歧，辽宁省一男子竟将情人杀害并抛尸，随后潜逃至内蒙古自治区。,"Report on November 5 of China News in Erdos (Zhang Linhu): A male of Liaoning Province killed his lover and dumped the body, and then fled to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region due to differences of opinions on the distribution of money."
11515,5日，记者从内蒙古鄂尔多斯市东胜区公安局获悉，经过两地警方联合调查，该男子被成功抓获。,"On Day 5, the reporter learned from the Public Security Bureau of Dongsheng, Erdos, Inner Mongolia, that the man was successfully captured after the joint investigation of Liaoning and Erdos police."
11516,2018年6月26日，辽宁省鞍山市一女性失踪，家属向当地警方报警。,"On June 26, 2018, a female of Anshan, Liaoning disappeared and her family members reported this case to local police."
11517,经警方调查研判，这不是一起简单的人口失踪案件，失踪者白某极有可能被情人王某所杀害，警方随即成立专案组进行进一步侦查。,"Upon the investigation and judgment of the police, this was not a simple case of missing persons. The missing person Ms Bai was likely to be killed by her lover Mr Wang. And then the police set up a special investigating team for further investigation."
11518,10月30日，专案组发现犯罪嫌疑人王某可能藏匿到鄂尔多斯市东胜区，东胜警方当即组织精干警力全力配合辽宁警方侦破案件。,"On October 30, the special investigating team found that the suspect Mr Wang might hide in Dongsheng, Erdos. The Dongsheng police immediately organized capable police force to fully cooperate with Liaoning police to detect the case."
11519,经过5天侦查，民警终于摸清了王某的落脚点，并对其关系人进行了详细梳理。,"After five days of investigation, the police finally found out Mr Wang's foothold, and teased out his contacts in detail."
11520,11月4日，两地警方合力在东胜区某挖机配件店内将犯罪嫌疑人王某抓获。,"On November 4, Liaoning and Erdos police jointly captured Liaoning and Erdos police in a excavator accessory store in Dongsheng."
11521,据王某交代，他与受害人白某系情人关系，因白某的姐姐有一笔大额资金在白某名下暂存，二人决定将这笔钱占为己有。,"Mr Wang said that the victim Ms Bai and him are lovers. Since Ms Bai's sister temporarily kept a large amount of money under Ms Bai's name, they decided to hold the money as their own."
11522,2018年6月22日，王某与白某因对支配该笔资金产生分歧，王某进而将白某在出租屋内杀害，将尸体分解后抛尸。,"On June 22, 2018, Mr Wang killed Ms Bai in the renting room, disassembled the body and dumped it since they had differences of opinions on the distribution of money."
11523,目前，犯罪嫌疑人王某已被移交辽宁鞍山警方。,"Currently, the suspect Mr Wang has been handed over to the police of Anshan, Liaoning."

11531,中新网深圳10月1日电(郑小红 徐殿伟 刘姝梦)10月1日为内地国庆“黄金周”首日，也是香港国庆公众假期的最后一天，许多内地居民利用假期出国境游玩、购物，也有许多来深的香港居民当日返港，深圳各口岸出现客流“爆棚”的情况，罗湖、深圳湾口岸新启用22条自助通道，提升口岸通关效率，便利旅客高效快捷通关。,"ECNS, Shenzhen, October 1 (reported by Zheng Xiaohong, Xu Dianwei &amp; Liu Shumeng) -- It was the first day of the National Day ""Golden Week"" in the mainland on October 1. And it was also the last day of the National Day public holiday in Hong Kong. Many mainland residents used this holiday to travel and go shopping across the border, while many Hong Kong residents returned to Hong Kong after visiting Shenzhen. The passenger volume of Shenzhen ports was ""full to bursting"", and the ports in Luohu and Shenzhen Bay had newly opened 22 automated gateways. This would improve the clearance efficiency in ports and facilitate the passengers to be cleared by the customs effectively and rapidly."
11532,据深圳边检总站提供的数据，截至当日下午16时，深圳口岸出入境人数达42.9万余人次，交通运输工具数量达1.68万余辆(艘、架、列)次，各口岸始终忙而不乱，保持了良好的出入境秩序。,"According to the data provided by Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection, over 4290000 people and over 168000 vehicles had been transported across the boarder by 16:00 that afternoon. The ports had always been busy and orderly with a good order of entry and exit."
11533,据了解，受为中国公民提供出境免签政策的国家增多等诸多利好因素影响，利用国庆假期前往欧洲及东南亚等国度假购物的旅客持续增加。,"It was learned that there were an increasing number of passengers taking advantage of the National Day holiday to visit the countries in Europe and Southeast Asia to go shopping affected by many positive factors, such as there were more countries providing the visa-free policy for the Chinese citizens."
11534,1日一早，罗湖、深圳湾、皇岗、福田等口岸出境方向便迎来客(车)流高峰，其中罗湖口岸客流高峰从早上9:00持续至上午11:00，深圳湾口岸客(车)流高峰从上午6:30至中午13:00。,"The passenger (car) flow peak in the exit direction in the ports in Luohu, Shenzhen Bay, Huanggang, and Futian occurred in the morning of October 1. The passenger flow peak in Luohu port lasted from 9:00 am to 11:00 am, and the passenger (car) flow peak in Shenzhen Bay port lasted from 6:30 am to the noon at 13:00."
11535,据介绍，为应对出入境客(车)流高峰，深圳边检总站按照国家移民管理局统一部署，启动客(车)流高峰时段勤务模式，安排加班警力支援执勤一线，提前开足查验通道，引导旅客、车辆有序候检，确保中国公民出入境通关排队不超过30分钟，同时兼顾外国人通关效率；加强人流密集区域的秩序维护，确保通关安全有序。,"According to the introduction, in order to cope with passenger (car) flow peak across the boarder, Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection followed the unified deployment of the State Immigration Administration to start the service mode of passenger (car) flow peak period, arrange the policemen to work overtime to support those working in the front-line on duty, open enough passages for inspection and examination in advance, ensure that the queueing time of Chinese citizen's exit and entry would not exceed 30 minutes while taking into account of the foreigner's clearance efficiency; the order maintenance in the crowded was enhanced, and the customs clearance was ensured to be safe and orderly."
11536,深圳边检总站同时提醒出入境旅客，出行前应注意证件及签证、签注的有效期，合理安排行程，尽量避开客流高峰时段，选择合适时间、合适口岸出行。,"Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection also reminded the travelers across the boarder to pay attention to the expiry dates of their certificates, visas, and endorsements before their trips, make the travel arrangement in a reasonable way, try to avoid the passenger flow peak period and choose a right time and a right port to travel."
11537,乘坐广深港高铁前往香港的旅客须持有效出入境证件和签证签注，高铁票仅为乘车凭证，不能作为出入境证件，如因证件手续不符等原因不能出境前往香港的，应遵循边检执勤民警指引，到指定地点等候港铁公司工作人员引带办理返回内地的乘车手续。,"The passengers headed for Hong Kong via Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link must take their valid exit &amp; entry documents, visas and endorsements. The high-speed rail ticket could be used as a proof of payment only, but not the exit and entry certificate. Anyone, who couldn't go to Hong Kong across the boarder due to the reasons such as the documents and procedures were not satisfiable, should follow the guide of the policeman on duty in the Frontier Inspection, and go to the designated site to wait for the staff of MTR corporation to guide them to go through the procedures of returning the mainland by train."
11538,系统性红斑狼疮是一种累及全身多脏器的慢性疑难病，过去曾被认为是“不治之症 ” 。,"Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic and stubborn disease involving multiple organs of the body. It used to be considered as an ""incurable disease""."
11539,因其发病机制不明，诊治疑难，缺乏有效的治疗方法而不得根治。,"Because its pathogenesis is unknown, diagnosis and treatment are difficult, and there is lack of effective treatment, it is hard to cure once and for all."
11540,近日，清华大学生命科学学院研究员刘万里和北京大学人民医院风湿免疫中心主任栗占国联合团队发现了人类免疫球蛋白存在增加系统性红斑狼疮易感性的分子变异，且这种变异参与调控免疫性B细胞。,"Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at the School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, and Li Zhanguo, director of the Rheumatism and Immunity Center at Peking University People’s Hospital, together with their teams discovered the existence of human immune globulin can increase the molecular variation of systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility, and this kind of variation is involved in the regulation of immune B cells."
11541,简而言之，两团队证实了人体内一种异常的免疫分子是引起系统性红斑狼疮发病的重要原因。,"In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of the onset of systemic lupus erythematosus."
11542,据文章作者之一、北大人民医院孙晓麟介绍，栗占国团队搜集了近2000例大样本的系统性红斑狼疮患者并进行研究，发现出现免疫球蛋白变异的患者体内产生了致病细胞和种类广、数量多的自身抗体，肾炎、关节炎、浆膜炎、血管炎等炎症的发生率和严重程度显著增加。,"According to Sun Xiaolin, one of the authors and member of Peking University People’s Hospital, the team of Li Zhanguo collected nearly 2,000 large samples of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus to make study. It was found that patients with immune globulin variations produced pathopoiesis cells and a wide variety of numerous autoantibodies. The incidence and severity of nephritis, arthritis, orrhomeningitis vasculitis and other inflammations are significantly increased."
11543,刘万里团队通过免疫细胞示踪、动物试验、测序等多种研究方法，发现这种免疫分子变异激活的免疫信号通路、促进B细胞分泌多种自身抗体的致病机制。,"Through various research methods such as immune cell tracing, animal testing, and sequencing, Liu Wanli team found that the immune molecule variation activates the immune signaling pathway and the pathogenic mechanism of promoting B cells secreting various autoantibodies."
11544,记者了解到，两团队强强联合，充分发挥各自优势，实现了基础研究与临床应用的紧密结合。,The reporter learned that the powerful combination between two teams gave full play to their respective advantages and achieved a close integration between basic research and clinical application.
11545,刘万里团队致力于B淋巴细胞免疫识别、免疫活化研究，栗占国团队则长期从事系统性红斑狼疮的临床研究。,"Liu Wanli team is committed to B lymphocyte immune recognition and immune activation research, and the Li Zhanguo team has long been engaged in clinical research on systemic lupus erythematosus."
11546,“这项研究是两个团队多年合作的成果之一，也是学术界首次在机制上认识到免疫球蛋白基因异常将会诱发系统性红斑狼疮，为进一步学术研究及临床的靶向治疗奠定了坚实基础 。 ”,"""This research is one of the results of years of cooperation between the two teams. It is also the first time in the academic community to recognize that immune globulin gene abnormalities will induce systemic lupus erythematosus, which lays a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted therapy. """
11547,这并非护短，而是依法办事。,"This is not shield mistakes, but acting by law."
11548,律师携带斧头上法院开庭？,Lawyers took an axe to the court?
11549,该消息乍一听确实很刺激，也在法律圈炸开了锅。,"The news was really exciting at first glance, and it also caused a great disturbance in the legal circle."
11550,福建泉州市中法随后对涉事律师罚款500元，并书面建议泉州市律师协会进行调查处理。,Fujian Quanzhou Intermediate People’s Court subsequently fined the lawyers for 500 yuan and proposed in writing to the Quanzhou Lawyers Association to investigate and handle.
11551,而据新京报报道，日前泉州市律协发布正式通报称，两位律师的行为不涉及违法违规，依法不予处罚。,"According to the Beijing News, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association issued a formal notice that the behaviors of the two lawyers did not involve violations of laws and regulations and were not punished according to law."
11552,从多方报道看，泉州市律协的处理并非护短或搞对抗，而是得到了泉州中院的认可。,"According to the multi-party reports, the handling of the Quanzhou Lawyers Association is not a shortcomings protection or confrontation, but has been approved by the Quanzhou Intermediate People’s Court."
11553,一起原本可能引发法律共同体内部紧张的事件，最终得到妥善解决。,An event that could have caused tension within the legal community was eventually resolved properly.
11554,事情的逆转，源于更完整的真相还原：涉事律师携带的斧头与被告人的凶器同款式、同型号，但未开刃，仅在举证质证环节作辅助证据，并无恐吓举动或“危及法庭安全”的主观意图。,"The reversal of the event stems from the more completed truth restoring: the axe carried by the lawyer involved is the same type and same model as the defendant’s weapon, but it is not put the first edge. It only serves as secondary evidence in the evidence-proven and cross-examination link, and there is no threatening acts or the subject intention of ""endangering the court security""."
11555,判断涉事律师的行为是否违法违规，有四个非常重要的细节需要关注：其一，当地法院此前两次开庭，仅出示了斧头照片，从辩护角度看，出示斧头原物有其必要性；其二，斧头是在开庭前1个小时才去购买，并非律师不愿寻求法官同意，而是客观上没能联系到法官；其三，整个斧头没有被过激或不当使用；其四，涉事律师第一时间公开认错，并向法院表达了歉意。,"Judging whether the behaviors of the lawyers involved is illegal or not, there are four very important details to be concerned. First, the local court has twice held the court and only showed a photo of the axe. From the perspective of defense, it is necessary to show the original axe. Second, the axe is purchased one hour before the court open. It is not that the lawyer is not willing to seek the judge’s consent, but it is not able to contact the judge objectively. Third, the axe has not been used in an excessive or improper manner. Fourth, the lawyers admitted the mistake in public and immediately apologized to the court."
11556,综合这些情节，可以看出涉事律师“带斧出庭”无关作歹，只是为了辩护。,"Based on these plots, it can be seen that the lawyers who ""took axe to appear in court"" have nothing to do the devil things, but just to make defense."
11557,在厘清整个事实经过后，泉州市律协没有顺水推舟，而是顶住压力做出了不予处罚的决定。,"After clarifying the whole facts, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association did not follow the societal discussion, but resisted the pressure and made a decision not to impose penalties."
11558,而这一决定，也经得起事实和法律的检验。,And this decision can withstand the test of facts and laws.
11559,至于未经法院许可，将作为管制刀具的斧头带至法庭，确实容易引发不安和误解。,"As taking the axe as the controlled knife to the court without the permission of the court, it is easy to cause anxiety and misunderstanding."
11560,出于安全和谨慎考虑，泉州中院此前的罚款处罚和司法建议也无可厚非。,"For the sake of safety and cautious, Quanzhou Intermediate People’s Court’s previous fine punishment and judicial advice are also understandable."
11561,为了维护律师尊严，防止个别法院借故刁难律师，最高法于2014年发布了《人民法院司法警察安全检查规则 》 ， 确立了律师出庭不需要进行人身安全检查的原则。,"In order to maintain the dignity of lawyers and prevent several courts from finding excuses to purposely make difficulties for lawyers, the Supreme Law promulgated the ""Rules on Security Checks by Judicial Policemen of the People’s Courts"" in 2014, establishing the principles that lawyers do not need to conduct personal security check in court."
11562,该规则发布以来，广大律师以身作则，很少发生因安检漏洞从而危害法庭安全的事件。,"Since the issuance of the Rule, lawyers have set examples, and there have been few incidents endangering the court security happened due to the omissions of security checks."
11563,在类似泉州这样的极个别事例中，只要本着互相尊重、理解的精神进行沟通，误解不难消除。,"In such a very rare case happened in Quanzhou, as long as we communicate in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding, misunderstanding is not difficult to eliminate."
11564,律师协会作为律师行业的自律组织，承担着惩戒不法和保障合法的双重使命。,"As a self-regulatory organization in the lawyer profession, the Lawyers Association bears the dual mission of disciplining against law and safeguard the legitimate rights."
11565,以往个别律协组织因偏重于惩戒，失之于保障，备受诟病。,"In the past, individual Lawyers Association organizations have been blamed for their emphasis on disciplinary action and their loss of safeguard."
11566,而泉州律协的决定，无论从过程还是结果看，都值得称赞，为更多的律协正确履职树立了榜样。,"The decision of the Quanzhou Lawyers Association is worthy of praise both in terms of process and results, and it sets an example for more lawyers association to perform their duties correctly."
11567,10月1日起， 哪些个税利好将影响我们的钱袋子？,Which tax benefits will affect our money bag from October 1?
11568,新华社上海10月1日电(记者 桑彤)新个人所得税法将于2019年1月1日起施行，为了让广大人民群众尽早享受减税红利，从10月1日起，将先行对纳税人实际取得的工资薪金所得按每月5000元的起征点进行扣除，并适用新税率表。,"Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 1 (reported by Sang Tong) -- The New Individual Income Tax Law will be implemented from January 1, 2019. In order to have the broad masses of the people enjoy the benefits of tax reduction as soon as possible, the tax will firstly be deducted from taxpayers' actual job salaries based on the minimum threshold of 5000 yuan per month from October 1, 2019, and the new tax rate schedule will be applied."
11569,伴随着新政落地，究竟有哪些利好会影响到群众的钱袋子呢？,"With the implementation of new policy, which benefits will really affect the people's money bag?"
11570,利好一：工资薪金所得减税幅度明显,The first benefit: the income tax will be reduced significantly in the job salaries.
11571,10月1日后取得工资薪金的纳税人，可以扣除5000元/月的基本减除费用并适用新税率表，大部分纳税人都有不同程度的减税，特别是中低收入者减税幅度更为明显。,"The taxpayer receiving the job salaries after October 1 can have the basic deduction of fees deducted based on the threshold of 5000 yuan per month, and the new tax rate schedule will be applied. Most of the taxpayers will enjoy different levels of tax reduction, especially the lower and middle-income people, who will see more significant tax reduction."
11572,根据不同收入群体的减税情况表显示，扣除“三险一金”后的月收入额8000元、10000元、20000元、50000元的人，税改后应纳税额分别为90元、290元、1590元、9090元，与月起征点3500元相比，对应的减税比例分别是73.9 % 、 61.1 % 、 49.0 % 、 18.8 % 。,"According to the tax reduction fact sheet of different income groups, for the people whose monthly income will be 8000 yuan, 10000 yuan, 20000 yuan, and 50000 yuan after deducting the ""three insurances and one fund"", the taxable amounts after the tax reform will be 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 1590 yuan, and 9090 yuan respectively. Compared with the monthly threshold of 3500 yuan, the corresponding tax reduction ratio is 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.0%, 18.8% respectively."
11573,值得注意的是，因节假日原因，各单位在9月底依法发放的本应于10月份发放的工资，可以适用新的基本减除费用和税率表。,"It is worth noting that due to holidays, the new basic deduction of fees and tax rate schedule can be applied to the salaries that should be paid by the units in October but have been paid at the end of September according to laws."
11574,为此，税务部门统一推广使用的扣缴客户端软件已提供了相应税款计算功能，但相应税款仍需在法定申报期内申报缴纳。,"For this purpose, the withholding client software, which is uniformly promoted and used by the tax department, has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax still needs to be declared and paid during the statutory declaration period."
11575,利好二：低税率档级距明显拉大,The second benefit: the gaps between grades of low tax rates will be obviously widened.
11576,除了提高起征点外，10月1日起将适用新的税率表。,"In addition to raising the threshold, the new tax rate schedule will be applied from October 1."
11577,本次工资、薪金所得的七档税率和以前一致，没有变化，但是税率级距有了明显的变化，3 % 、 10 % 、 20%三档低税率的级距明显扩大，25%的税率级距有所缩小，而30 % 、 35 % 、 45%这三档较高税率的级距保持不变。,"This time, seven grades of tax rates of job salaries are the same as before without any changes, but the gaps between grades of tax rates are obviously changed. The gaps between three grades of low tax rates in 3%, 10% and 20% are obviously widened, the gap of the grade of tax rate in 25% is slightly narrowed, but the gaps between three grades of high tax rates in 30%, 35% and 45% are the same as before."
11578,值得注意的是，税法还调整了生产经营所得各档税率，其中最高档35%税率的下限从10万元提高至50万元。,"It is worth noting that the tax law has also adjusted the grades of tax rates for income from production and business operation, and the lower limit of the highest grade of tax rate in 35% has been increased from 0.1 million yuan to 0.5 million yuan."
11579,这意味着个体工商户、个人独资合伙企业都将从税改中受益。,This means that the individual businesses and personal exclusive investment enterprises will benefit from this tax reform.

On the edge of the vast Yangcheng Lake, watch the egrets prey, enjoy the sunset, experience the fun of catching crabs, and enjoy the slow-paced water town life."

11601,和大闸蟹打交道近20年的蟹农常建华正计划把阳澄湖大闸蟹的蟹苗和养殖技术出口到泰国，让水乡美食跨越国界，促进与海外美食的文化交流。,"Crab farmer Chang Jianhua, who has been in hairy crabs industry for nearly 20 years, is planning to export the seedlings and breeding techniques of Yangcheng Lake hairy crabs to Thailand, so that the waterside foods can cross national borders and promote cultural exchanges with overseas cuisine."

11610,此前，加拿大CTV News电视台援引美国高级消息人士的话称，加拿大和美国消除了分歧并就北美自贸协定(NAFTA)达成协议。,The CTV News Channel in Canada previously quoted the message from the United States senior source saying that Canada and the United States had settled differences and concluded an agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

Denny Tamaki, who opposed the plan of relocating the US military base in Japan, was elected successfully."

11619,玉城1日向媒体表示，选举结果表明县民们不想让翁长知事生前的努力白费，他将继承翁长知事遗志，继续就反对美军基地搬迁计划和普天间基地的关闭等向日本政府和美国政府作出努力。,"Tamaki told the media on October 1 that the result of election showed that the Okinawa people didn't want to waste the former governor Onaga Takeshi's efforts during his lifetime, and he would carry out Takeshi's behests to make continued efforts in opposing the plan of relocating the US military base and the closure of the Futenma base to the Japanese government and the American government."
11620,普天间美军基地位于冲绳县宜野湾市，一直以来饱受诟病，日美政府此前同意将其搬迁至名护市的边野古地区，但冲绳民众强烈反对，希望能将基地彻底迁出冲绳。,"The Futenma base is located in Ginowan in Okinawa Prefecture, and it has been criticized all the time. The Japanese government and the American government have agreed to relocate it to Henoko in Nago, but the Okinawa people strongly oppose this action and hope to move the base completely out of Okinawa."
11621,而对于县民们强烈反对的搬迁计划以及撤销边野古沿岸填海造地许可的要求，玉城表示，他一开始也没有和中央政府站在对立和分裂的立场，希望双方能充分交换意见，显示了通过协商解决的意向。,"For the relocation plan strongly opposed by Okinawa people and the request to cancel the permit for land reclamation along the coast of Henoko, Tamaki said that he didn't stand on the opposite and divisive ground against the central government at the beginning. He hoped that both sides could fully exchange views, show the intention to solve the problems through negotiation."
11622,日本首相安倍晋三1日上午也向媒体表示 ， 认真接受这一结果，并将就振兴冲绳和减轻基地负担等作出努力。,Japanese President Shinzo Abe also told the media in the morning of October 1 that he would seriously accept this result and make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and reduce the burden on the base.
11623,日本官房长官菅义伟在1日的记者会上表示，政府关于尽快搬迁美军基地的方针没有发生任何改变。,"Yoshihide Suga, the Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan, said in the press conference on October 1 that the government's policy of relocating the US base as soon as possible had not been changed at all."

11625,玉城将于本月4日正式就任冲绳县知事。,Tamaki will officially take up his duties as the governor of Okinawa.
11626,自2000年代中期以来，随着中国对于油籽需求的增长，美国北达科他州农民Paul Thomas在他的地里种植越来越多的大豆。,"Since the mid-2000s, with China’s increasing needs for oilseeds, Paul Thomas, a farmer in North Dakota, has grown more and more soybeans in his field."
11627,"这一转变在今年达到最高峰，他在5,000英亩地里种了1,600英亩的大豆，达到了前所未见的规模。","This transition reaches the peak this year. He has grown 1,600 acres of soybeans in the 5,000-acre land, reaching an unprecedented scale"
11628,但Thomas和很多像他一样的农民计划在2019年转种以前美国农业区的主食作物：玉米和小麦。,"However, in 2019, Thomas and many farmers like him plan to switch production to the staple crops in the former U.S. agricultural region, such as corn and wheat."
11629,美国农民今年的大豆种植面积超过了玉米，为35年以来首次。,"The area of soybeans grown by American farmers exceeds that of corn this year, which is for the first time in 35 years."
11630,之所以计划转种其他粮食作物，是因为在美国总统特朗普对中国发起贸易战的背景下，美国农民们出售大豆面临困境。,The reason why the farmers plan to switch production to other crops is that American farmers face difficulties in selling soybeans in the context of the trade war launched by President Trump against China.
11631,中国通常购买约60%的美国出口大豆，但因为贸易战，近几个月几乎零购买美国大豆，导致大豆价格跌至十年低位。,"China usually purchases around 60% of soybeans exported from America, but because of the trade war, the purchases of American soybeans are nearly zero in recent months, leading to a 10-year low in soybean prices."
11632,Thomas打算明年种更多小麦，希望通过降低对有赖中国需求的作物的依赖，可以多赚一些。,Thomas plans to grow more wheats next year and hopes to earn more by reducing dependence on crops that rely on Chinese demands.
11633,Thomas表示，大豆价格“给我们带来沉痛的打击 ” 。,"Thomas said that the soybean price ""brings us a heavy blow""."
11634,他表示，没有了中国买需，其农场附近的大豆现货价格是每蒲式耳7.10美元，而覆盖成本所必需的价格是8.50美元。,"He said that the spot price of soybeans near his farm was $7.10 per bushel without Chinese demands, while the price needed for covering costs was $8.50."
11635,美国农户今年大豆种植面积创下纪录高位，收成亦有望创下纪录高位。,The area of soybeans grown by American farmers hits a high record and the harvest is expected to hit a high record.
11636,就在这样一个很容易受到冲击的时刻，他们遇到了贸易战的打击。,"At such a vulnerable time, they are hit by the trade war."
11637,针对特朗普对进口中国商品加征关税，中国在7月对进口美国大豆加征进口关税。,"As Trump imposed tariffs on the goods imported from China, China imposes tariffs on the soybeans imported from America in July."
11638,美国农业部将发布对明年种植面积的首次预估报告，料将包含对关税影响的考量。,"The United States Department of Agriculture will release the first estimated report of cultivated area next year, which is expected to include consideration of tariff effects."
11639,预计该预估将确认民间机构对大豆播种面积将减少的预期。,This estimate is expected to confirm the expectations of non-governmental organizations that the cultivated area of soybeans will be reduced.
11640,"据路透看到的一份报告，Informa Economics在10月19日预计，2019年玉米种植面积将增加4%至9,270万英亩(3,750万公顷 ) ， 大豆种植面积将减少7%至8,300万英亩。","According to a report seen by Reuters, on October 19, Informa Economics predicted that the cultivated area of corns would increase by 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) and the cultivated area of soybeans would decrease by 7% to 83 million acres in 2019."
11641,Informa还预计美国小麦种植面积将增加4 % 。,Informa also predicted that the cultivated area of wheats in America would increase by 4%.
11642,"在实施报复性关税前种植的大豆面积今年升至8,960万英亩，较10年前高出约1,500万英亩。","The cultivated area of soybeans increases to 89.6 million acres this year before retaliatory tariffs are implemented, which is about 15 million acres higher than that of 10 years ago."
11643,"玉米种植面积自2008年以来增加不到500万英亩，至8,910万英亩，今年小麦种植面积为4,780万英亩，接近100年来最低水准。","The cultivated area of corns has increased by less than 5 million acres to 89.1 million acres since 2008. The cultivated area of wheats is 47.8 million acres this year, which is close to the lowest level in 100 years."
11644,"伊利诺伊州玉米种植协会会长Aron Carlson自家的总种植面积为3,600英亩，今年他将近一半用于种植大豆，但计划未来有所削减。","The total cultivated area of the president of Illinois Corn Growers Association Aron Carlson’s family is 3,600 acres. He uses nearly half of the land to grow soybeans, but he plans to make reduction in the future."
11645,他称，可能在他位于伊利诺伊州北部的农场将玉米种植面积最多增加20 % ； 该州是美国最大的大豆种植州。,He said that the cultivated area of corns in the farm in North Illinois would increase by 20% at most; this state is the largest soybean cultivation state in America.
11646,大豆每英亩单产低于玉米，但需要的化肥也少，这使大豆总体来说种植成本较低。,"The yields per acre of soybeans are lower than that of corns, but less fertilizer is needed, which makes the cost of soybean cultivation relatively low as a whole."
11647,如果农户转至终值玉米，可能将提高成本，但将使包括Andersons Inc化肥销售商在内的一些企业受益。,"If farmers switch production to corns, the cost may increase. But the fertilizer seller of Andersons Inc and other enterprises may benefit from it."
11648,Andersons执行长Pat Bowe对路透表示，他预计转种玉米将有利于化肥使用。,"Pat Bowe, the CEO of Andersons said to Reuters that he predicted that switching production to corns would be beneficial to fertilizer use."
11649,拜耳也预计将因农户转种玉米而受益。,Bayer also predicts to benefit from farmers switching production to corns.

11660,在单边主义逆流涌动的当下，国际规则和多边秩序遭受冲击。,"Under the circumstance of unilateralism adverse current surging, international rules and multilateral order have been impacted."
11661,某种程度上，单边主义与多边主义的交锋进入关键时期。,"To some extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered into a critical period."
11662,作为负责任大国，中国以顺大势、合大道的理念和扎实有力的行动，与国际社会一道共同维护多边主义，推动多边主义不断前行。,"As a responsible great power, China has taken the idea of following the general tendency and corresponding with major principles and the action with solid and power to maintain multilateralism with the international community and promote multilateralism going ahead continuously."
11663,面对新形势新挑战，中国就多边主义的发展方向和路径发出响亮声音。,"Facing the new situations and new challenges, China has issued a loud voice on the development direction and path of multilateralism."
11664,正如国务委员兼外交部长王毅在第73届联合国大会一般性辩论演讲中所说，新时代的多边主义应该坚持以合作共赢为目标，以规则秩序为基础，以公平正义为要旨，以有效行动为导向。,"As Wang Yi, State Councilor and Foreign Minister, stated at the General Debate of the 73rd Session of the UN General Assembly that multilateralism in the new era should pursue the goal of win-win cooperation, act upon rules and order, uphold fairness and justice, and act to deliver real results."
11665,同时，中国呼吁构建以联合国为核心、南北合作为主渠道、南南合作为补充的全球发展合作格局，呼吁各方同心协力构建人类命运共同体。,"At the same time, China calls for the establishment of a global development cooperation of making the United Nations as the core, North-South cooperation as the main channel and South-South cooperation as the complement, and calls on all parties to work together to build a community with shared future for mankind."
11666,中国的思考和呼声，反映了国际社会的主流声音。,China’s thought and voice reflect the mainstream of the international community.
11667,诚如第73届联大主席埃斯皮诺萨所说，在当前形势下 ， “ 联合国比任何时候都需要弘扬多边主义，维护基于规则的国际体系 ” 。,"As the President of the 73rd United Nations General Assembly Espinosa said, under the current situation, ""the United Nations needs to develop and expand multilateralism and maintain a rules-based international system more than ever""."
11668,国际货币基金组织总裁拉加德表示，国际社会应当继续坚定维护多边贸易体系，坚持国际贸易规则，通过协商解决分歧。,"Lagarde, President of International Monetary Fund, said that the international community should continue to firmly uphold the multilateral trading system, adhere to international trade rules, and resolve differences through consultation."
11669,近年来，伴随全球经济政治力量对比的调整，一些新兴市场和发展中国家群体崛起，在国际主要多边机制中发挥更大作用，为遭遇逆风的多边主义提供新的发展动力。,"In recent years, as the changes of global economy and political power balance, some newly-developing markets and developing countries have emerged in groups, playing a greater role in the major international multilateral mechanisms, and providing new development impetus for the multilateralism that has suffered from the headwinds."
11670,站在这个维度考量，中国倡导的建设大家庭而不是拼凑小圈子、坚持共商共建而不是搞赢者通吃等多边主义理念，顺应时代潮流，是应对全球挑战、解决世界难题的必然选择，代表了世界上大多数国家的共同诉求。,"Thinking in this dimension,building a big family but not making up small circles, adhering to discussion and collaboration but not winner-take-all and other the multilateralism ideas advocated by China follow the trend of the times, they are the inevitable choices to cope with global challenges and solve world problems, representing the common pursuit of the majority countries around the world."
11671,有先进的理念，更有扎实的行动。,Advanced idea with more solid action.
11672,中国提出的“一带一路”倡议，已成为规模最大的国际合作平台。,"China’s ""One Belt One Road"" has become the largest international cooperation platform."
11673,中国发起的共建“一带一路 ” 、 亚洲基础设施投资银行 、 “ 16＋1合作”等国际和地区合作倡议，促进国际地区合作，完善补充现有国际制度和秩序，为多边主义合作带来创新活力，为推动国际秩序朝着更加公正合理方向发展作出贡献。,"""One Belt One Road"", Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, ""16+1 Cooperation"" and other international and regional cooperation initiatives launched by China promote international cooperation, improve existing international systems and order, and bring innovation vitality to multilateral cooperation and make contribution to the development of the international order in a more just and rational direction."
11674,作为国际秩序的维护者和多边主义的践行者，在联合国这一多边舞台上，中国的行动越来越有力。,"As the defender of the international order and the practitioner of multilateralism, China’s actions are becoming more and more powerful in the multilateral stage of the United Nations."
11675,斡旋国际热点、应对气候变化、参与维和行动、大力减贫扶贫、助力其他国家落实2030年可持续发展议程。,"Mediate heated-discussion international points, address climate changes, participate in peacekeeping operations, vigorously reduce poverty and help the poor, and help other countries implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development."
11676,正如联合国秘书长古特雷斯所说，中国已经成为多边主义的重要支柱。,"As United Nations Secretary-General, Guterres said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism."
11677,当世界面临的“信任赤字”加剧，当民粹主义和极化趋势抬头，正是世界对多边合作需求最为迫切的时刻。,"When the ""trust deficit"" faced by the world intensifies, when Populism and polarization trends are on the rise, it is the most urgent moment that the world needs multilateral cooperation."
11678,在这样的历史关口，国际社会需要携起手来，将共识化为行动，坚决捍卫多边主义，共同推动构建人类命运共同体。,"At such a historical juncture, the international community needs to join hands to turn consensus into actions, resolutely defend multilateralism, and jointly promote the building of community with shared future for mankind."

11693,“不忘历史才能开辟未来 。 ”,"""Only by remembering history can we open up the future. """

11695,快评指出，英烈是民族的脊梁。,The quick comment has pointed out that heroes are the backbone of the nation.

11712,近年来，中国青少年性教育话题被广泛讨论，但对于残障青少年性教育，挑战仍很艰巨。,"In recent years, the topic of sex education for Chinese teenagers has been widely discussed, but the challenge for sex education for disabled teenagers is still arduous."

11715,会上发布的《中国残障儿童与青年的性相关知识、态度与行为报告》显示，残障儿童遭受性骚扰、性侵犯的比例高于健康儿童。,"""The report of sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of Chinese disabled children and young people"" released at the meeting reveals that the proportion of disabled children subjected to sexual harassment and abuse is higher than that of healthy children."
11716,对于残障儿童、青少年，社会上给予更多的也是“性保护”的关注。,"For disabled children and teenagers, what the society focuses on is the attention of ""sexual protection""."
11717,本次研讨会旨在从家庭支持、学校教育、机构服务三方面探讨在中国推进残障儿童与青少年全面性教育，从源头上为残障儿童与青少年提供支持，让他们和旁人一样，拥有自在享受爱的权利。,"This seminar aims at promoting the comprehensive sex education for disabled children and teenagers in China from three aspects of family support, school education and institution services, providing support to the disabled children and teenagers from the source, thus letting them enjoy the right of love as others do."
11718,专家认为，一直以来，中国社会公众对残障群体的认识都停留在一个不够深入的层面上。,Experts believe that the Chinese public understanding of disabled groups has remained at a level that is not deep enough for a long time.
11719,受传统观念等因素影响，中国对残障人士，尤其是残障儿童和青少年的全面性教育还不够深入。,"Being influenced by the traditional concept and other factors, the comprehensive sex education for the disabled, especially for the disabled children and teenagers in China, is not deep enough."
11720,但近年来，在联合国教科文组织和公益人士的支持下，中国残障人士全周期全面发展的性与生殖健康教育实践与实现路径有了可喜的发展。,"However, in recent years, with the support of the UNESCO and public-spirited people, the practice and implementation path of full-cycle comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education for the disabled in China have made gratifying progress."

11723,路透北京9月30日 - 中国央行周日公布外币资产预定短期流出净额数据显示，截至今年8月末央行的外币对本币远期合约和期货合约空头头寸连续12个月为零，当月仍无多头头寸。,"Report of the Reuters on September 30 in Beijing - People's Bank Of China released its predetermined short-term net outflow of foreign currency assets on Sunday and showed as of the end of August this year, its short positions in forward and futures contracts for foreign currencies vs local currencies remained zero for 12 consecutive months, and there were still no long position in that month."
11724,央行此前数据显示，截至去年8月末央行共持有外币对本币远期合约和期货合约空头头寸60.44亿美元，为连续第四个月不变；以SDR(特别提款权)计值的空头头寸规模为42.76亿SDR。,"Previous data from the People's Bank Of China showed that as of the end of August last year, the it had a total short position of $6.044 billion in forward and futures contracts for foreign currencies vs local currencies, unchanged for the fourth consecutive month; the short position in SDR (Special Drawing Rights) was 4.276 billion SDR."
11725,此后，央行的外汇远期空头头寸一直为零。,"Since then, the foreign exchange forwards short position of the People's Bank Of China remained zero."
11726,央行在2016年3月底首次公布该数据；数据显示2016年2月底央行的外币对本币远期合约和期货合约多头头寸24.38亿美元，空头头寸289亿美元。,"People's Bank Of China released the data for the first time at the end of March 2016; the data showed that at the end of February 2016, its long positions in forward and futures contracts for foreign currencies vs local currencies was US$2.438 billion and short positions was US$28.9 billion."

11728,央行此前曾表示，外币对本币的远期和期货空头头寸主要反映了央行为满足企业外币负债套期保值需求而与商业银行开展的外汇远期操作，将继续按实需原则提供远期避险产品，央行远期操作对未来外汇储备规模的影响较小。,"People's Bank Of China has previously said that the forward and futures short positions of foreign currencies vs local currencies mainly reflected the forward operations of foreign exchange carried out by the People's Bank Of China with commercial banks with the purpose of meeting the hedging needs of enterprises' foreign currency liabilities. It would continue to provide forward hedging products according to the principle of actual demand, and the forward operations of the People's Bank Of China would have minor impact on the scale of future foreign exchange reserves."
11729,"今年9月20日晚,K158次列车上,在郑州读大三的乔同学乘车去鹤壁。","On the evening of September 20 this year, on the K158 train, student Qiao, who was a junior in Zhengzhou, took the train to Hebi."
11730,"火车上一位大爷买的是无座票,却占了她的座 : “ 拍吧拍吧 ” 。","An elder uncle on the train bought a ticket without seat, but he took up her seat, and said: ""you can take photos, whatever""."
11731,"两个小时的车程,列车长劝了他一小时仍无效。","During the two hours of driving, the train conductor advised him for an hour, however it still had no results."
11732,"最终,同车厢的一名男乘客看不下去把大爷拽起。","In the end, a male passenger in the same carriage could not stand up and pulled up the elder uncle."
11733,"从舆情看,虽然最终结果大多都是霸座者被公众谴责、被公安部门行政处罚,甚至被纳入诚信黑名单,但是公众仍觉得不“解恨 ” : 为什么不能让霸座者当场受到处罚?","From the public opinion, although the final result is mostly that the persons who forcibly occupy seats are condemned by the public, administratively punished by the public security department, and even included in the blacklist of integrity, the public still feels that it does not ""vent their hates"": Why can’t the persons who forcibly occupy seats be punished on the spot?"
11734,为什么不能当场阻止其不道德甚至不合法的行为、而是事后才能对其进行处罚?,"Why can’t stop immoral or even illegal behavior on the spot, but can only punish it afterwards?"
11735,"而对于“霸座大爷”的无理行为,怎么只是一名男乘客“路见不平”而将其拽起?","And for the unreasonable behavior of ""the elder uncle who forcibly occupy seats"", why only a male passenger pull him up because of ""Road see injustice""?"
11736,"其主要原因是,只有长途列车上才配备有乘警,短途列车一般没有；即使有乘警,乘警也多顾虑到霸座者可能的无赖反应而没有采取强制带离措施。","The main reason is that only long-distance trains are equipped with railway policemen, and there is generally no railway policemen for short-distance trains; even if there is railway policemen, the passengers are more concerned about the possible rogue reactions of the persons who forcibly occupy seats and do not take compulsory taking away measures."
11737,"屡次出现的霸座事件让人们意识到,必须让霸座者当场被强制带离甚至被处罚才能起到震慑作用。",Repeated seats forcibly occupied events have made people realize that it is necessary to let the persons who forcibly occupy seats be forced to take away or even be punished on the spot.
11738,"这就要求,我们的列车乘警要敢于及时采取强有力措施,没有乘警的列车应该尽快配置乘警,以保全及时制止和打击违法行为。",This requires that our railway policemen should dare to take powerful measures in a timely manner. Trains that do not have policemen should make deployment as soon as possible to preserve and prevent illegal activities in a timely manner.

After understanding the general situation, the group leader Huang Xuemin immediately arranged the policemen on duty at the controlled site to contact with the help seeker and asked them to do the escort job well."

11744,北川交警禹里中队中队长笪魏介绍，急救车需要从唐家山堰塞湖环湖路绕行，且道路险峻狭窄，为防止已经进入该段道路的车辆行车双排并行，交警提前一个小时在道路的起、中、尾三个点位对车辆实行分段管制，并提醒所有通过的驾驶员要让开一边的道路，为急救车错车。,"The leader of Yuli Squadron of Beichuan Traffic Police Da Wei introduced that the emergency ambulance needed to bypass the Huanhu Road of Tangjiashan quake lake, and the road was steep and narrow. In order to prevent the vehicles in the road segment from running side by side, the traffic police implemented the subsection control of vehicles in the beginning, the middle and the end of the road an hour in advance and reminded all drivers passing through it to make a way for the emergency ambulance."

11747,据了解，环湖路有的地方只能一辆车通过，民警提前对这些地方进行临时管制，保证了120急救车顺利通过。,"It was learned that some places on Huanhu Road only permitted one vehicle passing through, and the police implemented the temporary control at these places so that the 120 emergency ambulance could successfully pass through."
11748,到达漩坪乡十里碑村时，有一段道路无法错让，于是交警提前与村两委取得联系，借用该村村道绕行，并禁止社会车辆进入。,"It was impossible to give way in a road segment in Shilibei Village in Daxuanping Town, so the traffic police got in touch with the village party branch and village committee in advance to use the village road for bypassing and stop the social vehicles from entering."
11749,“从北川交警接到120急救车到驶入302省道正常道路仅用了40分钟 。 ”,"""It only took 40 minutes from Beichuan Traffic Police met the 120 emergency ambulance to drive into the normal road of the 302 provincial highway. """

Authorities are worried that the number will rise, as rescue workers find it difficult to provide assistance to remote areas that have lost contact."
11754,尤其令人担忧的是栋格拉，巴鲁以北的这一地区人口为30万，接近这次地震的震中。,"What is particularly worrying is Donggala, the region north of Palu with a population of 300,000, which is close to the epicenter of this earthquake."

No road traffic accident involving more than 5 deaths was reported across the country, and no road traffic accident involving more than 3 deaths was reported in 29 provinces."
11792,当日上午，各地普遍迎来出行高峰，各大城市周边道路和高速公路交通流量大幅上升，局部路段以及收费站、服务区、桥梁、隧道、互通立交等节点因为流量过大、道路瓶颈、刮擦事故等原因，不同程度出现车辆缓行排队现象，特别是京津冀、长三角、珠三角、成渝地区较为突出；下午流量有所回落，道路交通逐步恢复。,"That morning, the peak travel generally occurred in many places, and the traffic volume of roads and highways around major cities increased significantly. There were different levels of slow moving traffics in some road segments and road nodes, including toll stations, service areas, bridges, tunnels, and interchanges, due to the reasons of excessive traffic flow, bottlenecks of the roads, scratching accidents, especially in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, Chengdu-Chongqing Region; the traffic volume decreased slightly in the afternoon, and the road traffic was gradually recovering."

11799,特雷莎·梅已然脆弱的领导力本月进一步承压，因欧盟拒绝了所谓的“契克斯 ” 计划的部分内容。,"Theresa May's already-fragile leadership bore further pressure this month, since the European Union rejected some content of the so-called ""Chequers"" plan."
11800,但特雷莎·梅积极地看待这些协商，称她准备考虑欧盟的疑虑。,"However, Theresa May actively treated these negotiations and said that she prepared to consider the concerns of the European Union."

He dismissed the president of Don Mueang International Airport and had him prosecuted."
11839,机场管理局负责人称，当时，这名中国游客不满被拒绝入境，不愿服从管理和待在遣返限定区域，于是与保安人员发生推搡和肢体冲突。,"The leader of the airport authority said that at that time, the Chinese tourist was dissatisfied at being denied for entry, unwilling to obey regulations and stay in a restricted area for repatriation, and then got into a scuffle and physical confrontation with the security personnel."
11840,目前，机场管理局已将该名保安停职。,"Currently, the airport authority has suspended the security staff from his duties."
11841,此事已对泰国旅游形象造成影响，廊曼机场方面对此事发生深表歉意，为了尽力弥补损失，下一步机场将通过中国大使馆对被袭击的该名中国游客当事人传达深切的歉意。,"This case has affected the Thai tourism image. The Don Mueang International Airport apologizes for the case. In order to make up for the loss, the airport will convey its deep apology to the Chinese tourist who was attacked through the Chinese Embassy."
11842,最后，机场总裁苏林瓦表示：依旧欢迎广大中国游客到泰国旅游，现在已经为入泰中国游客提供了更多帮助和便利，包括在入境时开放中国护照专用礼遇通道，其中素万那普机场开放18个，廊曼机场开放21个，普吉机场开放18个；清迈机场开放8个；合艾机场中国游客开放专用10个。,"Finally, Sullinwa, the president of the airport said that they still welcomed majority of Chinese tourists to travel to Thailand, and now they have offered the Chinese tourists more assistance and convenience, including opening the Chinese passport special courtesy channels at the time of entry, among them, 18 channels opening at the Suvarnabhumi Airport, 21 channels opening at the Don Mueang International Airportopen, 18 channels opening at the Phuket Airport, 8 channels opening at the Chiang Mai Airport and 18 special channels for Chinese tourists opening at the Hat Yai Airport."
11843,泰国头条新闻网从新任泰国国家移民局总局长、原泰国旅游警察总局副局长素拉切警少将处获悉，泰国副总理巴逸高度重视此事，已经下令开除肇事机场工作人员，并且对廊曼机场总裁撤职查办。,"The Thai headline news website learned from Police Major Su La Chi, the newly appointed general director of Thailand Immigration Bureau and the former deputy director of Thailand Tourism Police Bureau that the Thai deputy prime minister Bayi attached great importance to this matter and had ordered the dismissal of the airport staff. He dismissed the president of Don Mueang International Airport and had him prosecuted."
11844,本报讯(实习记者李祺瑶)近年来，多地曾发生校园塑胶跑道不合格的事件。,"Report from our correspondent (intern reporter, Li Qiyao): In recent years, the events of unqualified campus plastic runway have occurred in many regions."
11845,为此，教育部下发通知，要求今年11月1日后交付使用的中小学合成材料面层运动场地必须执行新国标。,"Therefore, the Ministry of Education issues a notice that requires the sport fields with surfaces made of synthetic materials for primary and secondary schools to implement the new national standard before delivery for use after November 1."
11846,强制性国家标准《中小学合成材料面层运动场地》由教育部牵头组织，26家科研院所和检测机构参与起草，历经两年多的修订，期间曾组织超过100次的专家会议论证，以及全国范围内的实地考察、抽样检验，收集了市场上数百家企业产品不计其数的验证实验。,"The mandatory national standard ""The sport fields with surfaces made of synthetic materials for primary and secondary schools"" is led by the Ministry of Education. 26 research institutes and testing organizations have participated in drafting the standard and it have gone through more than two years of revision. During that time, more than 100 meetings of expert argument were held, and the nationwide field studies and sampling inspections were implemented. Countless validation experiments have been collected from products of hundreds of enterprises on the market."
11847,记者对照2005年的旧国标发现，新国标不仅从“国家推荐标准” 变为 “国家强制标准 ” ， 还增加了诸多内容，包括厚度要求、物理性能、耐老化性能、无机填料含量要求、防滑胶粒高聚物含量要求、面层成品有害物质限量、非固体和固体原料有害物质限量等。,"The reporter contrasts the old national standard in 2005 and finds that the new national standard has not only changed from the ""national recommended standard"" to the ""national mandatory standard"", but also added a lot of content, including thickness requirements, physical properties, aging resistance, requirements for inorganic filler content, requirements for anti-slip colloidal particle polymer content, limits of harmful substances of surface finished products, limits of harmful substances of non-solid and solid materials, etc."
11848,尤其值得一提的是，新国标对校园塑胶跑道建设中可能产生的有害物质做出了限定，由原来的7项增至18项，并按照家装标准对建成后的跑道挥发性有机物限量做出了规定。,"In particular, the new national standard limits the harmful substances that may be produced in the construction process of campus plastic runway, increasing from 7 to 18 items, and stipulates the limits of volatile organic compounds in the built runway according to the standard of home decoration."
11849,如“现浇型和预制型面层成品中有害物质限量及气味要求”中明确规定了有害物质的释放量，要求总挥发性有机化合物不得高于5毫克/立方米，甲醛不得高于0.4毫克/立方米，二硫化碳不得高于7毫克/立方米，苯不得高于0.1毫克/立方米，气味等级不得高于3级。,"For example, the release amount of harmful substances is specified in the ""Limits of cast-in-situ and prefabricated surface finished products and odor requirements"", which requires that the total volatile organic compounds should not exceed 5 mg/cubic meter, formaldehyde should not exceed 0.4 mg/cubic meter, carbon disulfide should not exceed 7 mg/cubic meter, benzene should not exceed 0.1 mg/cubic meter, and the odor grade should not be higher than Grade 3."
11850,新国标还对中小学校园塑胶跑道的取样要求、检验规则、判定规则等问题作出了详细规定。,"The new national standard also stipulates in detail the sampling requirements, inspection rules and judgment rules of plastic runways of primary and secondary schools."
11851,此外，校园人工草坪也首次纳入国标强制检测范围。,"In addition, the campus artificial lawn has also been included in the mandatory testing scope of the national standard for the first time."
11852,近期各地要就新国标的实施开展专项的工作部署，并在年内将新国标落实情况报送教育部体育卫生与艺术教育司。,"In the near future, special work plans will be carried out for the implementation situation of the new national standard all over the country, and the implementation of the new national standard should be submitted to the Department of Sports Hygiene and Arts Education of the Ministry of Education within the year."
11853,中新网客户端成都9月30日电(王禹)30日下午，2018年女乒世界杯决赛赛场上演“国乒内战 ” 。,"ECNS Client, Chengdu, September 30 (reported by Wang Yu) -- There was an ""internal battle within the Chinese table tennis team"" at the 2018 ITTF Women's World Cup finals in the afternoon on September 30."
11854,最终，大满贯得主丁宁4:0力克主场作战的队友朱雨玲，时隔四年再次登上女乒世界杯冠军宝座，这也是中国女乒第21次摘下该项赛事桂冠。,"Ding Ning, the Grand Slam winner, finally secured an impressive 4-0 victory over her teammate Zhu Yuling, who was the host, and won the golden medal again in the ITTF Women's World Cup after four years. This was also the 21st time for the Chinese table tennis team to win the championship in the ITTF Women's World Cup."
11855,丁宁和朱雨玲即是队友，又是朋友，双方对彼此的技战术都相当熟悉。,"Ding Ning and Zhu Yuling are teammates and friends, so they are very familiar with each other's technique and tactics."
11856,无论是备战还是赛前热身，双方都如影随形。,"Regardless of preparing for the game or warming up before the game, they are very closely associated with each other."
11857,进入决赛，两人不约而同地表示已经完成比赛任务。,"After entering the finals, both of them invariably expressed that they had fulfilled their competition duties."
11858,但比赛中丁宁与朱雨玲之间的较量，堪称刀光剑影。,"However, the contest between Ding Ning and Zhu Yuling can be called as a hot battle."
11859,第一局，大赛经验占优的丁宁开局3：1领先，随后朱雨玲借助丁宁失误将比分追成3平。,"In the first set, due to her rich experience of competition, Ding Ning started in the ascendant and was 3-0 ahead. Then, Zhu Yuling took advantage of the mistakes made by Ding Ning and tied it at 3."
11860,随后朱雨玲在进攻中的失误开始增加，丁宁抓住机会连得3分9：5领先，并以10：6率先拿到局点。,"Subsequently, Zhu Yuling made increasing mistakes in attack, while Ding Ning seized this opportunity to get 3 points in a row with a 9-5 lead, and was the first to get the game point at 10-6."
11861,虽然朱雨玲连追3分，但丁宁还是利用发球以11：9拿下首局。,"Although Zhu Yuling got 3 points straightly, Ding Ning took the opportunity of serving to win 11-9 in the first set."
11862,第二局，朱雨玲的失误依然居高不下，丁宁借助在相持中的优势以6：1遥遥领先。,"In the second set, Zhu Yuling still made a lot of mistakes, while Ding Ning made good use of the advantage of being locked in a stalemate and held a safe lead at 6-1."
11863,朱雨玲在2：7落后的情况下，依靠节奏改变连得2分，并且随后利用进攻一度将比分追到8：9。,"Despite being 2-7 behind, Zhu Yuling got 2 points straightly by changing her pace, and then narrowed the gap to 8-9 for a time by taking advantage of attacking."
11864,关键时刻，丁宁连得2分11：8再胜一局。,"At this crucial moment, Ding Ning got 2 points straightly and won again in the second set at 11-8."
11865,第三局，两人开局咬得比较紧打成3：3平。,"Early in the third set, their scores were rather close resulting in a draw at 3-3."
11866,随后丁宁在进攻中失误增多连丢3分，不过她随后利用犀利进攻连得3分将比分追到6平。,"Then, Ding Ning made increasing mistakes in attack and lost 3 points in a row. However, she got 3 points straightly in sharp attack to find an equalizer at 6-6."
11867,朱雨玲连得2分再次建立优势，并以10：8率先拿到局点。,"Zhu Yuling got 2 points straightly to build her advantage again, and was the first to get the game point at 10-8."
11868,但是丁宁进攻极为凶狠，连得4分后反以12：10拿下第三局。,"However, Ding Ning played so hard and so aggressive, and won the third set at 12-10 after getting 4 points in a row."
11869,第四局，朱雨玲开局取得4：2领先。,"In the fourth set, Zhu Yuling made a good start and was 4-2 ahead."
11870,但此后丁宁展现了超强的进攻状态，连得4分后打停朱雨玲。,"However, Ding Ning showed her ultra strong attacking power soon afterward and got 4 points in a row forcing Zhu Yuling to call a timeout."
11871,暂停回来后，朱雨玲找回一些状态，逐渐将比分追到8：8平。,"After the timeout, Zhu Yuling bounced back a bit and gradually tied the score at 8-8."
11872,关键时刻，丁宁没有手软，连得2分拿到赛点。,"At this critical moment, Ding Ning had no mercy and got 2 points straightly to reach the match point."
11873,随着朱雨玲回球出界，丁宁4：0横扫对手夺冠。,"As Zhu Yuling returned the ball out of bounds, Ding Ning won 4-0 over her rival to take the crown."
11874,上个月，丁宁在保加利亚公开赛摘得桂冠，终结了自己长达14个月的冠军荒，此番来到成都，尽管她在赛前表示自己征战本次比赛并没有设定目标，而在上午结束的半决赛中，丁宁说自己已经完成任务。,"Last month, Ding Ning was crowned the winner of the Bulgaria Open and ended her 14-month trophy drought. Although she expressed before the game that she hadn't set any goals for this game in Chengdu, she revealed after the semi-finals in the morning that she had fulfilled her duties."
11875,最终丁宁战胜队友朱雨玲，获得个人第三个世界杯冠军，她对自己的表现表示满意 ： “ 一个冠军对每个运动员而言都很重要。,"Finally, Ding Ning defeated her teammate Zhu Yuling to win the third World Cup champion of her own. She was satisfied with her performance: ""The champion is very important to every athlete."
11876,赛前自己没想到这个，只是说一场场去拼，决赛自己发挥还是非常满意的 。 ”,"I haven't thought of winning the champion before the game. I just want to try my best in each game. I'm very satisfied with my performance in the finals. """
11877,主场作战的川妹子朱雨玲收获一枚银牌，没有完成卫冕的目标，谈及主场热情的观众是否会对自己造成无形的压力时，她说 ： “ 我觉得整个比赛我在压力方面处理的还可以，今天丁宁的发挥非常出色，导致自己一直没有找到节奏 。 ”,"As the host, Sichuan girl Zhu Yuling won a silver medal, failing to complete the goal of defending. When talking about whether the enthusiastic home crowd would pose invisible pressure on her, she said: ""I feel that I'm doing well in dealing with pressure in the whole game. Ding Ning is playing very well today, but I haven't found my pace. """
11878,激活农村消费，要靠常态化机制净化市场，引导健康消费需求，提升农民消费上的获得感。,"For activating rural consumption, it is necessary to rely on the normalization mechanism to purify the market, guide the demand for healthy consumption, and enhance the sense of gain in farmers’ consumption."
11879,数据显示，农村居民消费潜力持续释放，今年上半年乡村消费品零售额增长10.5 % ， 增速高出城镇1.3个百分点。,"According to data, the consumption potentiality of rural residents has been continuously released. In the first half of this year, the retail sales of rural consumer goods increased by 10.5%, and the growth rate is 1.3 percentage points higher than that of towns."
11880,在西部某县一个贫困村走访，全村只有一家便利店，走进店里，一些商品似曾相识 ， “ 金龙鱼”标成“金龙油 ” ， “旺仔”成了“旺奶 ” ， “山寨”商品不少。,"During the visit to a poor village in a western county, there is only one convenience store in the whole village. Stepping into the store, some items are the brands we familiar with, however there are lots of fake good, such as ""金龙鱼"" is labeled as ""金龙油"" and ""旺仔"" labeled as ""旺奶""."
11881,这些年来，类似现象频频曝出，一些农村假劣商品傍名牌，名称相近、包装相似、以假乱真，令人防不胜防。,"Over the years, similar phenomena have been frequently exposed. Some rural fake and inferior products imitate famous brands, they have similar names and packages to mix the false with the genuine, which is really hard to prevent."
11882,西部某市发布的一项消费调查报告显示，农村商超假货问题严重，有66%的用户在乡镇线下超市买过假货，其中食品占一半以上。,"A consumer survey report released by a city in the west shows that rural shopping malls and supermarkets have a serious problem of fake products, and 66% of users have bought fakes in supermarkets in villages and towns offline, of which food accounts for more than half."
11883,有关部门整治农村市场，年年喊打，为何“李鬼”仍屡打不绝？,"The relevant departments claim to rectify the rural markets every year, while, why the phenomena of fake products still occur repeatedly?"
11884,与城市市场不同，农民维权意识相对不强，再加上不少农村位置偏远，处于监管力量够不着的盲区，让假劣商品有了滋生土壤。,"Different from the urban markets, farmers’ awareness of rights protection is relatively weak, and many villages are in remote locations within the blind areas of inspection force can’t reach, so that the fake and inferior goods have a breeding ground."
11885,一个商品多头管，有的部门管价格，有的管生产，有的管市场，职能交叉，年年打假，集中治理一阵风，假货躲过风头，又慢慢冒出来，刚打完旧假，新假又冒出来。,"One product has more than one regulatory departments, some are responsible for price, some are for production, and others are for markets, so the functions are overlapped. Strong measures against fake and inferior products have been taken every year, however the central management can only last for a period of time. On one hand, the fakes escape the crack down trend and slowly emerged, on the other hand, the previous fakes just have been dealt and the new fake came out."
11886,缺乏长效监管机制，农村市场难净化，违法成本低，利益大，致使一些不法商贩动起了“上山下乡”的歪脑筋，一些农村地区成为“消废市场 ” 。,"Some unscrupulous traders have initiated the idea of ""going to the mountainous areas and the countryside"" and some rural areas become the ""waste elimination markets"", both of these problems are because of long-term supervision mechanism, difficulties in purifying rural markets, low illegal cost and higher profit."
11887,从温饱到小康，广大农民正迈向发展型消费。,"From food and clothing to well-off, the majority of farmers are moving towards development type consumption."
11888,日前，党中央、国务院发布《关于完善促进消费体制机制 进一步激发居民消费潜力的若干意见 》 ， 其中提出推动农村居民消费梯次升级，目的是让广大农民“能消费 ” “ 愿消费 ” “ 敢消费 ” ， 让农村消费真正旺起来。,"A few days ago, the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued the ""Some Opinions concerning Stimulating the Consumption Mechanism to Further Encourage the Consumption Potential of Residents"", which proposed to promote the level upgrading of the consumption of rural residents. The purpose is to make the majority of farmers to ""have ability to consume"", ""have willing to consume"" and ""dare to consume"" to let the rural consumption really flourish."
11889,一方面要深化改革，消除市场监管政出多门、多头管理弊端，因地制宜，健全食品安全、产品质量监督网络，不断压缩农村制假、售假的空间。,"On the one hand, we must deepen reforms, eliminate drawbacks of market management policies coming from multiple departments and regulate by more than one departments. According to local conditions, improve the food safety, product quality supervision network, and constantly reduce the space for rural fake products manufacturing and selling."
11890,另一方面，要加大执法力度，打通监管“毛细血管 ” ， 决不允许假冒伪劣在农村滋生蔓延。,"On the other hand, it is necessary to intensify law enforcement and open up the supervision of each department, and never allow the fake and inferior commodities to breed in the countryside."
11891,严惩坑农才是护农，不论制假者藏得多隐蔽，都不应成为假劣商品滋生的理由，相关部门应明确职责，基层监管力量下沉，哪个环节出问题，就要追究责任，让制假、售假者无处藏身。,"It is the protection for farmers to severely punish the behavior of entrapping farmers. No matter how concealed the counterfeiters hide, it should not be the reason for the breeding of the fake and inferior commodities. Relevant departments should clarify their responsibilities, and the grassroots supervisory powers should go down. If there is a problem in any part, it is necessary to investigate the responsibility and let the counterfeiters and selling persons have nowhere to hide."
11892,严把市场准入关，对生产经营者实行严格资格审查，把住市场流通关，让产品来路正、去路清，从源头、根子上想办法，让合法经销者安心经营，让农民买得放心。,"Strictly control the market access, implement strict qualification examinations for production operators. Keep the market circulation, let the products have clear sources and outlet markets. Think of ways from the source and the roots, let the legal dealers operate with peace of mind, and let the farmers buy with confidence."
11893,激活农村消费，要引导健康消费需求。,"Activate rural consumption, guide the demand for healthy consumption."
11894,伴随消费升级，许多农民不仅追求吃得饱、吃得好，还追求文化、健康等高质量生活，不能把农村市场跟“低质 ” “ 廉价”画等号。,"As consumption upgrading, many farmers not only pursue of well fed and eat well, but also go after for high quality life with culture and healthy. Thus, rural markets are not equal to ""low quality"" and ""low price""."
11895,这需要推动电子商务向广大农村延伸覆盖，畅通城乡双向联动销售渠道，促进线下产业发展平台和线上电商交易平台结合，支持消费新业态新模式向农村市场拓展；推动具备条件的乡镇将商贸物流与休闲农业、乡村旅游、产品加工等有机结合；健全农村现代流通网络体系，优化整合存量设施资源，有效降低农村流通成本。,"This needs to promote the extension of e-commerce to the vast rural areas, connect the urban and rural two-way linkage sales channels, promote the combination of offline industry development platform and online e-commerce trading platform, support the new forms and new modes of consumption to expand into the rural market; promote qualified villages and towns to combine trade logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, and product processing dynamically; improve the rural modern circulation network system, optimize the integration of stock facilities resources, and effectively reduce rural circulation costs."
11896,为农村营造一个清朗、放心的市场环境，让农民消费不揪心，农村消费才能越来越旺，才能提升农民消费的获得感、幸福感。,"Create a clear and reassuring market environment for the rural areas, so that farmers can afford to buy, so that the rural consumption can become more and more prosperous and the farmers’ senses of gain and happiness can be enhanced."
11897,11月1日起我国降部分商品最惠国税率，关税总水平将降至7.5 %,"Our country will reduce the MFN tariff rate for some goods from November 1, and the general tariff level will be reduced to 7.5%."
11898,根据国务院第26次常务会议决定，国务院关税税则委员会30日印发公告，自2018年11月1日起，降低部分商品的最惠国税率。,"According to the decision of the 26th executive meeting of the State Council, the Tariff Commission of the State Council announced on September 30 that the MFN tariff rate for some goods would be reduced from November 1, 2018."
11899,"根据《国务院关税税则委员会关于降低部分商品进口关税的公告 》 ， 为适应产业升级、降低企业成本和满足群众多层次消费等需求,从今年11月1日起，降低部分工业品等商品的最惠国税率。","According to the ""Tariff Commission of the State Council's Announcement on Reducing the Import Tariff for Some Goods"", the MFN tariff rate for some goods, including the industrial goods, would be reduced from November 1, 2018 in order to adapt to the industrial upgrading, reduce the enterprise costs, and satisfy people's demands of multilevel consumption."
11900,降税商品共1585个税目，约占我国税目总数的19 % ， 平均税率由10.5%降至7.8 % ， 平均降幅为26 % 。,"There were 1585 taxable items in total for the tax reduction goods, which accounted for about 19% of total taxable items in our country. The average tax rate was reduced from 10.5% to 7.8% by an average of 26%."
11901,本次降税主要涉及纺织品；石材、陶瓷、玻璃制品；部分钢铁及贱金属制品；机电设备及零部件，如金属加工机械、纺织机械、工程机械、输变电设备、电工器材、仪器仪表等；资源性商品及初级加工品，如非金属矿、无机化学品、木材及纸制品、宝玉石等。,"This tax reduction mainly involved the textiles; stones, ceramics, glass products; some steel and base metal products; electromechanical devices and parts, such as metal processing machinery, textile machinery, engineering machinery, electric transmission and transformation equipment, electrical appliances, instruments and apparatus, etc.; resource goods and primary processed goods, such as non-metal ores, inorganic chemicals, wood and paper products, gemstone and jade, etc."
11902,同时，随着关税总水平尤其是药品、日用消费品进口关税的下调，相应下调进境物品进口税的税目税率。,"Meanwhile, with the reduction of general tariff level, especially the import tariff reduction of medicine and consumer goods, the taxable items and tax rate for import tax on imported goods would be reduced accordingly."
11903,为贯彻落实党中央、国务院的决策部署，我国已于今年5月1日起对绝大多数进口药品实施了零关税，7月1日起降低了汽车及零部件、部分日用消费品的进口关税，实施了信息技术协议扩围产品第三步降税。,"In order to implement the decisions and deployments of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, our country had implemented the zero tariff on most imported drugs since May 1 this year, had reduced the import tariff for automobiles and parts and some consumer goods since July 1, and had implemented the third step of tax reduction for products in the extended scope of Information Technology Agreement."
11904,记者从国务院关税税则委员会了解到，今年以来，经过连续多次自主调整，我国关税总水平将由上年的9.8%降至7.5 % ， 平均降幅达23 % 。,"The reporter learned from the Tariff Commission of the State Council that the general tariff level in our country was reduced from 9.8% of the previous year to 7.5%, by an average of 23% after several continuous independent adjustments."
11905,适当降低关税，有利于促进对外贸易平衡发展，推进更高水平对外开放，也有利于统筹利用国际国内两种资源，推进国内供给侧结构性改革。,"Proper tariff reduction would be beneficial to accelerating the balanced development of foreign trade, promoting the higher-level opening to the outside world, overall planning and using the international and domestic resources, and boosting the domestic supply-side structural reform."
11906,该委员会有关负责人表示，今年是改革开放40周年，主动降低关税总水平是落实习近平总书记在博鳌亚洲论坛重要讲话精神的实际行动，也是我国根据自身高质量发展需要进一步扩大开放、主动扩大进口的重要举措，这一行动和举措表明中国将坚定不移奉行互利共赢的开放战略，在增强自身发展动力的同时，也让中国发展更好惠及世界。,"The relevant responsible person of the Commission said that this year was the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening-up. Taking the initiative to reduce the general tariff level was the practical action of implementing the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Boao Forum for Asia, and our country's important measure of further opening up and actively expanding imports based on our demand for high-quality development. These action and measure showed that China would unswervingly pursue the mutually beneficial opening-up strategy, strengthen the motive of self-development, and deliver benefits to the world through its development."
11907,9月29日，甘肃省环县“环乡人”农产品区域公共品牌发布会在天津市南开区举行。,"On September 29th, the regional public brand launch event for the ""Huanxiangren"" agricultural products of Huan County, Gansu Province was held in Nankai District, Tianjin."
11908,红军小米、黑小豆、山童牧歌黑山羊、精装苦荞茶、剪纸皮影册、纯手工拖鞋 … … 一件件包装精美的农产品整齐的摆放在展台上，它们有一个共同的品牌名称叫“环乡人 ” 。,"Red Army millet, black bean, mountain kids madrigal black goat, hardcover buckwheat tea, paper-cutting shadow puppets book, handmade slippers... All pieces of beautifully packaged agricultural products is neatly placed on the stand, they have a common brand name called ""Huangxiangren""."
11909,“打造‘环乡人’区域品牌，有效的解决了环县农产品‘多而散、小而弱’的发展瓶颈，更是成为脱贫攻坚的有力载体 。 ”29日，甘肃环县主办的“环乡人”农产品区域公共品牌发布会在天津市南开区举行。,"""Create a regional brand of ""Huanxiangren"" has effectively solved the development bottleneck of agricultural products in the Huan County, which is ‘more but not centralized, small and weak’, and it has become a powerful carrier for poverty alleviation."" On September 29th, the regional public brand launch event for the ""Huanxiangren"" agricultural products hosted by Huan County, Gansu Province was held in Nankai District, Tianjin."
11910,环县地处陕甘宁三省区交界，作为“全国粮食生产先进县 ” “ 中国小杂粮之乡 ” “ 中国皮影之乡 ” ， 历史悠久、资源富集。,"Huan County is located at the junction of the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu and Ningxia. It is known as the ""National Grain Production Advanced County"", ""China’s Minor Grain Crops Township"" and ""China’s Shadow Puppets Township"". It has a long history and rich resources."
11911,羊羔肉、黄米酒、荞剁面、燕面柔柔等地方小吃更是身处他乡的游子时常想起的味道。,"Local snacks such as lamb meat, yellow millet wine, buckwheat noodles, and oat noodles are the flavors that people often think of when they are away from their hometown."
11912,随着中国城镇化水平不断提高，城市人口快速增多，大量乡村年轻人离开故乡开始城市生活。,"As the level of urbanization in China continues to increase, the urban population has increased rapidly, and a large number of rural young people have left their hometowns to start urban life."
11913,中国农业品牌研究专家杨巧佳说 ： “ 现在城市生活节奏快、压力大，越来越多的人开始怀念小时候的乡村生活，但是 ， ‘ 回不去的叫故乡，最美的记忆是乡村 ’ ， ‘环乡人’品牌设计就是以在外漂泊环县人的乡情和乡愁而命名的 。 ”,"Yang Qiaojia, an expert on agricultural brand research in China, said: ""Currently, urban life is fast-paced and stressful. More and more people are beginning to miss their rural life when they were young. However, ‘the place that cannot go back is the hometown, and the most beautiful memory is from the country’, the brand design of ‘Huanxiangren’ is named after the provincialism and homesickness of the wandering people of Huanhuan County. """

On October 19, they contacted their relatives and friends in China and said they would immediately explore the mountains near the Khovsgol Lake.
